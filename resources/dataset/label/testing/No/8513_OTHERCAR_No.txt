            Well, now, this is an interesting development, isn't it... Last week when I arrived at my local Enterprise Rent-a-car office to pick up a vehicle to take to Houston, all they had left was a Dodge Ram pickup. That's not their fault, of course -- the number of rental cars within about 300 miles of Houston was pretty thin while everyone waited for their insurance adjustor to declare all those drowned cars totaled.

It was no big deal --  I'd been wanting to try out one of the full-size pickups, just for grins, and also to compare it to the family Toyotas (yes, there are two of 'em, both 4WD). So I motored on out of the parking lot in a "Dodge Red" 1500 extended cab (SLT Laredo package) with one of those big V8s and and an automatic transmission. My exposure to the Ram during this rental? three days and 465 miles -- about 350 of it freeway driving. 


<b>A thirty-plus year history with Dodge</b>

I was walking through the parking lot at my office on Friday afternoon, when I passed a little car that brought back some fond memories -- a 1965 Dodge Dart. I drove one of these guys back in '69-'70 (it was my parents', but I was between cars at the time).

Anybody out there remember those things? By the standards of the day, A Dodge Dart was both economical and durable: that means it got maybe 16-18 MPG and was capable of lasting 110K miles without a major overhaul. The Dart's standard slant-six engine raised the bar significantly when Chrysler introduced it in the mid sixties. Since those days, though, the Chrysler family has fallen on hard times -- little innovation in engines, little innovation in style. Don't believe me? all you need do is consider the Neon... Oh, sure, they pioneered the minivan, but we all know how long <i>that</i> boom lasted before the SUVs arrived, and the Dodge Caravan's automatic transmission has always been widely derided as a money pit.

I had hoped that Dodge trucks had upheld the proud tradition of Chrysler products from the fifties and sixties, but (to be honest) I was pretty certain that they hadn't.

The jury's still out on that, I'm afraid.


<b>The second time around?</b>

Several months ago, I drove a 2001 Durango equipped much like the Ram pickup I drove last week -- V8, automatic. I determined that I didn't like the Durango all that much: it got lousy gas mileage, suffered from lack of forethought in design, rode like a log truck, and suffered from poor quality control. 

Guess what? There's almost no difference: the Ram also sucks down gasoline like a camel after three weeks in the desert, and wallows around on the road like a drunken gurnsey. The quality control in the Ram I drove is somewhat better, but the engineering and design are, like the Durango, outdated. 


<b>The high points</b>

The Ram's cab is spacious and quiet for a pickup. The bench seat can comfortably hold three adults. For only two passengers, the center seat-back folds down to create an oversized arm rest with a huge console compartment. The previous renter left his lottery tickets in there, but none were winners (darn!). The compartment has one section large enough to hold a fifth of scotch (Ms scmrak's favorite, Glenlivet French Oak finish) and a couple of smaller cubbyholes for change and so forth. There's a medium-sized, locking glove box as well.

The SLT model included a good-quality four-speaker sound system, cruise control, and air conditioning that stood up to a Houston afternoon. 

The extended cab features "suicide doors" on both sides to allow access/entry to the rear compartment (hinges on the back). The seat folds flat against the rear wall to allow carrying a little cargo, and forms a full-width bench that will seat three <b>very</b> short-legged folks. There are mounting points for car seats as well. It's just an extended cab, though, so no adult should be subjected to this space for more than a few miles...

The drive train on my 2WD rental featured a massive V8 engine with a three-speed automatic transmission (column-mounted shift). The engine is sufficiently powerful for heady-duty towing, and delivers strong acceleration with reserve power for the bursts of power sometimes necessary on freeways.

The vehicle includes both driver and passenger-side airbags, with a passenger-side cutoff switch mounted on the dashboard.


<b>The neutral realm</b>

It's a truck. It's a big truck. So you shouldn't expect the Ram 1500 to corner like it's on rails, zip into tight parking spaces, or ride like a luxury sedan. It doesn't do any of those things. It does, however, have a bed large enough to hold a sheet of plywood flat on the floor (and still close the tailgate) -- a feature over which this compact pickup owner definitely salivates.


<b>The Downside</b>

The twenty-six gallon gas tank gets empty <i>real</i> fast: in 165 miles of mostly freeway driving, it burned 13.2 gallons -- that's 12.5 MPG. That's <i>not</i> very good, if you ask me.

The tailgate must weigh about seventy pounds. I was expecting to be able to raise it with one hand (as on my Toyotas) -- boy, was I surprised! 

Overall quality control was average or better, but I was surprised to hear rattling from the doors after just 12000 miles of use. 

The dash layout is rather crude -- what engineer ever decided to stash an odometer in the lower left-hand corner of the instrument panel? And the gages all use those ugly spermatozoan needles that every Chrysler product I've driven lately features (round black head, red tail). 

Worst of all is the ride. The truck handles reasonably well on the freeway, I'll admit, but on city streets the handling and ride are almost nightmarish. An irregular stretch of road leaves the passengers bouncing like your old underwear circulating in a washing machine! At times I found myself holding the steering wheel in a death grip to avoid hitting the door and ceiling. Not good, not good at all. I simply cannot imagine ever taking a truck with this sloppy a suspension off road.


<b>Some suggestions</b>

In my research, I found that the Ram hasn't had a significant design change in about eight years (1994 was the last). I have a few suggestions for D-C when they decide to do a redesign:

1) Work on the suspension. <b>A lot!</b> There's no reason that you can't stiffen the ride a bit for the times when the truck isn't carrying a load [a note -- on the way back from Houston, I counted loaded pickup beds vs empty beds -- the pickups I saw were running about 80% empty].
2) See if you can strike a more reasonable balance between fuel economy and power. This is, by most accounts, a durable engine with better-than-average quality, but it is too inefficient for the size of the vehicle.
3) Update your interior.


<b>A parting shot</b>

The current advertising campaign calls the Ram the "mother of all trucks." Two questions for D-C's ad department:

* is Saddam Hussein getting royalties for the "mother of..." 
* wouldn't a <i>Ram</i> be the </i> father</i> of all trucks?  Huh?
