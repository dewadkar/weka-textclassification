            We shopped around for a long time before we stumbled on to the Quest Mini-van. We purchased ours in 1998. In the first few months I wasn't too sure if we made the right choice. There was a problem with the brakes, so it was in the shop twice. And then the lock on the side door let go, so we were back to the shop again. Once we got these little ticks taken care of, we were well on our way. We have 28,000 miles on it so far, and we have had no problems. It is easy to drive, everything is well in reach. It rides very nice. The only thing that we don't like is that it doesn't seem to have as much room inside as some of the other mini-vans. But it has been so good, that we wouldn't part with it now. Also it is a sharp looking van, from the outside and it gets very good gas mileage. 

***UPDATE***

I am sorry about the first review, it was one of my first and I guess I was not too sure on what exactly to write. Anyway, I wanted to let you know how out Quest is holding up.

We now have 50,000 miles on it. The brakes have been replaced now. But the design of the wheel lets a lot of dust into the brakes and they tend to squeal. Living on a dirt road intensifies the effect. We usually hose them down every three or four weeks now. 

Also the belts need replacing also. But from what I understand, this is normal after so many miles. So we will be scheduling this service soon. And out locks don't always work properly. This started over the last couple of weeks. You can press the lock button on the key and only the front doors lock. But you are aware of it because the horn won't sound unless all of them lock. Which, after a couple of tries, it does work. 

Also, the window button on the passengers side is broken. You can put the window down but not up. That has to be done from the driver side.

All in all, at this point in time, my van is okay. Would I buy another? Probably not. I am just not as satisfied with it as I was in the beginning. Too many little things going on.
