            I basically like the S2000. Ive driven against them and Ive driven in them and I have to say that the suspension is taut and the chassis is really stiff. The car is controllable and very fast through the corners. The engine is also really strong in the top end and sounds awesome. The car does very well in its autox class. 

Now for the bad news. The car is very very expensive, especially if you live in CA. The dealers here gouge to the tune of about 5k, for starters. Good luck getting a 2 year old s2000 for less than 3k over the original MSRP. 

The powerband is very peaky, and has a flat spot around 5.5-7k. This problem hurts the S2000 coming out of turns since the flat spot is just above where you can downshift. Honda has pretty much said this problem will be fixed in a few years as they switch to VTEC-i for all their cars. This isnt a really noticeable problem in street driving. However, keep in mind that the car is going to be noticeably faster in about a year and a half.

The car is pretty much maxxed out in terms of engine output and suspension performance. If you like to fix up your car, you will be seeing a lot money going into "10% increases". 11:1 compression means no forced induction and stock 9k rpm means no cams for you. If you dont want to modify your car, the s2000 is a very appealing package in a stock car. 

Ive heard the first year cars have problems with oil leaks (porous block) and rare engine failures, but this isnt relevant unless youre the owner of a problem car. I think the biggest problem with the car is the insane price- I am reminded of when the miata first came out. As with the miata, i think the price will eventually come down.
