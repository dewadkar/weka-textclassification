            BUYER PLEASE BEWARE - THEY DO NOT CARE.....:(  :(  :(

I purchased a brand new 2002 GMC Envoy in November of 2001.  I loved the vehicle.  It is a new model put out by General Motors.  Basically, that makes me one of the guinea pigs for them to work out the kinks.  I really didn't mind this because it truly is a nice SUV.  I purchased an extended warranty and I felt CONFIDENT that this would cover me and it took away my INITIAL APPREHENSION.

Well, I don't like to admit this.....but,  I was in fact VERY SADLY MISTAKEN.  The commercials and the web site which guarantee to protect your investment are just that....Simply Advertising.  

I have had many many problems with this vehicle.  My repair file is almost one inch thick.  I ran out of gas twice while the vehicle said I had One Half Tank.  Roadside assistance wouldn't bring me gas since it happened at home.  I finally after several months was able to prove to them that I needed a new sending unit.  You would not believe what I had to go through.  I had to go to the dealership and pick up the Service Manager everytime I needed gas and let him clock the mileage and check the reading on the gauge.  This is because the computer said it was fine.  It does not matter that I kept running out of gas since the computer said it was fine.

I had to call General Motors and fight and argue to get it fixed.  This problem originated in December of 2001 and the sending unit (float) was finally replaced in May of 2002.
That's right - after you spend just under $40,000.00 for your brand new vehicle it takes you 6 months to get one problem resolved.

The other problem I have is the mileage meter.  You see it has a mind of its own.  It changes all the time.  Finally, I got lucky and it changed and went down right after they had serviced it.  This time the Service Manager looked at the VIN number and he knew it was the same car.  His answer was to keep track daily.  Again I will ask you is this what you expect after you spend $40,000.00?

Since May of 2002 - and it is now August 29, 2002 my service engine soon light has been on.  The code comes up with a vapor emission problem.  The car has been serviced for this and each time they are unable to resolve it and I am without the vehicle.  I get the vehicle back and within 100 miles the light is back on.  So basically all they are doing is turning off the light and not fixing the cause.  I wonder what the EPA thinks about a bad emission code on a brand new vehicle. 

The other problem is this banging noise that is sporadic and gives no warning.  It just starts to bang and scares you half to death and then goes away for months.  They of course have not been able to duplicate that either.  The service manager was in the vehicle once when it happened but he has no idea of the cause. 

When I attempt to get fuel which is very often due to the small size of the gas tank it keeps clicking off.  You can guess how popular I am with the gas attendant.  This means that I pay for lost gas all the time.  They have no way to tell when it is full until it spills out on the ground.  Sometimes when I drive after I get gas the car has a vapor lock (I am not sure if that is what it is called) but you will be driving and the motor with no warning just dies.  This usually happens when the car is overfilled which is most of the time.  But you know this problem cannot be duplicated either.  

I have asked them to buy the car back and let them figure out the problems and honor their commitment TO PROTECT MY INVESTMENT.  They refused and told me to pursue it legally.  I am covered under the Lemon Law and I am sure that I will receive restitution.  I have spent 9 months filled with stress and inconvenience and it could all be avoided if they would have allowed the repairs.  The new way of functioning on warranty work requires permission from regional managers to perform work.  You are not however, permitted to speak to the regional managers that make these decisions.  This is similar to an HMO type of procedure.

I am 44 years old and have always owned General Motors Products.  I will NEVER again purchase a product from GM.  I have no faith in them at all or in their statement to PROTECT MY INVESTMENT.  I was willing to take another GMC ENVOY because I really do love the SUV, but after all this time and their lack of concern with my purchase I can honestly say that I do not want another one.  

I know that when you manufacture many vehicles you will have a percentage of LEMONS.  It is only natural.  That is why I would have accepted another Envoy.  But now I am quite afraid to drive this car and will not take the car on the highway.  It is too unreliable and I am in fear every time I drive it.

BUYER PLEASE BEWARE - THEY DO NOT CARE.....:(  :(  :(
