            I recieved the Smile as a gift last Christmas, and was excited to have my first digicam. That excitement quickly waned, though, as I realized the shortcomings of the product.

This camera has a resolution so brutally low that it is difficult to take any kind of clear picture. Even with the flash on, pictures are dark and require editing to fix. Let's not forget the battery drain - I use rechargeable batteries to run it, and the camera drains them before I can even move pictures from the camera to the PC. Of course, moving them is slow anyway due to the lack of USB support.

Yes, it does have its good sides. It is very inexpensive, and is good to have for kids who are budding photographers. However, that is about all I can suggest.<br><br>
