            I bought this vehicle because I thought it would be a good economical car. I have always thought Pontiac manufactured good cars. The car is good on gas and its pretty nice looking.But...... If you get the Quad four engine you have got a mess on your hand the engine is very badly manufactured. I have had many headaches out of this engine and the worst part about it no mechanic want to work on the engine. I feel they should recall this engine and fix what ever the problem is. I have had too many people complain about this same engine. The vehicle drives good when its running. A rich person should buy this vehicle because only they will be able to afford to keep buying engines to go in it. If you live on a fixed income leave the Pontiac Grandam Quad four ALONE.....................<br><br>
