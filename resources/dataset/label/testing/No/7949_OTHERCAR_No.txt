            My two favorite cars were always the early 1990's Camaro and the Jeep Wangler.  Well I bought a Camaro and drove it for a while and then I decided that I wanted to buy my first brand new car.  So I went out and bought a 1997 Jeep Wrangler.  At first I was pretty happy with it.  Then about 3 month in to ownership the heater core blew open and anit-freeze leaked all over the floor.  The dealer fixed it, with a little pushing.  Then in August of 1998, with only 28,000 miles on the truck, I started to have problems with it hesitating, oil pressure dropping and a knocking that made it sound like a diesel.  Because I had moved, I wanted to bring it to the dealer closest to my home.  That dealer looked at the truck and said that there was nothing wrong with the truck and that the knocking noise was normal engine noise.  Now, I maybe a girl but I am not car stupid, I know when there is something wrong. So, I decided to get a second opinion, same answer.  Finally, my husband went with me to the dealer that I bought the truck from and after him having a talk with the tech.  they brought the truck in and took a look at it.  Well, after all of that, they had to rebuild the engine because one of the connecting rods had broken.  They originally tried to get a new motor from Chrysler, but after getting 3 that were no good the rebuilt it.  Well, after a 2 months of not having the truck I went out and bought a new car.  I picked up the truck and went to bring it to the dealer that took it as a trade in and it was over heating and the oil pressure was still dropping.  I was very disappointed with the truck and the service, especially when the service managers saw that I was walking in with an infant.  Let the buyer beware -- there is no pride in craftsmanship these days.<br><br>
