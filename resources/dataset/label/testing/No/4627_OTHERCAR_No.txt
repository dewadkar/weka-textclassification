             Prospective BMW buyers beware! If you are considering purchasing a BMW 7 series, do yourself the favor of a lifetime and read this Epinion...

 I own a 1985 735i. Throughout the years my family has owned a 2002, a 320i, and now the 735i. I may not be the guru of all knowledge concerning BMWs, but I have a little more insight than the average guy. Don't ask me why I have fallen prey to the BMW bug. I am just a sucker for German engineering efficiency, I guess. Well, I was until I bought the 735.

 The 7 series is/was the flagship of the BMW models. For any type of highway driving (even a short 3 mile jaunt), there is not a car around (except maybe a Bentley or a Rolls Royce) that can compare to the BMW 7 series. It is as comfortable as a car can be. You feel as though you are literally floating down the road. And yet at the same time, the 7 series allows a sense of confidence for the driver through the incredible handling charateristics. You honestly feel like you are behind the wheel of a sports car. With a low center of gravity and wide stance, the car just shrugs when you ask it to whip around an on-ramp at 80 mph. Until you experience the feeling of driving a car of this caliber, no description can accurately describe it for you.

 But that's where the buck stops. There are so many other deficiencies with the 735i model, that it takes all of the fun or glory out of owning this car. The list is almost too long to detail here, so I will pare it down to a few of the most aggravating points.

 First of all, perhaps the most annoying factor are the wheels and tires. Now, how on earth can wheels and tires be something that causes the most resentment over this car? Easy. BMW, in their infinite wisdom, decided that they would change over to a new "standard" for their wheels and tires. Instead of equipping the car with a 15 inch or a 16 inch wheel, they went with a metric set of rims. Never heard of metric wheels? Well, it's no suprise. They did away with them within three years. But if you own a car that has the metric wheels and tires, you are stuck. Only two tire companies make the metirc sized tires (Michelin and Avon). And if you can find a set of tires for under $1000, you are lucky. Michelin replentishes their metric tire supply every 4 or 5 years. It is nearly impossible to find a set. And even if you do, as soon as they wear out, you are back in the same boat that you were in earlier. Your only option here is to purchase a set standard sized rims and tires. So now that great deal on your 7 series isn't looking so hot, is it?

 Let's move on... I have gone through 2 transmissions. Now, I admit, my ex-wife drove like Mario Andretti, but I am a "grandpa". I am the guy who is plodding along at 55 on the freeway while you are zipping through traffic at 70. I'm the guy who you honk at and wave your fist at while you are trying to weave through the other cars. (Just wait til I really get old - I'll be even slower!!!) Anyway, my style of driving is not the type that eats transmission up. I pamper my car when I drive it. And yet, my 735 has repaid me with the price of two transmissions. If you are under the impression that a trip down to the local Certified Transmission shop is the answer, forget it. They won't touch the car. In fact, short of the BMW dealer, no one would touch it. And in a city the size of Omaha, Nebraska, that ought to give you an idea as to the reputation of these transmissions. I finally found a place down in Texas (IN TEXAS!!!) that sent out a used transmission. What a pain in the butt!

 A few of the other problems that seem to infect the 735i models are;

** Terrible heater control units (the heater won't turn off and the controls break easily)

** Parts are hard to find and only specialty mechanics will accept the car for maintenance.

** Cheap electronics (the Oil Service lights cannot be reset because the nicad batteries were soldered onto the dash panel - thus requiring the replacement of the entire instrument cluster!)

** Power to weight ratio is very poor (the 735 is a very heavy car and the 3.5 liter engine is an inline 6 cylinder). This translates into horrible acceleration.

 And the list goes on and on....

 So why have I kept the car? Well, to be honest, part of it is a status thing. I am not crazy about the car, but others seem to be. Okay, so it's an ego thing. Another reason is that it isn't rusty. 90% of the cars in Omaha are "rust buckets". The city of Omaha can't help but salt the living daylights out of the roads during winter. My BMW came from California and has been spared that fate so far. The final reason is that I only paid $2000 for it 6 years ago and for the money, it would be hard to replace it.

 But if I had it to do it all over again, I would have walked right by the car and not even taken a second glance. Handling and prestige are two nice things to have in a car, but they certainly don't make up for the shear amount of other problems that plague the 735i models.

 So if you have a choice between an 1985 BMW 735i and, let's say, a 1986 Ford Tempo... go with the Tempo. You'll look like you are diving a big jelly bean of a car, but at least you will be content. Sadly, with the 735, that won't be the case.
