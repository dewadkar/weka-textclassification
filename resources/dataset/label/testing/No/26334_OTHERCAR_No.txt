            My 1997 Chevy Astro van is the second one I have owned. I just love the look of the van and the fact that it is so roomy. My three kids say it is very comfy, even for the 6 feet 2 inch one. I also have a baby who is in a car seat and it is very easy to place him in his seat on the middle bench seat. Lots of room for sports equipment, toys and stroller. 
I have very bad back problems and the drivers seat gives me no problems at all.
The downside to this van is just like the last one I owned which was a 1995. I bought this one brand new and at about 15,000 it started making this awful clunking noise coming from the transmission. It shifted extremely hard from first to second. 
I started taking it in under warranty and several times they said they could not &quot;Duplicate the noise&quot;. Finally my family went on a 400 mile trip out of town and when we arrived about ten miles away from our home it started &quot;clunking&quot;. It was so bad that it just about threw us through the front windshield and the baby was crying was it lunging so bad. I was angry and drove it straight to the dealer.
 It was now past it's 36,000 mile warranty but had already been in the shop 4 times for this same problem. When they saw my husbands face they sent out their top transmission guy who hooked up a monitor to the computer then drove it out of the lot with my husband in the passenger seat. It did not even make it out of the parking lot and his meter went nuts and I saw the thing lunge forward and make a loud &quot;Clunk&quot;. Finally after driving this thing 38,000 miserable miles they said &quot;It definitely needs a new transmission&quot;. Each time it goes into Chevy they NEVER give us a rental and the service area is awful.
The next problem is that it now has 42,000 miles on it and is getting ready for it's third set of tires. They wear very uneven and it is starting to have transmission problems again. The breaks have also been replaced three times and they squeak very badly. I had many of these same problems with my first Astro van but thought maybe I just had gotten a lemon.
 The price of the van is the best for the size, power and comfort of the van. Till Chevy fixes it's transmission problems, tire problems and the rattling problems with the passenger side window.....I would not ever buy another one and do not recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
