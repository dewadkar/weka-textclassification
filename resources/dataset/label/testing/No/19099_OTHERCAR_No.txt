            At the time I bought a Kia Sportage I owned a larger SUV which had a lot of mileage and I felt it was time to trade. My family had grown to adulthood and we did not need a large car any longer. My husband and I lived alone, yet desired an SUV type of automobile.
I loved the fact that it had good gas mileage and its lovely gold color. I also liked the easy way of getting in and out of it. I hated the ride; it was bumpy.
Once the ride was over I ached all over.
Anyone who purchases a Kia Sportage should beware of the safety precaution associated with driving an SUV. A Kia will make a good car for a responsible teenager because of the good gas mileage and the inexpensive price.<br><br>
