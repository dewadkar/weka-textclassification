            We purchased a new <b>Saturn SL2</b> in 1996, it was our first new family car. The first thing we noticed in the showroom was that they were not pushy, it was clean, and information was everywhere. We quickly were given a welcome and we test drove our <b>SL2</b> a few moments later. My husband liked it a lot and the price was in our range. Noticing our toddler, our salesperson showed us the opened side of the <b>SL2</b> showing the side impact beam stressing the vehicle�s safety features. 

As we considered our purchase, the sales staff was quite cordial, providing toys for our child and not hovering over us. We needed a second vehicle immediately and decided this no haggle approach was the least stressful way to go. Our car purchasing experience was limited to used cars, good old duds from those awful lots. We were used to dishonest and pressure filled sales pitches, this was refreshing.

We read the literature, asked questions  and were quite satisfied with the answers. We didn't even try any other dealers, we decided we wanted a <b>Saturn</b>, the car was attractive, highly rated, seemed to be safer than others in its class and the price was right. 

We were on a budget with less than stellar credit, we had never had a loan of any sort either and were a bit nervous anticipating finance issues. Between our nerves and an active toddler with a runny nose, we figured dealing with this would be difficult. Fortunately, they were patient and helpful whether waiting as my husband and I chased after our tot or providing a tissue for the baby. To our surprise, the process was smooth and we took delivery a few days later...

<b>Is this a sign?</b>

When we arrived to pick up our <b>Saturn</b> there was such fanfare. There was a �Saturn Cheer� and family photo with the car. We immediately took the carseat from the �old car� to install in the new car. My husband was unable to install the seat as tight as it should have been. I tried and failed. Our saleswoman tried, another salesperson tried. Everyone tried...We could not get a good fit in the <b>Saturn</b>. I was <i>not</i> a happy camper. No one seemed to know what to do. Guess I should have seen the signs...

The problem was solved by adding a tether strap which <b>Saturn</b> did install for us. The problem was that <b>Saturn</b> did not seem aware of this solution, we had to suggest it. It was done days later, I returned the carseat to the �old car� where the fit was fine until we asked for the tether.

We�ve had difficulties with other car seats as well.

<b>Another sign...</b>

When your car has a bumper-to-bumper warranty and the <i>bumper</i> slips out of place, you can count on the dealer to fix this, right?

WRONG! While not a huge deal, we were shocked that the bumper-to-bumper warranty <i>did not include the bumper</i>. This was a defect, not the result of an accident. Each time we questioned it, we got another excuse as to why the bumper did this. It was never fixed. This does not affect the performance, but the whole idea of a bumper-to-bumper warranty that excluded the bumper?

<b>For the first four years...</b>

 The car had no major problems, aside from the damn bumpers. The rear bumper�s paint peeled off in a few spots within a few months. We were accident free, they insisted that we caused the peeling somehow...The peeling does not appear to be from being hit, it just happened. I do believe it was something we could not have done.

The few times the engine light went on or something seemed wrong, we were pretty much satisfied with the service we received. Most problems were minor and required minutes to fix, all under warranty. Then the warranty expired...It�s a good thing we purchased an extended warranty.

<b>Car trouble</b>

This week the car made an odd noise at startup. My engine light went on, so I took it in for service at a nearby dealer. The service staff asked whether or not I had an extended warranty and I nodded. They asked what the deductible was and I said I wasn�t sure and grabbed my cellphone to call my husband. Before I could ask my husband, the man snapped that most people know exactly what they have and that he�d <i>have</i> to look it up. It took an hour and a half just to have them tell me what was wrong. Each time I checked, there were no customers ahead of me and the mechanics were standing around.

I finally was informed as to what was causing my car trouble. Several of the problems he mentioned quickly. I know nothing about cars mind you, but he explained since they had been the last to service the car that they �took care of it.� He then gave me an estimate, thankfully my deductible was only 100.00. The car was fixed rather quickly, but I will be returning next week as the steering is now off.
 
<b>The good, the bad and the freaky</b>

The car made it on a number of car trips, including a 2400 mile round trip journey without leaving us stranded  with car trouble. It gets excellent gas mileage and the <b>ABS</b> have been an asset along with the traction control. I�ve never had an accident, the car performs very well during our crazy Chicago winters. I personally have found the car pleasurable to drive most of the time.

This car was purchased for my use, I�m fairly small. My husband is much taller and finds the car too small and uncomfortable for extended car rides. Now that we have two children, our older daughter can only sit behind me, as my husband needs the seat far back, so far the backseat passenger has no leg room. The car is not at all roomy, the trunk is tiny and we�ve had difficulty with many different car seats, we�ve tried quite a few. 

The <b>Saturn</b> advertises how it won�t dent even showing commercials where the car is pelted with golf balls and even a baseball (or was it a softball?) or two. Let me tell you that even mild hail will leave some damage. I find it hard to believe the <b>Saturn</b> can withstand being pelted at the golf course but is covered with small craters after a mild hailstorm. Between this and the paint issues, I�m disappointed.

Earlier, I mentioned the �Saturn Cheer� which I found freaky. When <b>Saturn</b> first started advertising their �different kind of company� on television, folks joked about a <i>Saturn Cult</i>. I don�t think their is a cult out there, but I have been invited to a few �Saturn Barbecues� and to join the �Saturn Car Club� a few times. My parents have owned <b>Fords, Chevrolets and Chryslers</b> but never got a cheer or an invite.....

<b>Overall</b>

There was a time I thought I�d buy another <b>Saturn</b>. That time has passed. The performance has been satisfactory, but the negative experiences have overshadowed this. As my children grow and larger vehicles gain popularity, I am sure my next vehicle will NOT be a <b>Saturn</b>.  I can�t say I don�t recommend the <b>Saturn</b> overall, but the <b>1996 SL2</b>, a four door sedan that looked terrific at first has disappointed me as time goes on.

We�ve taken good care of our car, but I can�t recommend purchasing this vehicle used at this point. Assuming other previously owned <b>Saturns</b> may or may not have been as well maintained, I would not purchase this model again. I�m not confident that it will perform well much longer.

If you are purchasing a new <b>Saturn</b>, you might enjoy the haggle free sale, but please double check your warranty to avoid surprises (ask if the bumper-to-bumper warranty still excludes the bumper for one!).
I�d suggest trying your carseat in the car before signing on the dotted line and taking several test drives, consider who else may be driving.

I loved my <b>Saturn</b> at one time, its true...But I�ve lost that lovin� feeling....
