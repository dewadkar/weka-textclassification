            I primarily use this camera for work to track progress on a construction site.  I like it because it is sturdy and seems to hold up well in conditions like those I use it in.  

The particular aspect of this piece of equipment that I would like to hit on is the night shot function.  There are two settings, "moon" and "moon plus" which basically open the apeture of the lens long enough for you to capture most images in very low light conditions.  This is very useful and I have used it quite often with success.  I will however point out a couple of drawbacks.  First, the "moon" setting is barely any better than just snapping the photo like you would normally, to get any help with the low light conditions, you really need to switch it to "moon plus".  Second, it is very difficult to get a clear picture while using this function.  Any movement is captured by the extended apature opening time from moving people to the movement of your hand holding the camera.  The best way to do it is to go ahead and take the time to set up a tripod and minimize the problem.  

That being said, everything else on the camera is to be expected, easy to use, adequate zoom, many useful functions.  Battery life is not bad and really depend on how much you view your photos before taking the disk out.  I will also point out that the battery is upgradeable of course for a hefty price of a extended life battery.  

The photos are recorded onto a floppy disk, which I have mixed feelings about.  First, the disks have limited space especially if you have it set on a high resolution.  Also, there are many other ways out there such as mini-CD's and memory cards that can store more photos and don't take up so much space on the camera.  On the other hand, every computer has a floppy drive and it is very easy to just pop it in and work from the disk.  On a final note I will say that the camera seems to be a little bulky for my taste.
