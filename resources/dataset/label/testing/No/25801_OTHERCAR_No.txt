<TEXT>
            I am the former owner of a Mazda 626. I purchased the car because I thought it was a good deal for the money. I was impressed by it's spacious inside. But then after two months things started to go bad. everything went wrong. First the seals on the windows were not put on properly so I constantly had this whistle sound in the car unless it was at a stand still. Then after they were replaced they never stayed in place so I was at the shop more than I was on the road. Then came the summer all of the molding  just melted off and slid right down the car. Then it got worse from that point. I kept up with all scheduled up keep and had an extended warranty. But the car just was way more trouble than it was worth. I would have rather spent a little more and spent less time in the shop and more enjoying my new ride.<br><br>
