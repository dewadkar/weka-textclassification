            The image quality of this camera is great, and that was my primary reason for choosing it, as 3.3M Pixels was about as good as you could get, and the lens is of good quality. Also when I first took delivery of the camera, and read the instruction book, I was stunned by the extensive functionality of the camera. However using the camera is a different story:
1) Battery life is very short, which would be OK if there was a battery pack and charger in the standard package, but there is not, and I resent having to buy one, having already paid a lot for the camera (and knowing that other cameras do include this).
2) The software included with the camera is as minimal as could be - I only use the software for transferring images from the camera to my Mac, and even that is not easy. It came with a selection of other freeware that I resent having loaded onto the computer as it was so amateur. If you do not already have it, get Adobe Photoshop LE - it is free with almost any piece of USD 100 hardware, but of course not with this camera.
3) As I have said, the functionality is great, but I hardly use any of it, as it is so difficult to access. The menu driven system is clumsy and non-intuitive, and even basic things like setting up the camera so that the LCD display does not come on automatically (to save battery) is impossible.
With a bit more care, this camera could have been great, but a lack of attention to detail leaves it badly flawed - however the pictures on automatic setting are easy to take and excellent! If your reason for choosing this over and above another camera of similar image quality is the functionality, forget it - it is too difficult to use the advanced functionality.
