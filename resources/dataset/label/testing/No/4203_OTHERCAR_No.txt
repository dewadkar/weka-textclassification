            Our Dodge Grand Caravan is a 1996 and it is the BIGGEST lemon I have ever had the displeasure of driving.  DO NOT BUY a 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan.  Ever.  I've compared notes with three other people who have them and theirs are lemons too.

My goodness, where to start!  There are so many problems.  Okay, here are the biggest problems we had BEFORE the 3 year warranty was up:

Transmission went totally out, we were stranded in Tulsa, had to spend a 
bunch on a rental car even though repairs were paid for.

Power steering would just completely go out when we went through a puddle.  Not fun in a huge, heavy van!  Took it in THREE times and they never fixed it.  Said &quot;it just happens sometimes&quot; as if this was just something we had to accept.  Finally when the transmission went out in Tulsa their technicians knew how to fix it.

Multiple other parts failures -- just about everything.  Several pumps of various kinds, something else involving the axles and lubrication, the radio antennae, aside from the crappy drink holder and other minor irritations.

I hate this van.  I will never buy another Dodge.<br><br>
