            I have a 99 GL with an automatic and a ton of problems.  The first year that I had the car I was in love with it and never had anything go wrong.  The first thing that I noticed wrong was that the seats that were supposed to be scotch guarded stained with bottled water being spilled on them, then try and get the stain out, the spot just gets bigger and bigger and your seats look like they are 10 years old and an old man with urinary problems has been driving it.  Then, the first winter came, the car won't start in cold weather very well, and in Denver, the weather really isn't that cold.  Then at about 26k miles, my battery decided that it was going to die, really great to have happen after a day long track meet when all you want to do is go out for food and sleep.  

But that was only the start; (this is a long list by the way) the middle seat belt in the back only works when it wants to, the hub cap on my alloy wheels fall off quite often, my fog light covers are gone (I found them laying in front of the car about 5 times before and now they are just AWOL), the automatic transmission doesn't like to go from R to D very quickly and causes you to roll for a while, the black paint on the vents is peeling/chipping off (and its not like I am hard on my car), the car goes through a quart of oil every 1000 miles, I had to replace an O2 sensor at 33,000 miles, the 6 disc changer (that was supposed to be the best on the market ) skips all the time and works only about half the time when it is cold, there are rattles in the dash, the A-pillar, and the doors, the suspension squeaks over every bump along with the thuds that come from the front wheels, I already have sun damage to my dash (and the car has a garage to be in), the MPG is not what they say it is (avg. 18 in town, which is now Lincoln, Ne), and so on and so on...

Over all, this car is not worth the trouble, it looks good, but is in the shop a lot... so not too many people get to see me in my car.  Not a good deal for the money... my suggestion is an Acura Integra, a number of my friends have late model ones that run just as good as the the new RSX that my girl friend just got.

To all those who are so far impressed with the Jetta... just wait... it will come to you soon enough.  Sorry.
