            Ok, I'm a little biased because I was sucked into buying this car because it was all I could afford on short notice.  I had a Celica which was on it's last leg (I loved that car) and I needed something fast.  The Grand Am LOOKED sporty and fun.  Looks can be deceving.  

Lets see... it handles like a shopping cart.  That is after we bought expensive tires, before it handled like a shopping cart with a broken wheel!  It has these really annoying rattles that sound like some chipmunks are partying in the dashboard.  The soon brought the party into the doors, too.  Now it's like a chipmunk parade all through the car!

Apparently there is a steering knuckle..I wouldn't have known except it broke while we were doing 65 and would probably have killed us if the road wasn't deserted!  It gave no warning, it just went.  It was a nightmare.  
The seats (we have the 2 door) seem convienent because they don't lock which makes it easy to get in and out of the back.  Well convience is a safety hazard.  If you are sitting in the back and someone slams on the breaks, you can go through the windshield.  My dog almost did!

Oh, did I mention the floors in the front are kind of curved so that it is VERY uncomfortable to drive or ride in for more than 10 minutes. I have ankle problems as it is, but everyone who rides in the car complains about it too.
