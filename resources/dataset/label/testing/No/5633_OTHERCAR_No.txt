            Bought Vibe GT in Oct 2002.  In Sept after 25,000 miles the clutch went out and the entire assembly had to replaced.  Pontiac would not and did not cover it. Cost $986.00.  The clutch plate is TINY, no wonder it wore out.

The body is like plastic and with little pressure you can push in and out on the fenders.  All interior trim is plastic and breaks/wears out rapidly and is easily marred.

The six speed is useless as you attain highway speed in 4th gear and 5th & 6th have no power at all.  You must downshift to 4th if you want to pass anyone.

The seat comfort level is about a 3 or 4 on a scale of 10.
This car is way overpriced vs the quality you receive.

The 110 outlet is good for nothing more than charging your cell phone, you could do that from the cig lighter.

If you get the navigation system (awesome) you give up stereo (yuck) quality big time. No choice about this.

The Hi performance tires have worn out after 30,000 miles -alignment good, no burn outs, no racing -- dealer price to replace  $1100.00 (Dunlop - sport 9000, 17in wheels.

The warranty is 36,000 (it needs 60,000) but the clutch is only 12,000 or 1 year ( because Pontiac knows it will wear out.
