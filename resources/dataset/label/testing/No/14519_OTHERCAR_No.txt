            Driving a Toyota RAV 4 it's definitely not a driver's dream nor his nightmare.I Live in a mountain area were the winter brings a lot of snow,for that reason sometimes I have to live my front wheel drive sedan parked and get in my wife's RAV 4.The best think about this car is its ability to keep going no matter what,besides its highly reliable engine(we only take it to the shop for the regular servicing)this car drives great in the snow,if you ever feel like adventuring off the snow plowed roads you can do it without living with the fear of getting stuck.What I think makes it great in the snow is the high off the ground base ,the center differential that can be activated if you need extra traction,the full time AWD.For being as tall and  not very wide  the RAV 4 is cornering great thanks to its relatively stiff suspension.
The interior is somehow ..rugged, living the impression that you're inside a box,the dash board with its easy to read instruments  alleviate a bit that feeling.The A/C on/off levers are noisy and completely out of style,on the other hand all the other commands(lights,windshield wipers)are easy to use.
The car is an UNDERACHIEVER though,2.0 L,4 in line ,120 HP engine is a way to small engine for such a car,the car is too big and too heavy to heave only that under the hood,not to mention the noise it generates at all speeds .
Driving the car up the mountain is where the small engine gets you,you can get 55 mph in the 4th gear,shifting down to 3rd gear gets you going over 60 mph with a cost though,the tachometer goes way over 4000 rpm which makes the engine cry.The only way to get up the mountain is let others pass you and take it slow.The same underpowered engine needs a lot of time to get 60 mph on a flat road.
So overall I think this car it's not a good buy for everyone,a V6 engine would be the solution for a better car.
