              I have been looking for a truck and on December 3, 1999 I made my decision to purchase a Dodge Dakota SLT 2000 regular cab.  I am very, very pleased with it, especially with the color which is a patriot blue pearl.  If you haven't seen it, check it out!    I decided on the option of the V-6 magnum engine; just the power I need.  It's the best performance I've ever seen in a small truck.    The cruise control is a must; I love it.  My brother lives 70 miles north in Jacksonville, Fl. and I take I-95.  You set the control and it's like automatic pilot, it's so comfortable you just don't want to get out of the truck!    I was impressed to find, being the big guy that I am (well not that big!!!), that the seats are very comfortable. I would give this truck a Five Star Rating and recommend it to any of my friends.<br><br>
