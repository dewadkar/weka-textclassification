            I have a '90 Mercury Topaz and overall its an okay car.  The size of it is awful.  I'm only 5'7 and I have a hard time getting in and out without hitting my head on the roof or door way.  If you are sitting in back there is barely any leg room, especially if you are behind the driver and they are tall.  If you have a younger child or baby that needs to be in a car seat like I do you should try out the carseat in the car before buying it to make sure it fits.  The infant carrier type seat fit if you angled it just right.  But the bigger front/rear facing ones do not fit in rear facing unless you have a very small driver so the front seats can be pushed up farther.  I have not owned this car for the past 11 years, just the past year or two.  From what I was told not much has been replaced on the car.  The body has held up well.  There is really no dents or bad scratches (though we do have a diffrent front bumper and left fender because it has been through a car accident, but those were the only things that needed fixed.  The body delt well with the impact.) We have recently had to fix the transmission but that was more because of the way a driver had been driving it.  It is a stickshift and the driver was learning and he wasn't doing to well with it.  It has automatic shoulder belts and I HATE them!!! I will never buy a car with automatic shoulder belts again.  Over all the performance is good but size is bad.
