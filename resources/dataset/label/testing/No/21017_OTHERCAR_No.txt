            Before you purchase this vehicle, there are some things you should know. I purchased a RAV4L in May of 1999. I am very sorry that I didn't research this SUV more thoroughly. One of the most important things to consider is this vehicle is loved by auto thieves so insurance for the RAV4 is at a premium. Having had a small fender bender in this SUV I now know it is one of the more expensive cars to repair.  The car handles well but is not designed for comfort. There is almost no leg room in the back seat. Even the kids complain about it. The back seats recline, however, it is very difficult to operate this feature. There is almost no storage space. One thing I would like to say in defense of this car is the Toyota service departments have been better than any other service department I have had experience with. <br><br>
