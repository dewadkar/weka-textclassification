            To me, this small 2-door coupe looks just a little awkward, as if the designers couldn't decide between the ultra-slick shape of a contemporary Ferrari, or the bland-as-bullocks lines of a more pedestrian Toyota Camry. Probably the best design feature is the front-end, with a nicely shaped and integrated front skirt.  The headlights also make a tasteful contribution to the wedgy front end, and are much nicer looking that for example the Nissan 300ZX's ugly headlight design.

Sadly, the styling loses more and more originality as you move backwards. The doors could be off just about any mass-produced Japanese sedan, and the rear-end hatch styling is quite boxy, almost reminiscent of an early Lada.  3 stars.<br><br>
