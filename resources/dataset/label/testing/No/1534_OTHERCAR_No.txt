            I love my Saturn -1996 SL2, but after about 3 years and only 30,000 miles I have had to replace the top motor mount and the front brakes twice now. At my expense, as this was not a covered item under original or extended warranty. I am told this is common service. Since this is my first new car, I have no basis for comparison. Two years ago I would have absolutely said yes to buying another Saturn, now I probably would not.Originally I purchased because it had such great reviews on being reliable<br>and the dent resistant panels- which I still love! I don't have to worry about cars in parking lots dinging me.<br><br><br><br>
