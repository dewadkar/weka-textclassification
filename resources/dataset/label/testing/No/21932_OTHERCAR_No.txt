            We own this car one year now and everyone is very satisfied with that car.
A quiet and strong engine, stays for safety in every situation.
You can choice between automatic and non-automatic gear. 
The communication and entertaining equipment is very good too, 
navigation-system and cd-player that u can control by keys, voice or steering-wheel.
But the mobil-phone could be more comfortable to use.

Its a good car even u have a family, its big, comfortable and nice.
If u have kids, u will wonder how much they fall asleep on back-seat cos the
car is so quiet and comfortable.
They offer the car in different kewl colours for every taste one!!
