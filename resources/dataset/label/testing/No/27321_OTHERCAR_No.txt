            We bought a 2000 Durango in 2001. I like it overall, nice looks, nice drive. However, there are several things bad about it which is why I wouldnt buy it again,

Price - WAY over priced, you'd be lucky to get one in the low 20s. Yeah its a 4X4 but you dont get much else, just a standard small SUV inside.

Room - Very limited cargo room in side if your a family of 4-5. The front seats are comfortable but forget the back, especially the souped up back seat which is thrown in. We are a family of 5 and there is no room for luggage.

Mechanical - There is a loud rattling sound that commonly appears under the vehicle that no mechanic, Dodge or elsewhere can locate. It is very irritating. The vehicle also hesitates on cruise control and the gas mileage is very bad. My kids yell "umm hungry" everytime the low fuel alarm goes off. The vehicle has very good acceleration. No problem of Dodge but the Wrangler tires keep going bad with bubbles appearing in the wall.

Overall - Great for camping but dont make it your primary family vehicle.
