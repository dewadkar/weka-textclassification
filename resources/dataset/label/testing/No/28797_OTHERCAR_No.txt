            We purchased a 1998 Luminia last year.  It was the worst mistake we could have made!  The rear door panel came loose not once but twice!  The trunk got jammed and wouldn't open (that's three trips to the dealer in less than 6 months)  The fan motor has a rattle (sometimes) , and the brakes constantly need replacing.  All of these I might could live with but the car also has a lot of excess static electricity so that whenever I get out of the car the first metal object I touch gives me a real jolt!! The car does drive good and I like the size of it but I think I could find these two &quot;good points&quot; in a more dependable vehicle.  This is just my opinion but I have a friend that had the same model and she had the same problems with hers.<br><br>
