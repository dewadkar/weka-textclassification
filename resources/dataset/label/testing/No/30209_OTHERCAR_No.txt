            As a user and owner of Isuzu pickups since 1995,I have had the opportunity
to experience the good and bad points of this little truck. I have found
it to be reasonably comfortable and dependable,as well as capable of handling moderate loads when the need arises. On the down side,problems
with air-conditioning,a burnt valve due to improper adjustment at the
factory,defects with exhaust system,and a leaking seal are detractors
from an otherwise great little truck. Overall I have enjoyed the ownership
experience and wish I had the opportunity to buy another,another that is
made by Isuzu.
Unfortunately,I traded my great little truck for the newer version,the Hombre. Since that time I have had nothing but problems.So much so that
I ended up trading the Hombre for a Ford Ranger.Taking a loss in the deal.
 I feel that what ever the reason Isuzu discontinued the manufacture
of their pickup,using the GM S-10 version hombre was certainly not the
best route to take.I'm sure that there are some consumers that have had
a more positive experience with the Hombre. But I, having had such a bad
experience with mine,can certainly not recommend it to anyone else.
