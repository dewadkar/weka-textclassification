            Let me inform you on something.  If you are going to buy in SUV soon, make sure that you don't buy the Mercedes Benz M Class.  It is one of the worst cars that I have ever owned.  There are a couple of good things about this car though.
The ML 430 is what kind of car i have bought, and the seats are very comfortable and roomy.  This SUV has a special Mercedes Benz power assist that if one wheel begins to slip or is stuck in the mud, the car's computer will apply most of the power to that wheel so that it can get out of the mud.  This feature also makes it almost impossible to skid your car.  
Another good feature that this car has is a very nice optional Bose stereo.  Now we all know that the stereo does not make a difference to everyone, but it is a nice one.  
I have bought this vehicle because I had done some research on the internet and I decided to go and test drive it.  It had nice handling and I got a pretty good deal on it so I decided to buy.  Ever since then, all I have had is problems.  The light behind the odometer was not lighting up, so I decided to send it in to get it fixed.  When I got it back and I was driving the next morning, my ML 430 had almost exploded.  I was sitting in my car driving and I began to smell a gas smell.  I then pulled over to see if everything was alright.  When I got out, I still had left the car running, and of course, gas was leaking out the main pipeline from the fuel tank to the engine.  I turned off my car and had to wait for a tow truck to come and pick me up.
Now one may consider this to be bad workmanship from the dealer I bought it from, but I just wanted to say because that proves that the Mercedes Benz employees really don't care about there customers that just bought a 50,000 dollar car from them.
The vehicle though has a nice, but loud drive, because it is an SUV and not a car.  My opinion is that if you are looking for luxury you should go for this car, but if you want a reliable car, definitely do NOT buy this car.<br><br>
