              In 1995, my girlfriend bought a new Neon. In its early days, it was still being classed as Plymouth, instead of a Dodge. The car was &quot;cute&quot;, I guess one one could say, kinda reminded me of a frog. Initially, we were pretty happy with the car, it got pretty decent mileage, and had a pretty good factory stereo. It handled rather well. 

   There was also a major problem with the brakes squealing. Despite brake pad replacement on 3 occasions, and front brake rotor replacement once, the brakes continued to squeak. The dealer finally lied and told us that the squeak was just part of the brake pad for the car, and there was nothing more they could do.
 
   We had the car for 6 weeks, when a woman ran a stop sign and T-boned us in the driver's side. She was travelling about 50 miles per hour, and the impact knocked us across 4 lanes of traffic. The entire left side of the car was demolished, but insurance said it was not a total loss. The car went to the body shop with $9,850 in damages. 6 months later, we finally got the car back. The problems we experienced after the wreck were unreal. The &quot;check engine&quot; light came on and went off constantly. A computer diagnostics test said there was absolutely nothing wrong with the car. The engine would over-rev, and the transmission seemed to slip, there was a severe loss of power, but every time we took it in, the shop could find nothing wrong. 

  We lived in a pretty high crime area, and the car was stolen. Whoever took it must have really been mad about stealing such a lemon, and took it out to the country and torched it. The police found it 4 days later, burned beyond recognition.

  The only really good aspect of this car, was the steel impact rails in the doors. That little car took one hell of a hit, and 3 people walked away from a potentially fatal crash, without a scratch.<br><br>
