            The Jimmy is a well-thought-out vehicle that is roomy yet not too big. I don't understand the trend to make this model larger. My 1996 Jimmy rode comfortably and was a pleasure to drive, but other than that it was an annoyance. I drove it mostly locally but did take it on one long trip. It was not only expensive at the pump, but was expensive for maintenance. Among the things that broke were a grease boot, the 4WD switch, a couple of batteries quite early, the coolant (burned up), the seatbelt spring, and finally, the AC. The latter would have cost $1150 to fix, so that's when I sold the vehicle.
The Jimmy is unnecessarily heavy, resulting in poor mileage and brakes and other things wearing out early. Changing a tire is very difficult, too. It was ahead of its competition in 1996 but I am now happier with a 2001 station wagon that gets 26 MPG.
I used my Jimmy to haul bikes and a rooftop container, to haul goods occasionally, and to haul recyclables numerous times. Unless you <b>need</b> such a vehicle don't buy one.
