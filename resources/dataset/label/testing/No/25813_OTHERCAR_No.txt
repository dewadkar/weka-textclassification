            I bought this car used out of necessity.  What I like about the Suzuki is the reliability. It's easy to handle including bad weather (i.e. snow, ice).  I buy a huge bag of cat litter to weigh down the back to get good traction.  

The biggest complaint I have is last year at 68,000 miles I had to have my transmission replaced.  There isn't much pick up so exiting out into heavy traffic is a bit tricky.

Like I said previously it's easy to handle.  No problem with tight parking spaces and once out on the highway the drive is nice.  The car does not keep out traffic noises and the front seats are ok but the back is cramped.
