            My 1996 Plymouth Neon was the first vehicle I bought out of college.  I purchase the vehicle new, co-signed with my father in the Chicago area, and drove it down to Dallas, Texas to room with my friend and look for a job.  All appeared to be good in the world.

But the Neon would not have it that way.  The first thing I noticed, while driving the Neon down to Dallas (900 miles) was that the Neon rattled at anything above 70 mph.  Being a 3 speed automatic, it also seemed to be red-lining most of the trip.  Not a good sign.

The seats were economical, as you'd expect.  No surprise, get what you pay for.  The trunk was a decent size.  The back seats weren't too bad, but not really good enough for adults.

The Neon would typically get about 25 miles per gallon for me in mixed suburban driving.

All normal required maintenance was done for 25,000 miles, but the rattling got consistently worse, like all of the apples were being shaken off the tree.  After about two years, I sold the Neon, and didn't miss it for a second.

Problems I had with it?  Well, thermostat issues, for one.  I'd be driving along on a warm Dallas evening, and all of a sudden the needle on the temperature gauge would be tickling the red zone and beeping.  Then, given another minute, would fly back down to the floor.  Didn't manage to get that resolved before selling the vehicle in April of 1998.

My overall opinion?  Kids that want to spend $12000 on a car should buy a used Civic or Corolla, or save another $3000 and buy a new Civic.  It just makes more sense.  My fiancee has a 1996 Civic, and it's a dream, even at 58,000 miles.
