            I bought this car on July 27th 1999 with 23k miles. When I test drove the car, everything seemed fine, had it inspected by my mechanic and everything. After the paperwork was done and the keys were in my hand, the powered moonroof motor went, was stuck open and had rain come into the car. Brought it back to the dealership (keep in mind i only had the car less than a day and a half). They sent the car out to Allentown Pa. (hour away from my home) for a whole MONTH, i was given a Chevy Corsica as a loaner. 4 months after that, my exhaust would grumble and hit against the heat shield during heavy rain storms and driving through deep puddles, mechanics never found out what the problem was until I read the FAQ at www.neons.org (they helped me out a lot). 2 months after the exhaust incident first occured, my steering failed during a rain storm, and I almost steered right into another car head on during a sharp turn, that was repaired at my expense by my personal mechanic (belts were faulty, dealership had to wait a week to get the special tool in to do the job, my mechanic had it on hand). The next issue: trunk leaks. Water was coming in through the right tail light and the trunk lid. Dealer readjusted the trunk lid and installed an updated gasket for the light. Recently at 53k miles, my good friend had noticed my car had an oil leak, being he is a neon owner, he figured it was either the main seal, or the head gaskets because of the Neon's reputation for these failures. (Daimler Chrysler extender warranty coverage for the headgaskets to 5 years, not sure about the mileage, DC will either pay for some of the work past warranty coverage, and in some cases, pay for all of it depending on your car's mileage and age.) 

The first generation Dodge/Plymouth/Chrysler Neons have a reputation for being one of the worst cars on the road for their mechanical flaws. My car was recalled for both airbags. Apparently they can go off at random. Just imagine your with a loved one, enjoying a Sunday drive on a beautiful, scenic road, the moonroof's open, breeze on your faces, holding each other's hands, when all of a sudden both airbags come at you at over 200 mph, you drive into a pole and its curtains for both of you. Doesn't sound like the kind of entertainment I'm looking for. 

Despite all the negative comments and complaints from Neon owners, people seem to rush and buy these death traps. For these people, all I can recommend is that you buy an extended warranty (I purchased a GM warranty through my dealership, 60,000 miles for less that $400.00, it already paid for itself). Another misconception about used automobiles is that if they have low mileage, then the car is decent, should provide years of trouble free use, and it's worth it to pay more money for a car that hasn't had much use. The Neon has proven this myth false. I made the mistake of over paying for my car, only to find out later on that the trade in value is half of what i paid for the car. I thought I was getting the bigger end of the stick, when I really got shafted, not by my dealership, but by Daimler Chrylser. 

If you are truely considering buying this car, please don't. For the price I paid for mine, you can purchase a nice 95 or 96 model year Nissan or Toyota. If you prefer American automobiles, then I have to recommend a Chevrolet Malibu, or Ford Escort. If you have a family, that's a bigger incentive NOT to buy this car. <br><br>
