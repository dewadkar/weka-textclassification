            It's a great camera.Has everything I could want.It even has a ten second timer that will let you get in the picture before its taken.Who could ask for more?Well,I'm a bit more picky than that.The flash doesn't do its job that well indoors,the pictures still come out dark.Of course the program that comes with the camera will let you edit and lighten the picture once it's in the computer,but why can't i have my pictures light in the first place?Then there's another problem.Now,I'm not a professional photographer so there's a possibility it's just me but, all my faces are coming out with awful coloring,they look almost dead.And while the clarity is perfect on objects,it just isn't good when it comes to pictures of people.Next time I'm going to get a camera that's face friendly.<br><br>
