            The 1999 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner is one of the more popular in the class of 99. The standard features are pretty cool, but nothing more than normal. The inside is roomy for a truck. The extended cab offers a bit more room. Anyone larger than a 10 year old would be cramped in the back. The air conditioner is cold and you have the option for CD or cassette.
It is not the smoothest ride ever, but it is okay. The standard wheels are hazardous to your wallet. Not only are the tires pricey, but they cause the gas hand to approach &quot;E&quot; at an extremely fast rate. Once the standard tires are worn out, opt for smaller ones. True, this is an off road vehicle, but you have to get on the road to find an off road spot. Might as well save gas while doing it. The new tires don't even have to be small ones, just go down a size or two. 
The Tacoma that I drive daily is actually my work truck. Once we equipped it with a special topper, we loaded the Toyota up with equipment all totaling about 400 pounds. The truck might have risen to the occasion if it were a manual shift transmission. It is an automatic though and it seriously lacks power. There are small Datsuns from the 1970s with more power. It is definitely good that this truck is also available in 4WD and manual shift. If not, I guess there would be a lot of unsatisfied men explaining to their wives why they had to try and move the new washer and dryer with the family car. If you want power, DO NOT BUY THIS TRUCK!!! At least, not an automatic.  <br><br>
