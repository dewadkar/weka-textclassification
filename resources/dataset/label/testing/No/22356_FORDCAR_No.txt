            Is that a truck or a tank... Its an ok car for a big family, but has no room in the trunk for anything. Its a very tiny space. Also, the gas  bill is very high because it has a really big tank to fill the gass. There are good things to the car though. It has a lot of room for the children and yourself. Another, thing is that its a high up car if u like to be high up. The bad thing is though that it is a very big car and can put smaller cars in danger if the get in an accident. Make sure you make a really good decision before you buy the car. <br><br>
