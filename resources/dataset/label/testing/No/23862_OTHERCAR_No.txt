            We've owned our 1990 Grand Caravan SE for ten years now.  We bought it when we were planning on increasing our family to six people.  We've mostly put highway/cruise control miles on it, over 200,000 of them.  It is currently asking for it's fifth transmission and will not get it.  We've liked the car in general, but a new transmission every two years is a little much.  The transmissions have all died between 60,000/70,000 miles. The tran pan was filled with metal shavings that looked like large &quot;butter curls.&quot;  We've babied each successive transmission more than the preceding one and they still go bad. By the way, Chrysler says that there is nothing wrong with their transmissions.  Funny, the transmission repair shop says they'd go bankrupt if it weren't for Chrysler transmissions. When we drive past the transmission place we look at their lot and play &quot;Count the Caravans.&quot; I wouldn't recommend the Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth minivans to anyone.<br><br>
