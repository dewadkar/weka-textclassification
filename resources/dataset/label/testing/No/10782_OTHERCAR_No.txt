                 I purchased my 1999 GMC Suburban, SLE, in April 1999.  I have wanted a Suburban for a long time.  I love the truck.  It has been great on trip.  It is comfortable for long and short trips. The only thing I have had a problem with is the brakes.  It has been to the shop 8 times.  I think now it is fixed.  It took 19,000 miles.  It needed upgrade caliphers and brake pads, with an alignment.  The gas mileage is not to good.  No SUV has good mileage. Gas mileage is averaging 16 miles to the gallon.  The extremes are 10 in the city and 19 on the highway. The room, comfort, air conditioner and the usability is great. The third seat is a must.  It can easily be folded down or removed to haul items.  The truck has good handling.  I have the barn door rear gate, there is a blind spot in the middle.  You have to learn to look around the the center part.  The rear cooling is great.  The kids can be cooled down quiet easily. I was glad I bought the Suburban and would buy another. They have many uses.  The are comfortable, easy to drive and good looking! 
Well, things have changed, 11-02-00, I am in the middle of dealing with the California Lemon Law.  It has been in the shop more than 12 times, and the brakes are a mess.  I wouldn't wish it on anyone. So run from a 1999 Suburban! <br><br>
