            I bought this car for my wife. This was a used car 1992 Lincoln Continental. Purchased in 1997 or 98. Anyway it's a Beautiful car (to the eye, But beauty is only skin deep you will find) We had this car about a month and a half when the head gasket blew. I thought well I have heard of this from time to time. Must just be one of those things. Well I don't have to leave much more here. Let me tell you this car has the 3.8L. Just check the net for problems with the 3.8L. This engine has been recalled in many Ford products (Windstar, Sable, Taurus, Etc) I will never buy a ford again. This car looks great but in my Opinion their products are junk. All I can say is do your homework. Check consumer reports. You will find this car on the &quot;Used cars to avoid list&quot; Check the network. You get the picture. This car has been a lesson for me. After the head gasket blew that's when I did my homework (To late) These cars are notorious for their problems &quot;JUST DO YOUR HOMEWORK&quot;<br><br>
