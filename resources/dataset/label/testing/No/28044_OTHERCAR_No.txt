            I bought a 2000 Plymouth Neon LX in September because of the .9% financing and it wasn't a very expensive car, only $15,000.00.  It was a standard shift and from day one it hesitated and missed through every gear.  I took it back to the shop 5 times (over 30 days total) and they fixed 3 different things on it until they finally told me that all of the standard shift Neons have that problem and it wouldn't be able to be fixed until Spring of 2000.  In November they traded me out of that car into an automatic ($16,400.00) and I thought it would be ok.  It started doing the same thing except this one started stalling and loosing power on me while driving on interstate. (VERY DANGEROUS)  I took it into the shop and they said it was a bad engine coil and engine mount and replaced them.  Picked it up and the next morning it did the same thing.  I took it back and called Chrysler Corporation to complain about all of my problems with these cars.  One hour after I called the Corporate office, the dealership called me and told me that it was bad gas.  After changing their story a few different times and telling me that my car may not burn the type of gas I use (Exxon) right, they then decided to blame it on me.  They tried to tell me that I added something to my gas.  I called my insurance company and they agreed to pay for it and said it could be vandalism.  They replaced the entire fuel system and now my car makes a grinding noise sometimes when I try to start it, it still hesitates and misses, and it still tries to stall on me some.  I have my 3rd appointment for the same problem but the dealership refuses to admit there is a problem.  I know one other person with a 2000 Neon and she has had hers in the shop 8 times for stalling on her.  I think there is a problem.  The only thing I like about the car is it has 4 doors and it was loaded with everything.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone who likes to feel safe in a car.
