            I bought my 1999 Avenger for the sporty looks.  I had planned on purchasing a sedan (usually do), but the value was very good compared to other sports cars with leather, CD and sun roof.  What I learned after purchasing the car...  The wheel base is very stiff, I cannot get into the tight parking spaces without a couple of adjustments.  The low profile tires and wheels, while spiffy, are a pain, especially if you do the drive through car wash.  The racks will bend your wheels.  I had to replace a tire at $178.00!!!  Wheels are several hundred dollars.  These are factors I had not considered when purchasing the car.  Additionally, the interior noise during highway driving is quite high. If you drive a black car, watch for tar that seals an in-door liner to drip from the bottom of your doors onto the running board.  This will markup pants, legs and pantyhose.! The car looks good, and was a good value.  I do still like Dodge products very much, but will go back to a sedan or SUV next time.<br><br>
