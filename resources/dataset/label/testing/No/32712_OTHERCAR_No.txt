            While this camera does many of the things one would expect from a digital camera it leaves much to be desired. The included 8MB memory card holds less than twenty quality pictures, around forty at the reasonably clear setting, and sixty or so very poor pictures on the &quot;economy&quot; setting. 
Its only merit was that it came with all the connections necessary to upload the pictures to my pc. This doesn't help you if you are out of memory, miles from your computer, and want to take some more photos. I wasn't at all impressed with the camera and returned it about 2 weeks after I bought it. I recommend a camera that uses a 3.5 floppy disk to store photos. There are many cameras that do this out there, and with the price of floppies so low you can take all the pictures you can look at an affordable price.<br><br>
