            I was stuck in that boring period between the end of the great Mercedes 300CE family and the birth of the phenominal Mercedes CL family.  I was kicking the tires in a Porsche/Audi dealership with too much loose change in my pocket.  Next thing I know I'm driving a 1999 911.  Wouldn't be bad except the damn thing breaks every six months.  That might not be so bad if it was a Benz, since they always service those the same day.  Problem is Porsche's break so much that the dealerships are backed up a week before they can even look at them.  What a pain in the ass.
Is the vehicle fun to drive... sure.  A tad more responsive than a 300CL Mercedes.  It's no faster and much less comfortable to sit in.
You should buy this vehicle if you feel the need to display your potency to the world.  If you want a trouble free ride that's a joy to drive every day and won't leave you stranded, stick to Mercedes!!!!!
