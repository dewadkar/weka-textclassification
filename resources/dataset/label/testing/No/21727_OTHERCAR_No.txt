            I�ve got a really great car (two, actually), a 1964 Volvo station wagon (the other�s a Jetta).  You would not believe how beautiful the thing is.  It�s all curves and chrome and small windows.  And unbelievably well built.  There�s a solidity that you can hear when you close the doors and the hatch for the way back (remember the way back from station wagons?  When I was a kid, sitting in the back meant sitting in the back seat, and sitting in the way back meant sitting backward in that little cargo area and watching the world slide away behind you).

While it was in the shop, I had to rent a car to get to work and stuff.  The car they stuck me with was a Chevy Cavalier.  What a piece of junk.  I�m never owning an American car, and whenever I see one of these on the road, I automatically make the assumption that it�s got to be a rental because I can�t see anyone ever actually wanting to drive and own one.

Ok, so the stereo was pretty good, and it had a CD player which is more than I can say for my �96 Jetta, but I tell you this: the thing just felt unsafe.  And when I got out and closed the door, the thing sounded hollow and made of tin.  Nothing about it made me think it would withstand anything more than hitting a skateboarder.  And not a tough one, either--not like Dave Bouie.

Dave was one of the best skateboarders I ever knew.  Once, we were skating at my parents house, using a little launch ramp down at the end of the driveway.  My parents were great: moving their cars to street, making sure there were plenty of snacks in the house, and not caring when the lot of us came inside all smelly and gross from being out in big Florida heat all day.

But at my parents house, on this one day when we were skating the launch ramp, Dave Bouie pulled off a 360 method air.  He didn�t have to do the method part.  It would have been huge to just do the 360, but he tossed in the little method just for flare.  I thought it was the coolest thing in the world at that moment, and at that moment, Dave Bouie went from being some punk skater kid (like the rest of us) and transformed into someone who could hang out with Rodney Mullen.

The Chevy Cavalier will never be able to hang out with the likes of Dave Bouie or Rodney Mullen.  But my Volvo could.  In the world of cars, it�s a 360 method air.

Man, it�s a shame you can�t bark at people in public without being arrested.
