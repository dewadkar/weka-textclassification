            Before I go much further I have something to ask: What's the big deal with the PT Cruiser?  Everywhere I go people treat this car like it's the best thing since indoor plumbing (except Alabama--they don't know what indoor plumbing is).  But honestly people this car is not the end-all be-all of cheap, practical transportation.

First let me talk of its virtuous features.  The PT is indeed very accommodating.  Plenty of room--especially in terms of headroom, as it is a rather tall automobile.  The interior styling is pleasant and I must admit the cue-ball shifter was particularly slick, if only because it's never been done on a production car (Is it a car?  I don't know.) of this era.  The seats are a snap to remove if necessary (although one is far heavier than the other) and once removed provide expansive space.  Visibility is quite commendable and gas economy is above average.  Sounds like a good start.

However being the enthusiast that I am the PT disappointed me when it came down to business.  Now I know most of you potential PT buyers won't be drag-racing or carving up backroads but I personally find those virtues to be vital to the driving experience.  Acceleration is sluggish at best, even when equipped with the manual (Over 8 seconds to 60?  With a manual?  Get a bigger engine, Chrysler--this car isn't that light.).  I can't imagine someone buying the automatic and then trying to merge into 60-mph freeway traffic.  That would be just plain suicide.  At least the PT handled better than I expected it to, considering its weight and center of gravity.  But in comparison to alternatives--small station wagons like the Saturn SW1 or VW Passat--the PT pales.  Granted, these wagons offer neither the utility nor &quot;unique&quot; styling of the PT but then I don't buy cars based merely on their utility or &quot;unique&quot; styling (unless you consider a prancing horse on a yellow background unique).  

In fact, the &quot;unique&quot; exterior styling is what got to me most.  This car attempts to be retro, what with the fat fenders and cue-ball shift.  But I must say I find it a shameless interpretation of classic designs.  It's trying too hard to be retro.  Now the Jaguar XK8, that's slightly retro, what with the headlight shape and subtle hood bulge reminiscent of the venerable E-type of the 60's.  Or the new Thunderbird, that's totally retro, since it looks like a logical evolution of the original T-Bird.  But the PT is in essence a collection of retro-ish design cues jumbled together to produce a vehicle that looks, in my estimation, horrifically overstyled.  However I am not foolish enough to believe my opinion of the styling will dissuade you people from buying one.  To each his own, right?  For the record, however, I will note that if I were to like the PT's styling I would give it a 3, maybe 3 1/2--as it stands though the PT is mired at 2.

In conclusion I say this:  Buy one if you must.  You will attract attention and you may very well like the styling and might not mind the terrible, buzzy, slow, unrefined engine which produces no acceleration.  You will suddenly become friends with people you don't know.  But to some others who know better than to buy some glorified mini-minivan you will be nothing more than a pompous fool insistent on showing off.  And yes, you may be the center of attention at every traffic light.  But remember that it's only because me and my station wagon have already blown by you and your newfound admirers as you struggle to get to the next stoplight.<br><br>
