            The poor Cougar may be nearing death row, I�m afraid, as dictated by poor sales. The current generation Cougar leapt out of the gate in 1997 to rave reviews and impressive initial sales. Things have quieted down a bit around Mercury showrooms of late, but the Cougar itself, while still a viable option, is an option if you don�t choose the better offerings available from other manufacturers.

The Cougar has had a hard life from day one, living in the shadow of more popular Ford cars, and being reborn so many times that nobody has ever really know what the Cougar was, or what to do with it. The Cougar began life in the mid 1960�s, as an up level Mustang to compete in the new executive muscle car market. In the early 70�s, it moved up and out, becoming a portly companion to the Ford Torino in the entry-level personal luxury coupe segment. In the late 70�s, the cougar was repositioned yet again, as a higher end personal luxury coupe, and paired up with the Ford Thunderbird. When the T-Bird turned into an aerodynamic sports coupe in 82, the Cougar followed suit, and road it�s Ford sister�s coat tails until 1996 when the company mercifully put the two out-of-date, marketless rear-drivers out of their misery. Later that year, the Cougar resurfaced as the sports coupe that you see today.

Wisely so, there really is no companion at Ford, this time around. Ford needed a coupe to cover the small specialty niche, left by the T-Bird and recently departed Probe. It was commonly understood that the T-Bird�s presence was stifling sale of the Lincoln Mark VIII and the Probe was having a similar affect on the Mustang. It was believed that if one car could be sporty enough to avoid Lincoln competition and elegant enough to miss stepping on the raucous Mustang, it would garner a healthy market share, save money, and allow other products in the lines to prosper.  Also, they were looking for a way to help distinguish Mercury, who, as you can tell from the example set forth, is primarily a dumping ground for tarted up Fords. Finally, Ford had spent unsurpassable amounts of money on its new Contour/Mystique world car platform. What better way to help recover invested cash than to spread the technology around. Enter the Cougar.

Where the Cougar may have no real equal at Ford, you must still consider it to be a 2-door Contour. When I say this, I mean that the body styling and interior are unique to the Cougar, everything else is Contour. Like it�s Ford sedan sister, two engines were offered, the Zetec inline 4-cylinder, and the Duratec V6. The inline 4 is an, enjoyable and relatively smooth little engine, producing 125 horsepower at 5,500 rpm�s. Mated to the five speed, anyone looking for a fun and practical sports coupe with economy oriented fuel consumption won�t be disappointed. Step up to Ford�s dual overhead cam, 24 valve V6 and you will be treated to 170 very smooth and linear horses. The standard five speed turns the Cougar into a spirited sprinter with 0-60 arriving in less than 8 seconds. Opt for the 4-speed automatic and, though you�ll loose a second and a half on that time, the Cougar takes on a more subdued, and elegant personality � a desirable feature for those that want to leave enthusiast driving to others. Balance on both cars, via a well designed four-wheel independent suspension, is terrific. Go for the 4-wheel disc brake/ABS option and the Cougar will stop from 70 miles per hour in a notable 183 feet.
 
Styling on the Cougar is undeniably unique. The car�s stance actually looks like a crouching cat. The nose follows this theme with gorgeous cat-eyed headlamps, and stylish lower air intake that has smirking, feline characteristics. An inverted �V� design graces the center of the hood, pointing forward, and could be the stripe pattern on top of a Tabby�s head. The tail of the car is no different, offering more stylized cat-eye lamps, and even small, lower bumper character lines that resemble whiskers! Some might be quick to point out that all of this over personification of form is a cheap tactic. They couldn�t be more incorrect. The Cougar�s design theme is simply overly tangible, and very refreshing. With a snazzy, windshield header mounted antenna, smart looking aluminum rims, and great rocker, and upper body sweep lines that draw attention down to the front (drive) wheels (emphasizing the car�s power),you have a package that gets noticed. Inside, the design work is even better. A few switches, the steering wheel, and the center console have been pirated from the first generation Contour; everything else is pure Cougar. These theft choices were good ones too, as the Ford�s thick steering wheel feels just as luxurious in this environment. Also, the Contour�s attractive center console�s only flaw, the gimmicky, pop-up cup holders, has been removed for application in the Cougar. The rest of the interior work is simply sublime, featuring, classing materials, nice textures, and great form. The circular vents are snappy and seemingly French-horn inspired inner door panels are to die for.
 
So why, after such a glowing review, am I not recommending the Cougar? Well, I did nab a little drive time in 4 and 6 cylinder Cougars a while back while helping my wife's former assistant shop for a new car. I believe that the Cougar covers the luxury coupe and pocket-rocket segments of the market somewhat nicely. But, I also believe that most buyers don�t straddle that fence. So, if you are reading this, then you fall into one of two groups; those that are not interested in performance, instead wanting a stylish, comfortable coupe and those that want an unusual hot-rod that will boil the blood out of the box or even provide a nice mechanical platform for performance mods. Either way, there is something better out there for you.
Some of you, who may have read my Ford Contour SVT article are probably wondering how I could pour, for pages, over the wonderful performance virtues of that car, and yet be so critical of the Cougar�s performance when we are talking about essentially the same car? Well, let me explain myself. We are talking about a different market of cars. The SVT Contour and more directly, the Contour SE V6 are competing in a sedan bracket where civilities are valued slightly more highly than psychotic revs. Also, something was lost when the Contour made the transformation into the Cougar. I am not sure of the cause, but I have never seen a Cougar that can match a similarly optioned Contour�s performance. Finally, the Contour comes off as two steps above rental car status, but offers a performance experience that few can for the money. The Cougar on the other hand offers similar performance, but looks like Jennifer Lopez fresh from the salon � that said, the hot shot street action seems almost disappointing.
Gear heads wanting a road rocket are also undoubtedly considering the Integra, Golf, Prelude, and Celica. This is fine, Mercury expects you to. In some ways (dimensions, price, power), the V6 Cougar is the spiritual successor to the Probe GT. But even the dated GT would stand up better to these guys. To begin with, the Cougar�s powerplant dates back to its 1995 introduction, making it some of the most dated technology here. The Cougar, while smooth and powerful, offers one of the bulkiest and heaviest engines of the group. What once offered free-spirited tach-dances, now seems to rev very slowly, next to these new variable-valve-timed guys.  Sometimes, you have the feeling that there�s more performance available, but the Cougar doesn�t make it easy to find. The shifter seems bulky and uncooperative and the steering, which feels nicely bolstered in the conservative Contour, feels overly sensitive and uncommunicative in the Cougar. Though road hold tests have shown the Mercury can pull an acceptable .83 g�s, and lane change maneuvers are quite competitive, the fully independent suspension doesn�t feel very active in the equation and the BF Goodrich Comp T/A�s scramble to grip patches of pavement instead of flow over it. In other words the car doesn�t feel very planted when at its limits. Don�t get me wrong, the Cougar will dance, all the ingredients for success are there. However, when pushing the Cougar, it feels more like an ornery adversary, than a willing accomplice.

Turning now to the personal luxury coupe market (something the Mercury knows a little about) the Cougar proves only adequate once more. The V6 is not a boiling screamer, this we have already discussed. So, the 5-speed may not be the best way to utilize the car. Paired with the 4-speed automatic, the Cougar becomes very well mannered, and comfortable. Unfortunately, Ford�s 2.5 liter multi valve plant seems to draw the best on road performance (unpleasant as it may be) from revs. That said, the V6 turns rather timid in this role. Those looking to the Cougar as the personal luxury coupe would be wise to consider the new Chrysler Sebring coupe, Honda Accord coupe, and Mitsubishi�s new, more up-market Eclipse V6. Choosing one of these, will garner you smoother, more powerful V6 engines, better overall performance (for touring purposes), and more spacious, comfortable interiors.  Even if you still want to shift yourself, the V6/ manual combinations from Chrysler and Mitsubishi will feel more satisfying and with an additional 30 or so horsepower, faster. Also, while the sharp features of the Mercury�s interior are eye catching, they cannot match the clean, simple, free flowing appeal of the Sebring, Accord, and Eclipse. These cars also feature more forgiving suspension settings (the Cougar has the hard feel of a "handling package� car instead of simply a balanced overall suspension). The Cougar�s seats are not very comfortable during lengthy exposure either, and rear headroom is not generous.

There was, however, a wildcard in the bunch, that I should mention. For almost a year, Ford blew smoke about the upcomming Cougar S, which may have answered these performance questions. The S model would have taken advantage of all the glorious performance modifications that made the SVT Contour so great. This would include a heavy-duty clutch, cooling system, and fan. Also included would be an oil cooler, modified engine management chip, extrude honed intake manifold, better tires, and real twin exhausts. The whole effect would give the Cougar an extra 30 horsepower and 4 pound-feet of torque. I have driven a Contour SE and SVT, so based on those differences, I would surmise that the S could have hit 60 closer to the seven second mark with top speed more like 140. Rev�s would flow a little more freely, and the S would have more juice in the top end, making it more competitive with the variable-valvers. Unfortunately, though it is now confirmed that Ford will not build this car, robbing the Cougar of any chance it may have had in the serious pocket rocket segment.

Ultimately, the Cougar is composed of parts that were rather state of the art. Unfortunately, in recent years, the competition has taken giant leaps forward, leaving the Cougar holding it�s ground and hoping knowone will notice. The Cougar tries to be all things to all (coupe) buyers. It does a lot of things well, but is unfortunately competing in markets where cars simply do them better. Please be mindful, that the Cougar is more comfortable than a Celica, cheaper than a Golf VR6, and more engaging to drive then an Accord Coupe. But I just don�t believe that you fence straddlers are out there, subsequently, a Celica buyer doesn�t care about more shoulder room, and an Accord buyer doesn�t want an 8000 rpm redline. In the end, the Cougar tries to cover all these basis with middling success, instead of picking a topic, and doing it well, like some of it�s competitors. Ultimately, it may not be the most beautiful, talented, or easy to live with, but you will notice the Cougar when it is in your presence. Sort of like Cher.
