            I bought a 1998 Wrangler new in June of '98.  I've owned 2 cherokees, and a CJ5, all purchased new in the past. The 98 Wrangler is a hybrid of the old CJ units, and the more luxurious cherokees.  The sheet metal dash is gone, and replaced with a softer padded dash and instrument panel.  Comfortable appearing and user friendly.  All instruments and controls are easy to reach, easy to control, and get your hands back on the wheel quickly.  This is a good thing, as the short wheelbase of the Wrangler makes for a vehicle that will change direction and drift quickly unless you are paying attention.  This is especially true on the highway.  Wranglers have a much rougher ride than most other SUV's. This is true even though the leaf springs have been eliminated, and coils are now used.  The shocks are good for off road, although perhaps if you are going to be &quot;rough&quot; on it you will want to opt for a tighter shock--as an aftermarket purchase.  Visibility is typical jeep.  High up, good clearance, and, since your jeep is so short, you can see 360 degrees around you right away.  I bought the 4 cylinder 5 speed manual transmition.  Plenty of power in most circumstances, especially when the correct gear is used.  Steering is tight, and a tendency to oversteer must be compensated for by the driver.  Doors and top are only to protect the occupants from the weather, so the seatbelt system is a bit heavier duty than found in most vehicles.  By the way, the top and both doors are removed in about 10 minutes, converting it into a totally different type of car.  What fun, whether off road or around town.  There is not much room inside, it is small, but what a blast--I completely recommend it.<br><br>
