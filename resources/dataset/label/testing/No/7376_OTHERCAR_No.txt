            I've always heard nothing but great things about Subaru's. All the commercials show the cars hauling through exciting terrain, with tons of storage space and safety standards...

I've been completely let down since I actually bought one myself. I opted for the Impreza Sport model. It costs a few hundred more than your average Impreza with the upgraded fog lights, keyless remote entry with alarm, a front bug deflector and a rear spoiler. 

The dealers boasted about the storage space, the flawless handling in the winter snow storms and spring rains and the comfort of the ride. They insisted that the car would take me anywhere I wanted to go on the Colorado roads, and much more safely than my SUV would. They were great sales people!

The Impreza does have the storage space, as long as no one else is going to be coming along with you. I had a hard time fitting 4 adults and three suitcases in the car on a recent trip to the airport. But, it did fit 2 snowboards and all the gear for a weekend to the mountains with one seat folded down. Priorities, I guess.

The winter handling during slow speeds have been great, but at higher speeds the car handling is downright scary. Having driven a small SUV for 9 years, I was used to kicking in the 4x4 and taking charge, getting myself out of high snow and keeping on the road. The Impreza's AWD doesn't compare and isn't all it's cracked up to be.

The one thing that stands out to me as being the biggest pitfall of owning this car in the state of Colorado is the engery lacking engine. The pick up is horrible! I think my Impreza cries each time I make a pass into the mountains! The engine revs up and down with the slightest inclines, taking forever to catch up to speed (and I often need to brake just as it does gain speed, as the car is now careening down a large hill!).

My fiance dislikes the car for all of these reasons and more. For him, at 6'3", it's small inside. The legroom is more tight than the headroom, but the body room is smaller. He often complains of feeling "squished in" and does not enjoy those long rides in the mountains at all! He also complains of many blind spots, in comparrison to our small SUV and full size sedan. 

My opinion on this car is also based upon the Subaru Service and Warranty that we got with the car. We brought the car in for it's very first service and got it returned to us with ABSOLUTELY NO FLUIDS IN THE ENGINE! I'm sure that has a lot to do with it's plaugeing problems today...
We also just got a notification in the mail (one year after buying and driving the car) that there is a recall on the driving gears that may cause the brake systems to fail. For a company who prides themselves on safety, this ranks low in my book!

My expectations were much higher of Subaru when I bought this car...It's not a COMPLETELY bad car though. It's rather inexpensive for the safety features that it has, AWD capabilities and size class. We got a great price for ours!
