            Our '93 Sable GS Wagon was a steal when we bought it - five years old and $2,000 under LOW book. We were ecstatic. This thing is loaded. Full power, digital dash, extra radio controls near the gauges for the driver, third seat, everything but leather. AND - it only had 40,000 miles on it. It has run excellent for the last two years. It looks really sharp, and is a dream to drive. Then -- the heater core cracks, and cracks big time. Not a big deal, right? The core on my truck cracked, 30 minutes and $30 lighter I have a core in. Not so with the Sable. Apparently, the heater core is suspended from the ceiling at the factory by fishing wire, and the car is built around it. Four opinions. $1000. From each.

So, I nurse it for a week. Keep it full of fluids, etc. Take it to a friend that does work. It will need:

Heater core
Heads (apparently these are weak on early '90's Fords)
Water pump
Hoses
Soft plugs (the things that fall out of the engine block if the coolant freezes)
He will need - $5000.

That was tough news. I had, really, loved this little wagon. Here's the review:

Power - got it. It has the 3.8L engine, and it moves out. 

Room - it's a wagon. All kinds of room, and the kids love the rear seat sitting backwards looking at those who follow us, and with the power this has, everyone does. 

Looks - sharp. Even for a wagon, they have factory ground effects, and they look very sleek. We tinted the windows, and it really looks like a little sports car.

Mileage - great. We have the little trip computer (like I said, loaded), and we pull about 27 mpg on the highway, averaging 19 with very heavy in town driving.

Reliability - not so much. I was stunned with the repair bill for this thing. Our mechanic said that Sables/Taurus' are the worst to work on, they are laid out terribly. The interior even has problems. The door panels are all loose - I think the Christmas Tree Clips are broken, but that would be all of them on every door. The little plastic covers on the air conditioner buttons have cracked and broken. The mirror fell off. And so forth. We've had it to the dealer for a multifunction switch - Ford apparently has their multifunction switches built by primitive tribes deep in the heart of the Amazon that don't know what wiring is - and an ignition cylinder - ditto the tribes. Ford in general has a problem with both of these, and no mechanic will touch the switch. You have to go to the dealer - has something to do with the driver's airbag. I didn't even get into the transmission trouble we have begun to have. Slipping, slipping, slipping. Last thing - the power steering pump is toast. Also not a weekend warrior thing - it's pretty tough to get to. 

So, now the choice - what to do with the car? We tried selling, nary a nibble. Repair? To quote my mechanic - You can give me five grand, and you'll still have a piece of - maybe I won't quote him. The work to put into it just isn't worth it. We are better off picking up something else and giving this to charity, so we are.

I would, sadly, not recommend the Sable. Not unless you own a garage (the mechanic kind, not the two car attached kind) and can throw this bad boy up on a rack a couple times a year for some serious work. I really like the car, and wish I could keep it forever, but the repair bill and future reliability just won't let me do it, or recommend it.<br><br>
