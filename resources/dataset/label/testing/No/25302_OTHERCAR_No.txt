            I am a photographer - and own 3 Nikon bodies, and have been extremely happy with them. So it stands to reason that when I was ready for a digital camera, the first place I went was Nikon.  I hate to admit this - but I owned this Nikon for exactly one week, and returned it for an Olympus!  If you are reading this review, it is likely that you are a semi-serious to serious photographer as well - these are not cameras for the point and shoot daytime camera buffs!

OK - so here's the scoop.  The resolution of the 700 is not that great - for the price tag.  It does not have nearly the flexibility of the Olympus (600L OR C2000), and really needs the addition of an optical zoom lens which it doesn't have.   But most importantly, the LCD display was not protected, and the focus (which is critical to me) was less than perfect.  3 out of 5 shots were not in focus, proving to me that smaller is not necessarily better, unless smaller is ALSO designed with alot of attention to details.  The Nikon 700 buttons were difficult to press (anyone with big hands will have a problem, or anyone like me who has a touch of arthritis).

What is good - it does have fairly good resolution, and does have the capacity to adjust lighting and distance if you need.  It also has the capacity to recharge batteries (using the AC adapter/recharger).  But you can just as easily do this with rechargeable batteries which cost alot less than the recharger for Nikon.  (By the way, this isn't advertised, but was available for the Nikon 600 so I tried it!)

When I compare it to the Olympus line of digital cameras, I do not feel it has enough to warrant the price.  I never thought I'd say this - but the Olympus is far easier to use.  They all come with accessories that will allow for floppy disk download, AC adapter, soft leather cases, etc.  The Nikon does not allow for additional lenses (the Olympus sells a lens threader that will allow you to use other lenses on it)or for an external flash (Olympus does!).  I just don't think for the $ that this camera makes sense.

Good luck camera shopping - I've done alot of homework - and this one is not on the top of my list.<br><br>
