            Using automatic settings, the color is off on every picture so I have to edit them and raise cyan, green and yellow.  Thy all seem to be a tad bit blurry too.

Pictures in the dark are just better than my old 1.2MP camera.  The flash was way too bright if the object was within 6 feet.  The red-eye flash flashes twice, pauses, then take the picture.  By then the person has already thought the picture was taken had moved.

Video was only a little choppy, and the pixel squares were big time obvious.  But I still use it all the time.

Navigating the menu is awkward and will take a while to get used to.

Another major annoyance it the long time it takes between pictures and turning the camera on.  

Downloading pictures directly for the camera was easy and fast with XP, no software was needed.  Speaking of software, it came with a bunch.  My favorite is PhotoShow2.  Put your pictures in a show with animation, text and music.  But after the 3rd of 4th show, you wish for more options.

It comes with 2 regular batteries, but I use rechargeable batteries.  Seems like it lasted about a week with a good amount of use.  My old camera held 4 batteries and it operated maybe a month.

Only thing I can hope for is that manual settings drastically improve the image.
