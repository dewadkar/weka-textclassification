            Just got my new MVC-fd95 on Friday June 30 th, this is my third mavica. I also own the MVC-fd73 and the MVC-fd91. I Really looked forward to this camera's debut. But am a bit disappointed in a few minor areas. 
First: the reduction of the lcd screen and the new menu control is hard to get used to. the smaller lcd makes it more difficult to frame a decent shot and know that you are getting what you intended. Second: the delay in freezing to recording can cause you to miss an action shot. Also When it was announced, no one mentioned that the smart media card adapter would be necessary, that is an automatic $65-$80 on top of the already pricey $999 my husband paid for the camera. But overall the MVC-fd95 has enough added features to get me to overlook what I was just complaining about. It also comes with a 4x floppy drive that seems a bit noisy but seems to function well. I really like the "thru the lens" view finder that this model has. it is a big plus when you don't want to use your lcd. Overall I still have to give the MVC-fd95 a high recommendation for ease of use and great pictures!!! 

UPDATE:::: I am updating this review because I have been really using my camera and feel there should be some issues brought up that I diddn't come across at my last review. The biggest is the issue of the memory stick adapter. This adapter which is the only way possible to use the memory stick adds a horrendous amount of lag time to the internal processing which is unacceptable. Had I known about this from the beginning I would not have bought this camera I would have waited. The lag time is significant enough to render this camera unsuitable for action filming. Trust me I have tried to make do with it but no use. I recently tried to photograph some friends who were in a rodeo event and it was no use. By the time you press the shutter and wait for the picture to record, it's gone. Avoid thid one if you are looking for a action ready digital camera.. it is just not capable.  

UPDATE to my UPDATE: After speaking with Bill Gray from the Sony national customer service center in New Jersey who was less than helpful, I am left with the dismal news that they cannot or will not upgrade my camera to the mvc-fd97 which addresses and fixes the issues that I have been experiencing, mainly lag time to record to memory stick and the inability to record an uncompressed image to a floppy although it has a stting to allow this to occur the image fills the floppy and prevents it from completing the task due to size.. DUH?? an oversite or a bug? Mr. Gray said I should have the camera serviced.. For what I asked him.. failure to perform as advertised? Or failure to disclose design flaws, then fix the flaws call them an upgrade and tell customers your outta luck service department. hmmmm Do they have a truth in advertising service for my camera? Is that like an oil change or the 50k mile service on my car? will they rotate the tires? Just like a car dealership they lure you in with shiney paint jobs pollished wheels but it's still the same old lemon, the same old plaid wearing salesman who takes your money then shruggs his shoulders when you ask about the advertised gas mileage that your car in it's best day downhill could never acomplish.. he tells ya sorry lady or sorry pal, your actual mileage may vary, well your actual performance may vary , but the service department is consistant, sorry we can't help you youre stuck with this crap.. Your company won't get any more of my hard earned dollars Mr. Gray... oh and Mr. Gray... Would like to hear from you I am sure!!! call him and tell him SHAME!!!! SHAME!!! JUST SAY NO TO BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!! 941-768-7513
