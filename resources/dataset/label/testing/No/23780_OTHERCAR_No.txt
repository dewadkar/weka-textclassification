            I commend Toyota bringing the public a very fuel efficient econo-car. I really do. With the OPEC Hokey Pokey that's been going on as of late, Toyota execs were probable under the delusions Americans would ditch their gas-guzzling SUV's in favor of 41 MPG ride - you'd think right? 

Enter The Echo.  41 MPG and that's about as good as it gets.

<b>Deceptive Pricing </b>

I am not an SUV driver ... but I was searching for a new inexpensive car, The Echo, and at first glance seemed like a real bargain.  The base sticker price is under $10,000 - but it's deceivingly low.  When they say BASE model, they mean BASE model. I wasn't looking for anything fancy - I was willing to roll up my own windows - but once you start adding on a few things here and there, just to make the car driveable - it adds up quickly.

Even a digital clock is option.  I am not kidding.  Toyota wants you to shell out 70 bucks MSPR for the luxury of knowing what time it is while on the road.

And this one really got me - <i>POWER STEERING is an option. </i> An OPTION.  I may not be the most savvy car buyer on the planet - but don't you think it's a bit odd for Toyota to want you to shell out $270 MSRP for an "option" no one has paid for on a new car since, say,  the 70's?

Not only is the pricing deceiving - it's confusing.  In most cases you can't just "cherry pick" options.  I wanted a 5 spd, with AC, cruise control maybe an AM/FM cassette.  But according to the option packages on the Echo...in order to get AC ($925 MSPR) it's required you have Auto Idling control ($0 MSRP) and RC which is a radiator cover ($0 MSPR).  Which would seem ok, right?  I  mean neither of those "options" cost anything?  Think again, because in order to have Auto Idling control it requires you have CK which is All Weather Guard Package ($275 MSRP) which includes cold area package, heavy duty battery, heavy duty rear heater, and heavy duty rear defogger.  AND in order to have the Radiator cap (which I remind you is required to get the AC) you have to have the Upgrade Package #2 ($1465 MSRP) which includes air conditioning, deluxe 3-in-1 combo radio and power door locks.  

I don't need to point out how confusing this is.  And if you DO managed to not fry your brain trying to muddle through that mess you could wind up paying an extra $4,000 (MSRP) to make it driveable.  Sure it's still a new car for under $15,000 - but with a base price of $9,756 (invoice)  - I think it's deceptive.  And if you're gonna drop a few thousand dollars on something, do you really want to go through all of that to find out you're paying $70 for a clock?

<b> Test Drive </b>
Undaunted by the head-spinning pricing system, I took The Echo out for a test spin. Three different times, once an automatic, twice the 5 spd.  

First impression? Tiiiiiiiiimber. I felt like I was driving a saltine carton on wheels.  This baby is B-O-X-Y.  And I am not even talking about it's "unique" exterior.  I can handle that - I encourage such an irreverant design.  I am talking about the box like design that means you have to take corners SLOW so as not to wind up like a turtle on its back. It's tall stance and tiny wheel base makes it virtually no fun.  

The power was decent, I didn't have a problem passing another car (BMW in fact) on a 2 lane road - but don't try passing on a windy day.  The Echo's fuel efficiency is partly attributed to its barely there weight.  The steering seemed a bit loose, but maybe Toyota decided that wasn't a real priority considering you wouldn't be hugging and corners at 60 mph anytime soon after purchase.  The automatic had no get up and go - the only way to really get it to take off was to floor it (to the horror of my salesman) ... plus it seemed as though the gears were really working overtime. The 5 spd had much of the same overall ride as the automatic, but the engine seemed to growl more.  It made a lot of "big engine noise" without delivering the power performance. But I guess at 108 horsepower I should not be disappointed.

<b> Interior: More Space Than NASA </b>

Storage space that is.  Get in an Echo and everywhere you look there's a little nook or cranny to store something. Including a huge seemingly purposeless vertical gap on the dash between the controls and the glove box.  What could you possible need to take with you that would merit such space? CD's?  Portfolio?  Crock Pot?  You want to take it along for the ride, chances are Toyota's got a place for you to put it.  Lots of space is good - but do you really want to spend that much time wondering whether or not you put the map and the tire pressure gauge in the glove box, in the visors, center console, center part of the dash, on the door or in the back seat?  A bit exaggerated sure, but I encourage you to take a peek for your self and have a good chuckle...  

But on a positive there was a lot of leg and head room and the seats were easily adjustable.  The seats are positioned so high up in fact you get that "I'm in the Captain's (as in Kirk's) Chair and I am in CHARGE of this vehicle" feeling.

And did you know the speedometer in The Echo is not in front of you - but cocked over to the side above where most car stereos are in most cars?  Sure, it's at an angle so it faces the driver... but is it a good idea to take your eyes off the road in front of you JUST to glance to your right to see how fast you are going?  I am all for an unconventional approach - But what were they thinking? It is said Toyota designed it this way to add an extra driver side crash safety feature - but it seems you just might need that "new safety" feature if only because you took your eyes off the road to see how fast you were going.

So, over all my driver experience left much to be desired.  I know there are many happy Echo owners out there, but it just isn't my kinda ride.

It's all a shame really because 41 MPG could save me lot of money - I drive over 120 miles a day - but considering that's over 2 hours in the car a day, I need something I can feel comfortable driving.

And it's also unfortunate in order to get Americans out of their gas guzzlers and into super efficient econo-cars the car industry is going to  need to make a little more noise than this tiny Echo.
