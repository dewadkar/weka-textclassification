            So much for no haggle.  I went into the dealership with no preconception.  After I was presented with the MSRP of a fully loaded Saturn SL2 for the price of a Honda Accord, the sales rep. starting "negotiating" and dropping the price until she confided to me that the S-Series Sales are down 20% from last year and 15% a year before that!  The dealer was willing to do whatever it took to sell me a unit off the lot.  I was eventually drawn in by the price and the plastic body panels foresaking all else.

Well here I am almost a year later, the happy owner of our first Saturn.  The sales delivery was first rate.  BUT......

There's an old saying that you get what you pay for.  As long as you stick to that, the Saturn will be an excellent choice.  On the other hand, I was hoping that good ole american know-how could actually stick it to the imports....

The folks in Tennessee should stick to making moonshine, they certainly don't have the knack for automobile making.  Any wonder the imports are winning the "fit and finish" argument.  For all intents and purposes, the Saturn's interior is not very refined.  I feel like it was slapped together.  The trunk and liner (it's really a glorified cloth cover) is dismal.  The interior of the trunk and doors has caulking drops all over the place.  During highway driving, the wind noise from the windshield indicates that they obviously forgot to plop some caulking around that area.  Good thing they did, the wind noise distracts you from the sound of the fuel sloshing around the tank and what appears to be suspension or springs  creaking.  At a stoplight, I can hear the radio playing in the car beside me.  There are plenty of bells and whistles (still working) but aside from a single dome light, there is no additional interior lighting.  No light in the glove box either.  Speaking of dome lights, the glue that hold the liner in place has long since lost it's grip.  The dome now hangs four inches lower than when I bought the car last fall.  The dealer offered to reglue the liner (??) but I would need to leave the car for a few days.  The "upgraded" seat are terrible.  They lack any substantial padding.  An adult in the rear seat is in for a very harsh experience.  The interior door handles had sharp plastic "burrs" that the dealer corrected.  The center console creaks in cold weather.  When shifting gears, the whole console moves!

In my opinion the pre-delivery inspection is really just a money grab:  As part of the purchase agreement, the dealer installed some foglamps for me.  A few days after delivery I opened up the hood to discover that a few of the grounding straps were unscrewed, the ail filter housing was unscrewed (actually the screws were missing), the battery sheath (on the positive side) was actually hanging into the air filter compartment and the hose going into the pcv valve was disconnected!  The dealer did take responsibility for this misfortunate instance by giving me a free oil change.  I'm only worried about what I can't see.  

Even with the DOHC engine, acceleration is very poor.  The ride is quite firm.  Cornering is suprisingly good. 

The car runs forever on a tank of gas.  On the highway it can hold its' own.  A little sluggish when passing.  If you're a Saturn owner and have the "flash to pass" feature, try this:  The drivers' side headlight will actually light up a half second before the passenger side.  A few folks commented about that before I actually noticed!  I'm not sure if that's intended.  A mechanic friend of mine jokingly told me that the Saturn engineers can't have both headlights come on at the same time or the electrical system be overloaded.
