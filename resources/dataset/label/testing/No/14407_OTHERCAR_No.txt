            I worked for a Detailing company in Beverly Hills last summer.  One of the many exotic sports cars that I was able to wash and drive was a Lamborghini Diablo.  Not just any Lamborghini Diablo but Nicholas Cage's Diablo.  He owned five of them in five different colors.  I was able to drive the yellow one.  

At first I was just so excited to be driving a Diablo and to be driving Cage's car.  Once I got over that I found out that it wasn't as enjoyable to drive as I was expecting.  The view out of the windows was terrible.  The steering was tight but difficult to navigate at low speeds.  The suspension was very tight and very uncomfortable.  

This car was only made to go very fast and if you are not going 100 miles an hour it is awful to cruise in.  Don't get me wrong I had a good time driving it and it looks awesome and I have always wanted one but it doesn't even compare to the feeling to a Ferrari.  And guess who has one of those also.<br><br>
