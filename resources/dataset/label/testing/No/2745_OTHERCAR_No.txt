            Let me preface this review by stating that I am not someone who writes letters of complaint to companies, letters to the editor, and reviews on any topic.  However, I feel so passionate about our experience with the Chevy S-10 that I just can't restrain myself, so here goes.

My husband and I bought this truck used in 1998 with 50,000 miles on it.  It was a sharp looking truck, two tone blue with a custom paint job and extended cab.  Prior to purchasing this truck, we had a Honda Civic, so we were used to a pretty reliable vehicle.  We bought the truck because we really wanted something a little larger that we could use for hauling.  Initially, we were thrilled with our purchase.  We were looking spiffy, the truck had a pleasing drive, good handling, nice interior, and decent gas mileage.  

The honeymoon lasted about three months, which brings me to the cons.  Or I should say con, as this vehicle had one major flaw-reliability, or lack thereof.  In the four years we owned this vehicle, we had it in the shop 15 times, with our repair bills totaling $4,992 (these numbers do not include any regular maintenance, such as oil changes, battery replacement, new tires, etc-these numbers refer only to true repairs).  

Although I could go on and on regarding the reliability issues, the two most significant problems were numerous electrical issues (very, very expensive to locate and fix the problems) and ongoing problems with the air conditioning and heating.  

As an example of the electrical problems we experienced, every time it rained, we had problems getting the truck started.  We brought it in for diagnosis repeatedly at different repair shops, but they could never find anything wrong with it.  Since they couldn't find and fix the problem, we wound up crossing our fingers every time it rained, hoping the truck would start, and then having to leave it running for 30-45 minutes each time in order to dry out whatever was wet under the hood to ensure that the truck would re-start.  

As for the air conditioning and heating-the problem was pretty straightforward.  They just wouldn't work properly, resulting in a pretty warm ride in the summer and pretty brisk ride in the winter.

I am thrilled to say that we no longer own this vehicle.  The straw that broke the camel's back was the day that my husband was driving down the road and drove slo-o-o-o-o-wly over a speed bump, only to have the left front ball joint snap and send the left front wheel rolling merrily down the street.  The truck, and my husband, however, were not rolling anywhere-they were stopped dead in the middle of the street.  It took four hours for the tow truck to come, during which time my husband did a lot of pondering, and decided that we needed a new vehicle.  An additional irony is that we had just retrieved the truck from the repair shop the week before where we had had the front brakes replaced.  As we left the repair shop, I jokingly asked the owner if he thought anything was going to break anytime soon.  He assured us that it was in tip top shape, and that we were good to go.  As a result, when the tow truck drug the wheel-less Chevy back into his shop a week later, he gave us a big price break on the tow and the ball joint repair.

At that point, we had had it, and, as a result, we just recently traded the 1994 Chevy S-10 in on a 2002 Toyota Tundra (yes, you guessed right, our purchasing decision was 100% based on the Tundra's reliability record).  We got $3,000 on trade, so our four year cost owning this vehicle was not including tax, license, insurance, gas, and regular maintenance), $13,774, or $3,444 per year, or $287 per month.  For that price, we could have purchased a brand new truck off the lot and forgone all of the many hassles we experienced with this vehicle. 

In sum, nice looking truck, but our experience was that reliability of this vehicle was the absolute pits.
