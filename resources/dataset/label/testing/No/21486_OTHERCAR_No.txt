            I really thought I was going to love this car when I first bought it.  The only thing I ended up loving was the HUD.  The stack of paperwork I have for this car is unbelievable.  I had 3 separate water leaks, trunk, side window, and wheel well.  The latter each taking 4 repair attempts and the former taking 6 repair attempts.  The transmission was making noise and would not kick into gear by 40,000 miles, the engine had constant hesitations at 55mph that the dealership could of course never find.  

It took suing General Motors to get them to fix my trunk properly.  I had asked them to replace my car or give me $3,000 towards a new car, they wouldn't.  It cost them $4,000 and $3,000 to my attorneys.  This is definitely a company that doesn't care about the people they sell their cars too.  I know many others that have had several similar problems and Pontiac and GM do nothing to help.

PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, you're just rolling the dice to see if you get a good Grand Prix or a bad one.<br><br>
