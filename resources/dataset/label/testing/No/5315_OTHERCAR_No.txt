            I own a Honda Accord 98 V6 with all the whistles and bells. Discovered that my speedometer is 10% inaccurate.  Dealer replaced it at 11k but told me new one would also be off by up to 10%. Honda recently sent me a letter saying their speedometers are permitted to be 10% inaccurate as that is their manufacturers standard for this part. Other than inaccurate speedo this car is great. Lots of power (even tho I'm never sure what speed I am traveling at), good gas mileage and well put together. The vtec engine lives up to reputation but would not buy another Honda product again until they make a speedometer that is more accurate.  Apparently there is no federal standard for speedometer accuracy.  Wish I had known before I bought.<br><br>
