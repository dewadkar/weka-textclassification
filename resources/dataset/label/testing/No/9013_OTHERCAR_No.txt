            Moving around the world with my company means that I get a few perks, one of which is driving a hire car of an extended period of time. In February when I moved to the Bay Area, I picked up KIA Sportage from Enterprise, with only a few thousand miles on the clock. 

Driving off the lot into the early evening traffic, the mini SUV comfortable and suited to the commute. With a nice and high driving position and a reasonable amount of space around me, it did not feel too much different from a regular SUV. Once at home, my wife strapped in the baby seat, threw the stroller in the rear, and proceeded to use this as her everyday car. 

The first thing I noticed was how underpowered this SUV was, in fact for the first few days my wife and I had to check that we were not driving around with the hand brake on. Then we figured that we must have been driving in 4WD mode, as the acceleration was so sluggish and the MPG was poor. We spent hours trying to move the drive selector to 2WD before realizing that we were already in 2WD. 

The ride itself could be described as �interesting� at best. Once the SUV was upto speed on the freeway everything was fine, maybe a little bit of excessive road noise, but not overpowering. At lower speeds, and especially when cornering at about 30-40mph, the body roll was sometimes alarming. Real care and attention needed to be taken when coming down mountain roads for instance, or on a sharp freeway off-ramp. Once you get to know the limitations of the ride, it was okay, but it always seemed to catch me out on the odd occasion. My wife felt the ride was acceptable when driving around town, or for short trips, but the thought of a 300-mile trip would leaves us looking for cheap flight tickets.

The 4-speed automatic was fine for town and freeway driving. The only time it felt problematic was on long steep inclines where the automatic selector seemed not to be able to make up it�s mind whether it should be in 2nd or 3rd gear, and swapped between both gears constantly.

The brakes worried me from the start. At first I could not be sure if the front discs were partially engaged all the time, and with the huge amount of brake dust accumulating on the wheels, it was difficult to tell. I suspect that this was the case, as after long freeway trips the smell of the brakes could be detected as soon as I got out of the car. The brake response was reasonably soft, but not soft enough to cause real alarm, but certainly less than I like. As I said, the front wheels were black with dust after a few miles, while the rear drum brakes were clean as a whistle�..

The interior trim and finish of the car was quite good. The adjustable center armrest was very good, with a nice deep storage compartment. The Glove box was poor with only enough space for the manual, but there are other storage areas around the drivers seat that held a few items. The cargo area in the back is quite small, but this is a mini SUV after all. It is big enough to take a large shopping load, or the equipment needed to take a trip to the beach, but anything more than that will need the rear seats folding down.  I went out occasionally to purchase some large items, and with the rear seats down, there is a sizeable cargo area.

My overall impression of the Sportage was that for a small SUV it was OK, not too impressive in any particular area, but only really poor in it�s engine power. If you only have a small budget and need a second car that can carry a fair amount of cargo, it�s make a good deal of sense.

If you want and SUV, you better go for the real thing��.
