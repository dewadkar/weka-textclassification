            The problem with reviewing the Jetta is that even though it has been my most problematic car I still love it the most. Perhaps Volkswagen has done a good job of alleviating cognitive dissonance, or maybe it's my rationalization for buying a car with suspect build quality. Whatever the case may be I still really like the car.

The 2001 Jetta is the fourth generation in the Jetta family tree. Among the auto enthusiasts it's known as the Jetta IV. This generation sports four different engine types: the basic 2.0L engine, the 1.8L Turbo engine, The 4-cylinder TDI engine, and the well respected 2.8L VR6 engine. Along with the different engine types comes three different body styles: GL, GLS, and GLX. The main difference in these models is the number of whiz-bang features. The GL is the most basic and the GLX is the most luxurious. The GLS falls somewhere in-between. All models come standard with many features including 6 airbags, four wheel anti-lock disk brakes, AM/FM Cassette, cruise control, and many other options. One of the best things about the Jetta is the fact that they come feature-laden at even the cheapest models. Models are available with a 5-speed manual transmission or a lackluster 4-speed automatic. 

So let's go over the problems I've had. First, my front left speaker just quit on me, then my 6-disk CD changer started skipping CD's, and then my radio just flat out died on me. All were repaired under warranty. The lights on my center console went out, and my center armrest clip broke (it was made out of cheap plastic). Both cupholders in the car are broken (not to mention the fact that they are placed in a horrible position to begin with). The cloth seats collect lint from everything and are impossible to clean. My rear brakes wore prematurely at 28,000 miles. The worst part was that there was no wear indicator. Instead of hearing a predictable squeak I instead was greeted with a horrible metal-on-metal noise. Total repair charge for new pads and rotars was about 500 bucks. Finally, the biggest pet peeve is that the car squeaks like crazy. For the first 5,000 miles it was OK but now after every speed bump, corner, or sharp turn the chassis complains with groans. 

That said, the Jetta pros are considerable. It's all in the details with this car. The body styling is nice. The Monsoon system, when it isn't broken, sounds pretty good. The interior lights are cool too. The instrument panel has blue and red lights that look amazing at night. There are also lights illuminating the side door controls - a great touch when you need to open the windows or unlock the doors at night but don't want to fumble for the switch. The full size spare is a nice touch. The 1.8T is a must have as it has plenty of power and can easily be upgraded for more speed if required. Stay away from the entry-level 2.0L engine, what I term the "ghetto Jetta". Although its $18,000 sticker is attractive it just doesn't have the power the car needs. The seats are comfortable and the carpet on the floor is of good quality. The plastics and rubber inside the car have a great feel, and the switches have a comfortable tactile feel. The steering wheel feels nice - the car effortlessly goes where you want it to. The brakes are a bit touchy but they're strong. Once you get used to it they provide you with confidence.
