            I bought a 1995 Nissan Pathfinder Se new in the fall of 1995.  I wanted to buy a Toyota 4-Runner, but couldnt see paying the $28,000 they wanted for them.  It was loaded with all the goodies.  I added an aftermarket cd player, receiver hitch, and inline engine heater for those cold morning start ups.  

I owned this Nissan Pathfinder for four years before selling it last year.  My reasons for selling it were:  

         1.  Poor gas mileage (15 mpg city, 19 highway)
         2.  Safety concern:  Wasnt the best on icy highways &amp; no airbags
         3.  Wanted to sell it before the resale value dropped anymore.
         4.  Poor engine performance (150 hp V6 was severly
             underpowered.  I tow a 2 place snowmobile trailer, and needed
             more power).

I bought the Nissan Pathfinder thinking it would be the ideal vehicle for my family.  I live in Wyoming and love to hunt, fish, etc.  The winter roads in Wyoming can be treacherous and I wanted a vehicle that would be safe when my wife drove it to work and such.  What I found was the opposite.  With its wider than normal 31 &quot; tires it proved to be quite &quot;squirrely&quot; on icy highways.  And, when it came to my hunting and fishing excursions I found I did not ever want to take it since I was afraid to get it dirty!  After all SUV's are not cheap!!

I did not take my Nissan Pathfinder off road much.  95 percent of the driving was highway.  But when I did take it off road I found it to be quite capable in terms of off roading capablities.  Clearance was good compared to other SUVS. When placed in &quot;low range&quot; the speed was adequate for manuevering thru difficult areas.

When driven on the road I was less than impressed though.  Power comes via a 150 hp v6 linked to a 5 speed manual transmission.  This engine really strained when going thru hilly, mountainous country.  And with a headwind (common in Wyoming), I found myself in 4th gear more times than not, with frequent stops at gas stations.  

In terms of long term reliability, I would rate the 95 Pathfinder quite high.  I never had any major problems during the time I owned the vehicle.  I had 58,000 miles on it when I sold it last year. It still felt rock solid (no squeaks, rattles or such).  Although, the older Pathfinders w/ the VG30 and VG30E V6 engines (95 included), are succeptible to warping of the exhaust manifold at around 60,000 miles.  And the fix costs about 600-800 dollars.  From what research I had done, Nissan will not stand behind the cost to repair the damage even though it is a known design flaw. I never had this problem when I owned this Pathfinder

Now for some things I liked about my Pathfinder:
   1)  Lots of room (came in handy with the newborn)
   2)  Good looking rig! Drew alot of compliments.
   3)  Reliable
   4)  Comfortable seats

I replaced my Pathfinder w/ a four door sedan.  My wife drives 40 miles a day to work.  We needed a vehicle that got better gas mileage and had more safety features.  The sedan we got gets 27 mpg and has dual airbags and antilock brakes. And, I purchased an older model (87) full size blazer).  Now I can go hunting and fishing and not worry about trashing a $20,000 Pathfinder! 

There that is my opinion on the 1995 Nissan Pathfinder.  I found it wasnt for me, but I am sure it has a niche in someone elses garage.
