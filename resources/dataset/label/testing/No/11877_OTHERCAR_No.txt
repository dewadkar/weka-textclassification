            Help!  Any 1994 Olds Achieva owners who have had to replace a head gasket before 7 years or 100,000 miles, please contact Oldsmobile.  Oldsmobile knows that they had faulty head gaskets and are coving the cost of the repairs for 1992 and 1993 models, but our 1994 Achieva had the same problem and we feel they did not fix the problem and will not stand behind their faulty product on a 1994 model.  If you have been stuck with a large bill to repair a faulty head gasket please contact Oldsmobile.  They should be coving the 1994 models in their Special Service Bulletin.  Our 1994 Achieva has been nothing but headaches.  Numerous, major repairs have been needed--struts, alternator, brakes, power locks.<br><br>
