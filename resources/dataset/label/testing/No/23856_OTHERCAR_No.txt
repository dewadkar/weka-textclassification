            We purchased our 1990 Grand Caravan in the Fall of 1989.  We were quite pleased for the first few years.  We drove it from Houston to Lincoln for a family reunion in the summer of 1990 and were very comfortable.

The problems began around 60,000 miles (7/70000 warranties were not available).  The transmission had to be replaced.  By the time the next transmission change was due (around 130,000 miles), we decided to get a Chrysler-rebuilt replacement with a warranty.  We still had to have it replaced two more times before we got rid of the van at around 180,000 miles.  When considered along with our 1979 Plymouth Horizon which needed three transmission replacements, I feel that we have given Chrysler 20 years to get their transmissions right, and they have failed miserably.

Another chronic problem:  The &quot;boots&quot; that cover the front axles were of poor quality.  When they cracked, the front suspension usually suffered damage as a result.

We had other problems (leaking fuel lines, one A/C replacement), but the transmission issue was the reason we will never again purchase a Chrysler product.  Perhaps the merger with Daimler will bring a new level of quality to their engineering department, but for now, we're a non-Chrysler household.

An aside to the reviewer who challenged a Japanese manufacturer to duplicate a Grand Caravan:  Check out a Honda Odyssey!  Be prepared to wait, though (around 5-6 months).<br><br>
