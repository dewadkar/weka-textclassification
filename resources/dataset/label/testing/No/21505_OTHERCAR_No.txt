            my 1999 vw golf gls with a.t. has 7500 miles on it.  here are the things that have gone wrong:

1)  the little bastard sometimes doesn't shift out of park.  you have to have your foot on the brake to shift out of park or neutral, but sometimes it still won't go.  i'll have all of my weight on the brake pedal, and i'll have to wiggle and yank on the lever to get it to go.  once, i shifted into neutral at an intersection and this happened.  it took 5 seconds of panicked wiggling to get the thing into drive.  i took it into the shop, and they &quot;couldn't reproduce the problem&quot;.  to their credit, the problem hasn't recurred in the last two months.

2)  the O2 sensor went south, and had to be replaced.  see my other vw golf epinion for details.

3)  i live in fairbanks, alaska, and in the winter you have to plug your car in when it's not running.  the plug powers a heater for the engine block, the oil pan, and the battery.  my car was plugged in for two weeks while i was out of town, which should never be a problem.  i get back, turn the little bastard on, and let it run for an hour to warm up (it was -40).  when i check on it, the inside fans have shut off.  the interior is very cold, and there is a thick layer of ice inside all the windows.  none of the heater (or a.c.) controls work.  i can't find any fuse associated with these things.  so for a day i drive around, freezing half to death, scraping the inside of the windows constantly.  i made an appointment at the vw dealer, but by the next day the heater controls are working again.  i have no idea what happened.  a similar problem occurred two weeks later, this time the fans would only blow a little, sort of a pathetic little whistle.

4)  last week, the radio freaked out.  i get to work, shut of the car, and the radio stays on.  none of the buttons on the radio work, and there is no way to shut it off.  again, there is no appropriate fuse in the fuse box.  obviously, if i left the car the battery would run down.  so i drive to the vw dealer.  they have &quot;never seen anything like this&quot;.  they pull out the radio, as the fuse is on the back of it, and order me a new one.  i'm still waiting for it.  now when i stop the car, there is a weird static sound coming out of the speakers.

5)  my alternator died.  it wouldn't start this morning and i had to have it towed.  last winter, i replaced the alternator on my truck (at 165,000 mi).  i took it out, brought it to a small motor/battery place, and they rebuilt it overnight.  my truck was running the next day.  the alternator on my golf went bad after 7500 mi; a replacement has to be ordered from outside alaska.  it won't be here until monday at the earliest (today is thursday).  my brand new car is out of commission for most of a week, and the dealer won't even give me a f**king loaner.<br><br>
