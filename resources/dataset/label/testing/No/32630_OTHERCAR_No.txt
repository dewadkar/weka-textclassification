            I have a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire GT Coupe that I bought brand new.  I had previously owned a Grand Am that I loved, so I figured that since the Sunfire was also a Pontiac then it would be a good car too.  WRONG!  I don't know if it is just bad luck or what, but I only had the car a little over a year when my &quot;Check/Service Engine&quot; light and &quot;ETS Off&quot; light both popped on and stayed on.  The ETS Off signified that the Enhanced Traction System was turned off and the Check/Service Engine meant that something was wrong under the hood.  So, being under warranty still I was not very concerned and just took it back to the dealer.  I don't really recall exactly what was wrong with it, but some sensor of some sort.  Well, since that time last January, those two lights have popped back on 7 times.  They are currently on.  Each time, it has been something different, although it has always been some sort of sensor.  

The car is light-weight and dings very easily.  The paint job is already dull looking.  Keep in mind I have only had this car for 2 years.  And now my electric window on the driver side is going out.  Can you say LEMON????  I paid too much for this car to act like a Yugo.<br><br>
