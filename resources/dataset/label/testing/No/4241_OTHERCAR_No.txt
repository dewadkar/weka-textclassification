            When I first saw this car I loved it, as I did with my previous Volkswagens.  The car has an excellent interior, it is designed very nicely and has a sporty feel.

The stereo system is an eight speaker Monsoon system with a 6 disc changer and an amp in the trunk.  I don't really notice the so-called 200 watts that this car is supposed to have.  It doesn't sound as good as the sound system in the Audi TT - doesn't even touch it.  There is a lot of bass boom and the sound quality becomes heavily distorted at higher levels.

Volkswagen claims that this car (VR6 174 HP & 180 Torque) will go 0-60 MPH in 7.7 seconds, but I think it does better.  Car And Driver says 6.8 seconds - I tend to agree more with the 6.8 seconds.  This car will surely push your heads back into the headrests and keep them there.

For a GLX, Volkswagen should have added power adjustable seats... but they didn't.  The self dimming mirror in this car automatically cancels dimming when the car is put in reverse gear - try it.  The RAINtronic (rain sensing wipers) system is something that is now hard for me to do without.  I really enjoy it.  

Volkswagen has excellent upholstery, my GTI had black leather.  Volkswagen has no full leather option, Volkswagen only has lether on the seating surfaces, therefore the seatbacks, sides, headrests, and bolsters are leatherette... so in the end you don't get much leather.  If you go for Volkswagen's cloth... they have the best looking cloth options - whereas most other car companies have cloth that looks like it belongs on a floor.  

BUT BUT BUT... there's always a bad part to all the good.  My check engine light has come on more than 5 times in this car.  The car sounds like it has a severe miss, and the exhaust smells of gas and is very smoky.  The car has been in the repair shop many many times.  The car has had the center armrest replaced, the rear window washer repaired, the steering wheel replaced, and the passenger seat's leather needed mending.  

This is in no way an isolated case.  My 2000 1.8 Turbo Beetle has had an electrical short, which could have caused a huge crash on the road if I didn't act quickly enough - it was towed to the dealership the next day.  My Beetle's airbag light came on - very dangerous, and this car also has other assorted problems.

My friend Candy, she owns a 2000 Volkswagen Jetta, she's been through more than three oxygen sensors... and the car has had other assorted troubles.

My friend's boss, Jody also owns a 2000 Volkswagen Jetta - her window fell inside the door and the car was in the shop for over a week... and now she has an electrical short in her rear tail lights.

No more Volkswagen for me... not until they improve their quality.

Update - Volkswagen said they would buy the car back from me, but they never kept their promise.
