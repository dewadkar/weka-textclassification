            When I was eighteen I wanted to buy a new car.  My parents took me to the local Dodge dealership where the first car I looked at was a Dodge Neon.  I quickly test drove it and fell in love with it.  Two days later it was mine and I was so proud.  Well just one month later I started to have problems.  They started out little.  The check engine light kept coming on for no reason so I took it in to the dealership to have it checked out.  I ended up taking it in about 4 times just for that light.  In the three years that I had that car so many things had to be replaced.  Things like the blinker and the radio.  I had four radios in that car total.  I even had water leaking into the back floorboards because there was a whole in the floor of my car.  The car gave me such a headache that I was actually glad when I got rid of it.  I would not recommend anyone to buy a older model Neon.  I believe that I had so many problems because they were still new cars and they hadn't gotten all the bugs out.  The new ones probably run a lot better, I hope anyway.
