            Bought this car new in 1994, at night, in a snowstorm. I thought I was getting a champagne-colored vehicle. But when I picked it up, it was a horrible pinkish bronze color. Has to be the ugliest color Ford ever used.

What do I love? It was cheap. It's got 70+ on it and still runs pretty well. I've recently had to replace broken springs, struts, brakes, rotors, and the exhaust system, but until now, other than an electrical problem (below) it has only needed oil, gas and tires. The guy who recently worked on it said &quot;you must really love this car.&quot; To be honest, if I could afford it right now, I'd give it to the kids and get something nicer and which had a quieter ride.

Early on, I had a lot of trouble with the cooling fan rotor burning out. Then the radio would come on when the car was shut off. The fan rotor burned out three times before the dimwit mechanics at my dealership finally figured out that it was a faulty ignition, which never really shut off. Once the ignition was replaced, the electrical problems ceased. So if you think your car is possessed, have the ignition checked.

I wouldn't buy another one just because I'm ready to move on. Our first Escort ('81) was a fiasco. We only bought another one because it was cheap and the dealership is close by.
