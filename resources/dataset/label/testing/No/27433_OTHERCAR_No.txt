            I thought I was buying a nice car for my daughter, boy was I wrong. The car looks good and drives ok but it is forever having little quirky problems. Never have I had some many little problems with any car. First the AC went fixed that then the altenator, next the radio....it goes on and on. The car is no longer under warranty and again the AC is out and the radio doesn't work. Everyone in the family hates it....

HISTORY OF PROBLEMS

AC failed twice, still not working
Paint faded badly on drivers side quarter panel
Radio failed
Brake have been replace three times still spongy
Spings weak, car bottoms out with more than two people
Air Compressor Froze

RECOMENDATION

Steer clear of this automobile, cute doesn't cut it. You will do nothing but spend money and time fixing problems. This is the worst car I have ever owned.<br><br>
