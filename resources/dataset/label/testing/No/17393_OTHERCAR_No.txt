            Well the time has finally come to put the 1987 Honda Accord to sleep.  It was a great car and I loved every minute of owning it but it was beginning to nickle dime me and the expression "cars in Canada don't wear out, they rust out" was true. Thus, I had no choice but to go into the market to find new car.

The 2002 Volvo V60 is a fine automobile. The styling is bold and distinctive. It makes a statement when seen either from the front or the back and could never be mistaken for one of the generic curved designs now coming out of both the U.S. and Japanese manufacturers. The acceleration is excellent, the ergonomics superb, the seats incredibly comfortable and the handling is fantastic.  There are a few weaknesses in terms of a small back seat, an obstructed view due to the C pillar when making shoulder checks and a poorly designed stereo system which lacks push buttons to choose favorite radio channels. The option list is long and I believe the manufacturer would be better served by packaging the most desirable options with the base car. These are minor points.  Having owned a Volvo V70 for the last three years, I have learned to appreciate the Volvo as a fine driving machine.  There were some initial problems with recurrent replacement of the headlights and a seized lock on the tailgate but these were all fixed by Volvo and now the vehicle seems to be doing well.

However, despite the fact that the Volvo V60 is an excellent automobile, I opted for the Camry XLE V6 (report in associated section to follow).

This is a prime example of where little things count.  The number of dealerships in Ottawa area that can fix my Camry are six. There is only one Volvo dealership with two sites in town.  The Toyota dealership has a program wherein they are open until after midnight for late-night repairs.  The Volvo dealership requires you to make appointments.  The Toyota dealer offers loaners for major repairs. The Volvo dealer doesn't. Recently, I brought my Volvo in for an oil change and had to wait 90 minutes for the vehicle to be done.  Compounding this was the fact that for a 24,000 mile check, the car was in all day.  This just does not cut it for me when I have more things to do than wander around a show room waiting for my car to be done. Finally, the repairs and maintenance costs of the Volvo are substantially higher than the corresponding costs on the Camry. This cost differential is particularly likely to increase as the cars age as a result of the projected superior reliability of the Toyota.

Arguably, the Volvo may be safer with its whiplash seats.  However, both vehicles have side airbags and curtains as well as front airbags and crumple zones.  In the last few years, the other automobile manufacturers have upgraded the safety features on their vehicles and, I believe, are approaching and have in some cases surpassed the safety features of the Volvo.  However, beware about buying a car like a Volvo which has a limited market, limited dealership support and expensive repair and maintenance costs. Sorry Volvo, this time I'm going with Toyota.
