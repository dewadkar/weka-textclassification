            I agree with the great number of writers in this category who love their 626.  We bought ours new in 1995 and have really enjoyed it in many ways: We got more car for the money than we would have with any other import, it is snazzy looking, and has a great record for reliability.

However, I've got some gripes.  First of all, I get nowhere near the EPA mileage estimates in town and that is disappointing.  Also, the fit and finish just doesn't match up to say a Toyota or a Honda.  There are too many little squeaks and rattles.  Also, we've had a number of minor problems during the warranty period and one major problem right after the warranty gave out.  During the warranty period we've had to replace one of the rear right tail lamps 3 times, we've had to get the mirror glued back on, and we've had at least one manufacturer's recall.

These minor hassles are hardly worth mentioning except for the fact of the major hassle:  just 10,000 miles out of warranty, the transmission had a major meltdown.  I've treated this car like a baby.  I've carefully followed all of the manufacturer's recommendations for service.  I've used only Mobil One as the oil.  I even had the transmission fluid changed once and checked on several occasions.  And it broke down.

The dealership wouldn't really help me out, although the factory theoretically paid enough to make my repair just about the same as if I would have taken it to an independent shop.  They didn't really even have a good explanation of why the transmission broke down.

I'll never buy a Mazda again.
