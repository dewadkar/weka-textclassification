            I got a 97' Dodge Neon Highline Sport, very cool looking with the spoiler. I even had a pre-buyers inspection done at the family auto shop, and they said it was in the best condition they had seen come in their shop.As far as initial performance goes, this car handles curves and turns better than i would have thought, and the interior was roomy, too (i'm really tall, and it was the only car that had enough leg room). I also like the 'trap doors' into the trunk from the back seat. It gets GREAT gas. Acceleration is so so. It has a decent sound system and quick AC. After only a few months i started having TERRIBLE problems....my electrical system went haywire- the door ajar light wouldnt go off (and is STILL ON to this day), dome light wont go ON, and random 'ding' noises like the door is open, but its not. THEN other problems started happening....my brother is a mechanic and i ALWAYS got the oil changed on time and the fluids checked. well, to start off, my ignition switch went bad. then my air conditioning. then the power steering pump. then the transmission went bad and i had to get a total overhaul. my thermostat broke because my fan just stopped coming on and my car overheated. Then my fan wouldnt go OFF, so of course my battery needed replacing. I have gone through 4 batteries in the past 1.5 years. Thank GOD for warranties.
