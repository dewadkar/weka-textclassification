            Bought this car at a state Auction in November At first I loved it, good gas mileage, only paid 8 bucks for a full tank of gas that would last me 250 mi or more, acceleration is a little slow but once it hit 50 picks up,european car feel. Everthing was going well that is until I started having problems with the car. First the paint...it seems the Primer is bad so the Paint peels and it not under any type of warrenty from Chrysler. Cost about $1200 dollars at Maaco to sand the car down and apply new primer paint and clear coat (4 days). It's a great commuter car though if your driving in state. I went on a recent road trip to Vermont big mistake. First problem I had was with the A/C the car turned off on me on I-87 major interstate in upstate NY. Let the car cool off and the car re-started. Check engine light was on till I got to VT and put Some Super into the car...Light went off??? Major electrical problems. Sometimes the dash doesn't come on so you have to hit the top of it to work. This is not a good highway car....It fishtails at speeds above 55...and is all over the road. Extremly loud, noises rattles and other problems. Sometimes you can hear popping from the suspension (supposively normal). Visibilty sucks at night and during any type of bad weather, head lights are inadeqate. Not a good car for tall people, (6'0 and above) seats are uncomfortable in long rides. Stereo sucks, Factory speakers are decent and easy to replace. On to bigger problems, My head gasket is leaking...est. $500-800 dollars to fix...this will be the second one on this car....and is a frequent problem with these cars.
I bought the car with 75000 miles on it it has about 86000 (11,000 miles driven) miles on it.  Great for driving to work and back...but wouldn't recommend it for college students who have far to travel, car is high matnince and very expensive to fix....with all it's crappy electrical problems. Buy another Dodge but don't buy NEON'S.
