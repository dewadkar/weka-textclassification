               Last weekend I picked up a small digital camera and I went off in the hopes that I would be the next great digital sharpshooter of the 21st Century. Well that went all out the door as soon as I opened the box.

   Usually Minolta is really great with their products, yet this time I have to say back to the drawing board. This little camera makes the CA power shortage look small. This thing will suck the juice out of the batteries as soon as you put then in there. Well, not all that fast, but the time allowed to take photos is not very long at all. Downside!!

   When you are looking to view your pictures, again you are going to wait. This thing takes too long to transfer the pictures from the memory to your computer. Even through the USB connection. 

   As for the software that is included, I had to install it on a friend�s computer to see them. If you can�t load the program, you�re screwed. It's too bad that one cant try to install the program first and ensure that it is going to work first.  I was forced to go to COMP USA and purchase a USB connector that was able to read the camera�s memory stick and go that route�.shame shame shame Minolta.

   It�s a good little camera in the long run, but with all the downsides, I will have to say that there are better choices out there.

   If you have any other questions, feel free to E-mail me at mcaanda@yahoo.com and I will reply as soon as I possibly can. 
Thanx!! Mcaanda
