            I am sure that the ACURA CL is a great car, as with all ACURAS.  However, I have seen these driving around for a while now, and I just don't like the way they look at all!  Now I realize that they are a pretty good value, I mean here you have a semi-luxury car that will run forever, for under $30,000.  But I find the body style too simple.  There is just one main line through the whole body of the car(from bumper to bumper).  I think this makes this car look cheap and unattractive.  It is important to like the body style of the car you purchase and I just don't understand why these are becoming more and more popular.  THANK YOU!<br><br>
