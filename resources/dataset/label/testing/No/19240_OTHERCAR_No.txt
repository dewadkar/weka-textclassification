            I got a new 1997 Dodge Intrepid as a company car in December of 1996.  I then bought the car in October of the following year when I left my position with the company.  It was probably the worst decision I've made!

The anti-lock brakes push back at your foot so hard it actually kicks your foot off the pedal.  I could pump the brakes a lot faster than this automatic system does.

The tie rods in the front have been replaced twice now and the car only has 85,000 miles on it.  The water pump has already been replaced as well as the timing belt.  The tape deck quit working 3 months after I got the car new.  The gas mileage is terrible -- usually under 20 miles per gallon.  All of the seals inside the doors have had to be re-glued.  The windshield wipers don't work very well at all if there is any wind.  There is a lot of wind noise in the cabin as well.

We've been lucky so far in that the transmission hasn't gone out -- I've heard from several Intrepid owners that the transmission usually goes out at about 70,000 miles.

The only thing I like about the car is the interior room.  There's plenty of leg room in the back seat and the back seat is big enough to hold 3 carseats.<br><br>
