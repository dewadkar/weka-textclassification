            2000 Geo Metro-Poor Designed

I recently rented a 2000 Geo Metro, because my wife crashed our Toyota Corolla.
This car, while cute to look at is an auto designer joke. The car has very poor pick up and if you turn on the air conditioner, forget you are going to have to really press down on the gas to get the car to move. It's sluggish any way whether the air conditioner is on or off.
The designer I believe is a combination of Toyota and Chevrolet, and these guys must have been laughing really hard when they were conceiving this car. The steering wheel
Sits a little to high and you can't adjust it. The vents blow the air right in your face and turning the vent in another direction will make you feel as if the AC is not even on. The controls for the radio and blower are located in a very poor location, especially the radio
The problem was I could not change the station or the volume with out looking down.
The parking brake light would be lit on the dash board eventhough the brake was in the down position, so I had to reseat the parking brake, in order for the light to go off. The seat are a little uncomfortable for me, and I'm 5 feet 8 inches, so image a person 6'2 or more.  The ride was bumpy and noisy. And with the back of the car in a high position
Parking took some getting used to. Finally if you going to use the AC prepare to fill up your car again.
This car had just 2500 miles on it, and I had the car for 10 days
