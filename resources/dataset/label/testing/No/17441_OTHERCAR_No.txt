               I HAVE ALWAYS OWNED HONDA CARS, ACCORDS & CIVICS.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE CARS OR THE SERVICE IN HONDA.  WHEN I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD A NEW PASSPORT I JUMPED RIGHT ON IT.
   IN 1999 I PURCHASED A PASSPORT EX V6 WITH ALL THE BELLS & WHISTLES.  I LOVED IT!!!! IS WAS LIKE MY DREAM CAR AND EVERYTHING WAS GREAT.  THE PASSPORT HAS A LOT OF POWER AND SEEMS TO BE VERY STABLE.
   A YEAR AFTER I HAD IT I NOTICED THAT IT WAS GETTING HARDER TO STOP, THE CAR FELT LIKE IT WANTED TO KEEP GOING.  THEN I NOTICED THAT AFTER BEING AT A C0MPLETE STOP WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS THE CAR WOULD ACCELERATE BY ITSELF ALL THE WAY UP THE 40 MPH - WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO HONDA ABOUT THIS THEY JUST SAID THAT "THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, COME BACK LATER".
   AFTER DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM FOR MONTHS, IT FINALLY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT, THANKFULLY NO ONE WAS HURT BUT HONDA STILL WOULD NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY EVEN THOUGH I HAD REPORTED THIS PROBLEM TO THEM 4 TIMES!  THEY SAID IT'S ISUZU NOT A HONDA ENGINE - I DIDN'T CARE IF THEY SOLD ME THE CAR, AND PUT THEIR NAME ON IT THEY SHOULD STAND BEHIND THEM.  
   I ALSO HAVE TALKED TO AT LEAST 7 PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS.
   NEEDLESS TO SAY I NO LONGER OWN A HONDA!!!
   F.Y.I. THE NEW HONDA PASSPORTS ARE NOW HAVING HONDA ENGINES AND I AM SURE ARE VERY NICE CARS.
