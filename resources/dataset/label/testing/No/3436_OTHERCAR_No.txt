            I have a problem. I change cars like I change my clothes, and it�s starting to get embarrassing. I have friends that call me every so often and ask me what car I�m driving that month. Since 1998, I�ve driven, in this order, a 1989 Nissan Pathfinder, a 1996 Volvo 850R, a 1998 Range Rover 4.6HSE, a 1999 Mercedes E320, a 1970 Mercedes 280SL, a 2001 Acura 3.2 CL S-type, and my current car, a 2000 Porsche Boxster S. I fully expect most of you to look at that list and think that I must be some incredible jerk, but in my defense, of those seven vehicles, four of them were obtained for justifiable, or at least understandable, reasons.

For clarity, I'll sum up why I went through seven cars in three years. The Pathfinder died. I needed a truck, so I traded in the Volvo for the Range Rover, which was a complete lemon.  California's Lemon Law got me out of the Range Rover and in to the E320, which was OK. One day I drove by a mint 280SL convertible at a vintage car lot, so adios to the E320. The 280SL was stolen, but I had fallen in love with driving a convertible, so I got the Boxster. You can read my Boxster review here on Epinions.

Which brings us to the Acura. I work in the entertainment industry and live on both coasts. I needed a vehicle to keep at my house outside New York City because my girlfriend was getting tired of me driving her Tahoe into the ground. I wasn�t about to ship the Porsche out East because of the rust potential and the fact that you can only drive with the top down about 4 months per year, plus, I needed a car in both LA and New York. I decided to buy a car that had a good rust warranty and was sporty yet practical for use in the Northeast�s brutal winters. 

After driving everything under the sun, I settled on two cars: the Audi S4 and the BMW 330Ci. Of the two, the Audi was by far my favorite, but I couldn�t justify spending almost $50K. I liked the handling of the BMW quite a bit and was actually all set to buy one until I read an article in Motortrend that put the BMW up against an Acura. When I first saw the article, I didn�t give it much thought because, as anybody knows who reads Motortrend, C&D or Road and Track, BMW is the darling of the magazines. They wouldn�t dare let an Acura beat a BMW, would they? I then decided to go back and actually read the test, and I�ll be darned if Motortrend didn�t show the Acura besting the BMW on almost all counts! That, combined with the fact that the Acura is almost $10K cheaper than the BMW, made me stand up and take real notice of the 3.2. An Acura with 260 horsepower? Front-wheel drive to help get me through the snow? Navigation system? All for only $32K? It sounded too good to be true!

I was back in LA a few days later and decided to go to an Acura dealership and check out this upstart 3.2 for myself. For whatever reason, Acura had decided to release the 2001 model year in April of 2000. The 2000 model year was skipped, so the only cars on the lot were a pair of 2001�s, one black and one silver. I swore that I�d never own another black car (the E320 was black), so I told the salesman to grab the keys to the silver car.


The first major thing I noticed about the 3.2 was the simple yet functional interior. Acura thought of absolutely everything when designing this car. The nice thing about the S-type is that there is only one option: navigation. Otherwise, the car is fully loaded. The all-leather driver and passenger seats are heated, fully automatic and very comfortable. Ergonomically, the car is laid out extremely well. Audio and cruise controls are on the steering wheel, and all other controls are easy to see and reach. There are, in effect, two glove boxes. There is one in the standard location and another between the two back seats, which is handy because it�s lockable and most valet people wouldn�t know that it even existed. 

The sound system in the Acura consists of an in-dash six-disc changer, AM/FM radio and cassette. I hate trunk-mounted CD changers, so the Acura's in-dash system is heaven-sent for me. If you've read any of my other reviews, you know by now that I record and mix albums and film scores for a living, and I'm here to tell you that Acura did one heck of a job with this audio system. It sounds really good! 

The Acura�s interior is very roomy for a car that�s classified as a compact. In contrast, the BMW 3-series is actually classified as a sub-compact, and if you sit in the Acura after sitting in the BMW, you will surely notice the difference. As they say, the Acura�s interior was well-appointed.

The next thing I noticed about the 3.2 was it�s excellent acceleration. While not heavy on the torque, it gets you up to speed very quickly. Honda�s V-6 260-horsepower V-TEC is an outstanding motor and has a top speed of 147 miles per hour. Braking is superb, and the handling is also excellent for a front-wheel drive car. I much prefer rear-wheel drive, but the Acura performed nicely with only minor noticeable understeer. Of course, the turning radius was lousy, but I don�t really care about that very much. 

One bummer is that Acura doesn�t make a version of the 3.2 with a manual transmission. The sequential shifting is nice, even better than BMW�s Steptronic, but not as good as Porsche�s Tiptronic. None of these systems are a substitute for the real deal, though, and I think Acura blew it by not providing a manual transmission. The Acura�s suspension was very nice and provides a very smooth ride as well, which actually is one of the problems I had with car. Read on�

As I said, the Acura had a very smooth ride. It was so smooth that at times I felt a detachment to the road, which I don�t like. I like to feel what the car is doing, and I don�t get much of that from the 3.2. Interior noise is very low as well, even furthering your detachment from the road. Plus, the hood is angled so low that you can�t see it from the driver�s position. You look out and all you see is road, which to me is distracting. I like to see what the car is doing in relation to the road.

As fun as the car is to drive, there were some issues that made me rather dislike the vehicle after a few months of driving it. The big issue for me was the Acura�s bland styling. There is nothing interesting about the Acura�s body, which I thought I wouldn�t mind, but after a while it really started to bother me. I don�t like the fact that the 3.2 looks like about 30 other cars currently on the road. And what�s up with that trunk? Is it me, or is that bubble on the back of the trunk really ugly? Well, at least it�s better than the earlier version of the CL. That was hideous.

The interior started to give me problems as well. Don�t get me wrong, the Japanese do things very well in terms of providing all the bells and whistles under the sun, but the car lacks a soul. I felt nothing when driving this car, and that�s important. I like to feel like the car has a soul, and the Acura has none. When I would travel back to LA and drive the Mercedes (up until it was stolen) or the Porsche, I get an exhilaration that I never got out of the Acura. Those cars are just that, cars. The Acura is simply a mode of transportation, and that�s it.

In Acura�s defense, I will say that the navigation system is by far the best I�ve ever seen in a car. It is extremely easy to use and understand. After I bought the Acura, I drove the vehicle from LA to New York, and the navigation system tracked me the whole way without ever getting lost. I took some pretty small back roads, and it found them all. When I arrived in New York, I tried to fool it a few times, but it always got the best of me. It is an absolutely excellent system, but be careful� I found my self watching it and not the road on more than a few occasions. Also, unless you really need it or plan to use it for work, the navigation system can get gimmicky after a while. After about two weeks, I left it off because the novelty had worn off and I never really needed it.

In retrospect, I appreciate Acura for it�s commitment to providing a well-made vehicle at a low price, but I wish I had looked further and perhaps given the BMW stronger consideration. All around, the Acura is a vehicle that will provide years of worry-free transportation, but that�s it. If you want a car that you�ll look forward to driving every day for years, I don�t think the Acura 3.2 CL-S is for you. If you want a vehicle that will get you from point A to point B a little bit quicker than some other cars will, without getting you lost, then the 3.2 is for you.
