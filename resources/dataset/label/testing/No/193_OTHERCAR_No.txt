            The 2000 Isuzu Rodeo has been nothing but problems since the day we drove it out of the dealer's parking lot.  This Sport Utility Vehicle looks nice on the outside, a true horror in disguise.

This is our family's first SUV, coming from always owning a car, it made the transformation to the SUV a bit difficult.  The ride is not smooth and bumps in the road are not easy on the driver and his or her passengers.  The height of the vehicle is substantial enough with less body surrounding you.  

Two weeks after we purchased the vehicle the CD player needed to be repaired.  The CD's were unable to eject, after getting it back from being repaired, I found out that even if working properly, it is temperamental.  The CD player also does not play CD's that have been burned on the computer, if injected it will wreck the whole CD system.

One month later the head gaskets on this vehicle blew, something which is uncalled for a brand new vehicle.  After putting up a fight, Isuzu provided us with a rental car, which Isuzu is against and is not normally provided.

One month after, the truck began to stall without any indication.  We drive back and forth from New Jersey to Long Island, NY, the truck kept on stalling on major busy highways.  When we returned home we explained to the dealership, Maroon Pontiac/ Kia in Wayne, NJ, about the problem and again they took it in for more repairs for two weeks.  

The problems still have not been resolved, they constantly do work on the truck, only to give it back to us and the same problems arise again and again.  The truck has been in for the same problems a total of 32 times.  Recently, it has started to smoke up for no apparent reason.

We brought it in once again and they replaced the starter.  They rotated the tires and gave it back to us.  The problem still was not solved.  We asked to meet with the Isuzu Headquarters in person to back out of the lease, but they said there is nothing they could do about the truck.  Isuzu was nothing more then uncaring and not accommodating.

The interior is less then average and the the console looks cheaply made.

The pros of this vehicle a few, but are definitely nice. The SUV is great for tailgating, a feature they pride the truck on.  It is terrific for transporting stuff to and from locations, due to the amount of space available to store things.  The back seats collapse fully down, allowing more space if needed.  

We are now in the process of declaring Lemon Law and hope for the best.  I would not recommend this SUV to anyone.
