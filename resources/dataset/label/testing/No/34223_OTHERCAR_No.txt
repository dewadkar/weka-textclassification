            A long time ago, I bought a 1985 Nissan Sentra that was gun-metal gray and had absolutely zero style.  What it did, however, was provide years of fairly reliable driving of peppy acceleration and tight cornering.  She finally went away at 186,000 miles, and though friends used to ask me when I would get a �cool� car, I was quite happy with my little gray runabout.  

Fast forward to a business trip through the mountains of New Mexico and the 2000 Toyota Solara.  Let�s start with the praise first:  the car looks cool.

Unfortunately, it climbs hills like a wheezing out-of-shape executive, accelerates about as fast as a good sprinter and has the cornering radius of a tractor-trailer.  At the bottom line, it�s a Camry with some nice styling and features like cruise control and tilt steering.

Because this was only a one-week rental (albeit a week with 500+ miles), I can�t speak to reliability.  I can, however, share with you some of the pros and cons.   Remember too, that what we�re talking about is really a dressed up (and supposedly souped-up) Camry.  Camrys tend to be great cars.  The Solara is not a great car, but that maybe because it whispers quietly to you that it is functional and cool.

<b>INSIDE</b> - The car is pretty quiet inside and gives the feeling of a larger four door instead of this two door sporty thing it�s purported to be.  The aforementioned cruise and tilt wheel were here, as was a really nice stereo system with CD and cassette.  The stereo controls were a bit cumbersome and required scrolling through various attributes, but if that�s the worst I can say about it, then it was a pretty good stereo overall.  The dash cluster is a bit odd in that the height of the seat and wheel make that tilt steering a necessity.  Give it a 3 � out of 5 possible and move on to 

<b> PERFORMANCE</b> - Yow!  The trades say zero to 60 in 8 seconds.  Maybe they tested downhill.    The basic engine is a 4 cylinder, 2.2 liters with 135 horsepower.  I understand there�s a 6 cylinder version out, but haven�t seen results yet.  Given my experience with the four, however, I would urge a prospective buyer to definitely consider an upgrade.  This one gets 2 stars.  And yes, I know about fuel mix at high altitude.  2 stars.

<b>FUEL ECONOMY</b>  - Here�s a bit of an oxymoron.  Fuel usage is hardly economical, particularly considering the engine.  Those horses are straining pretty badly.  I thought the issue might be my particular car so I checked out the stats.  This beastie is only rated at 30 mpg highway � and it�s a four cylinder with no power!  Of course, your mileage will vary, and given all the aerodynamic styling and other hoo-haa, one would expect more.  2 stars as well for this category.

Overall we have a car here that doesn�t know if it wants to be a sporty or practical car.  Mixing attributes from both didn�t work for the Solara; instead, the car seems to be getting the worst of each side.  You can buy a 2000 Honda Accord now, get a little more power and sacrifice some style.  The cars run about the same (not the 2001s, but the 2000s) and you�ll get the pedigree of the Accord, one of America�s most popular vehicles.

Families don't need to be even looking at this vehicle.  Getting into the back seat is a chore and the trunk size is nothing special.  A two income childless couple couple who does most of their driving in the city may enjoy the car, but that's about the only group I can picture doing so.

Me?  I�m looking for a mid 1980s Sentra driven by a little old lady from Pasadena.  Give me anything but cool again.
