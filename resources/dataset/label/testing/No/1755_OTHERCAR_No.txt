            I really wasn't looking to buy a Mazda but I wanted a newer car, and since the one I owned was a used Mazda 323, I thought I would get a good deal at the Mazda dealer. I liked the style of the Mazda and the dealer was willing to work with me on the financing, so I ended up buying a 1995 Mazda 626. 

I have actually enjoyed owning my Mazda, in spite of the rattling sound, which I am told by a mechanic is standard for the Mazda so no need for alarm. It handles the road pretty good and it's enough room for my girls and me. I haven't had any major problems until recently. I am having to replace my transmission, which doesn't sit too well with me since I'm still paying for it. 

In my opinion 5 years is too soon for major repairs. You can not get just any mechanic to service a Mazda transmission, a lot of them won't touch it - too complicated, so the maintenance is expensive. I am a single parent and very furious that I am faced with such expensive repairs at this time. I'm not in a position to trade so I'm stuck with paying $3,000 to get the transmission replaced.  

There have also been two recalls on my Mazda in the 4yrs I've had it (1 for the air bag, and 1 for the gas cap).  I wish they would recall the transmission...or better yet, the whole car!<br><br>
