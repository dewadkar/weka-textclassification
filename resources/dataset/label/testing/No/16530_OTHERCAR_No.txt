            I leased my Jetta because my grandparents only purchased Volkswagens and swore by them.  I loved the car for the first year I drove it.  I thought it drove well and was very comfortable.   About a year and a half into the lease, however, it all started.  The first thing to go was my alternator.  I lost power while driving on the parkway and thankfully was able to get out of the flow of traffic safely.  Since then I have replaced all of the moldings on the car once and currently have 2 missing because I refuse to keep paying for them and Volkswagen will not assist.  I have also had to replace the rear passenger window motor. (even though it had rarely been used).  Recently I have had to replace the ignition switch twice.  The latest nightmare is the locks.  The drivers side lock does not work all the time and sometimes when I use it the alarm will go off and I cannot get it to stop.  
I am extremely disappointed with my Jetta.  I never now what is going to happen next.  I will not buy or lease another Volkswagen.  I had a Honda before this for 6 years and 130,000 miles and only had to have normal maintenance performed.  This car has been a money pit for me.  <br><br>
