            We have owned a dodge since '97, and it has been a very dependable truck.  It is a half ton two wheel drive with a 318.  The only thing that I found I didn't like is the parts are very expensive, and they are very eager to get your truck into service so they can charge you the $50.00 for the diagnostic. I wanted to change the fuel filter on it and it was a $150.00 for the filter. I work on trucks(the big ones) every day and every where I call they are more than happy to help me solve a problem so I don't have to bring the truck in.  Not with Dodge.  Also my boss has a '96 fwd 3/4 ton with a diesel engine and we have change the transmission for times.  And he ordered the truck with the heavy towing package.<br><br>
