            The new, larger Saturn is a good looking car.  It looks big without being huge.  Interior room is adequate but much better than the smaller SC line of cars.  The controls are well placed and make sense, they also lack that cheap plastic-y feel typical of many General Motors cars. Stereo sounds very good, not great but very good, still better than the stereo found in Corolla, AccordLX, CamryLE, and Taurus. Adequate rear seat leg room (I am 6'1) and a nice big trunk. The Seats are just OK

The fun stops when the car starts, much more time should have been spent on refining that rough GM inline 4-cylinder engine - eek! While the power is OK, the engine lacks the refinement found inside the car. At highway speed the engine is rather buzzy, you may feel a little more tired at the end of a long trip. Get the V-6, it is worth the extra money. 

Although the ride can be a bit choppy at times, the European influenced Opel platform on which the Saturn L series in built makes it downright fun to drive at times.  Handling is very good. It will make  freeway on-ramps fun. 

Of course money is what it's all about. Everyone wants a bargain. By the time you add the options you want (V-6) the Saturn L series starts to get a bit pricey.  For around $20,000 you could have a base Camry with one of the smoothest 4 cylinder engines in the world, or a REALLY nice used car. 

Owning a Saturn has never really been just about the car. It's an experience, owner B-B-Q's, cult status and the uniqueness of the car may be enough to win some new loyal owners<br><br>
