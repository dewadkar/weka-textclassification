             My wife purchased our 96 Grand Caravan SE in 1998 from a leasing company that provided vehicles to her company. They offered it to us for $8000.00 and we couldn't pass it up. It performed well for two years and now has 88K miles on it. This past summer the ac went south, though not un-expected for the Caravan. I simply recharge it myself and will wait until it seizes to replace it. The transmission is bump shifting and will grind or slip slightly between first and second gear. This problem is aggravated by using transmission fluid other than Chrysler. ATF-3 will ruin this transmission, but I may have found out to late. I was told the transmission was adapted from the little Plymouth Horizons and is not sturdy enough for a heavy van. The clock spring went out in the steering column this summer and it is a $250 fix unless I do it myself. Since it involves the air bag it can be dangerous to replace. This clock spring has also disabled my horn and cruise control. I have had good luck with the brakes, only replacing them once in 38k miles. I put NAPA ceramic pads on and they perform much better. The van now has a lot of thumps and body knocks, some due to worn struts, I think, and the sliding doors not shutting properly or worn. We suffered with a leaking passenger door that the dealer still cannot fix. There was also a strong odor of gasoline at road speed that I couldn't locate. After two trips to the dealer they finally replaced a "roll over valve" that was a recall item. I have looked at and priced other vans and I still like the Caravan. I just hope they get the mechanical bugs out and then I will probably buy another 2001 Dodge after I see the reviews here.
