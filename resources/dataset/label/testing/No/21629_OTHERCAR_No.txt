            I purchased a 1994 JEEP Grand Cherokee Limited demo car in 1994.  I wanted an SUV, for the 1st time, and thought these were the prettiest ones.  However, I did not do my homework.  I was quite satisfied with the Jeep for the 1st few months, accept that it got terrible gas mileage.  Mine was a V8 with 4WD and cost more than a car payment in gas per month.  Then, the real trouble started when I tried to drive it to NY to visit family.  On my way back from NY, the &quot;drive train&quot; fell off and left me stranded in some backwoods town that did not even have a nearby airport.  I called the dealership I purchased the vehicle from and they decided to send someone with a flat-bed truck to pick up my car and have it fixed at their dealership instead of sending it to a closer repair shop and me having to wait on it, which sounded like a good idea in the beginning.  But, after a long bus ride home, I changed my mind.  Well, to make a long story short, Jeep blamed me for 80% of the problem for taking my long trip (isn't that what cars are for, to drive?) and after making me pay for the tow truck, his expenses, my expenses and what they wanted me to pay to have it fixed, i decided to sell it back to them and ended up loosing the cost of a small vehicle on the whole ordeal.  But, I guess I just have to say we learn from our mistakes and I should have done my homework. <br><br>
