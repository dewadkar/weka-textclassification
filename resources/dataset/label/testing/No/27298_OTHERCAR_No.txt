            Durango, Faulty ABS, Bad Brakes. Accident-prone.

I have never caused an accident in over 20 years until I owned a Durango. I�ve owned/driven dozens of other SUV�s and cars and have never experienced brakes as soft as those on the Durango. I�ve also driven Class �C� type vehicles that all had better braking capabilities then this even when loaded. The problem lies directly with the ABS setup in the vehicle.

Since owning the 2000 Dodge Durango, I have caused 2 rear-end collisions. 

The first collision was when I was following a motorist about 50 feet behind doing about 30 MPH. He stopped suddenly because of traffic ahead of him (unbeknown to me because of the size of his vehicle) and I stopped as fast as I could by pressing the brake peddle down ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. The ABS kicked in and the TRUCK just simply Would Not Stop. It slowed gradually until I collided with the vehicle. 

Since this accident I came to realize that the ABS on the Durango simply is too soft at bringing a vehicle to a panic stop on dry pavement. Therefore, I had to re-train my driving habits by providing a larger breaking distance between the vehicle in front of me and myself in order to avoid these accidents in the future. It has since changed my habits in all driving conditions from Highway to Rural Driving. 

The second accident happened this morning. I was traveling in traffic at about 50mph approaching a tollbooth merging over to the I-Pass Lanes (automatic lanes). Once in the I-Pass lane I became aware of a Toyota Camry at a complete stop ahead of me trying to merge back into the manual lanes. I stopped as fast as I could by pressing the brake peddle down ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. The ABS kicked in and the TRUCK just simply Would Not Stop. It slowed gradually until I collided with the vehicle. She was taken away on a backboard by an ambulance. In retrospect, there was nothing I could do to avoid the accident save driving into the concrete barrier. Obviously the driver of the Camry was at fault for being in an express I-Pass lane illegally without an I-Pass device either by ignorance or by attempting to bypass the tollbooth queues. However, I should have been able to stop the vehicle with the amount of braking room provided. 

The airbags failed to deploy on both instances. 

I will call Chrysler at 1-800-992-1997 to file a complaint.
I will now have my brakes inspected for potential defects.
I will not buy a Durango again.
I will not by a vehicle with only 2 wheel ABS again.

I advise everybody thinking of purchasing a Durango to �Panic Stop Test� the vehicle prior to purchase in order to judge it�s braking capabilities with that what you are used to.

I advise everybody to test their brakes, regardless of what vehicle you own, at a panic stop in a parking lot or rural road in order to judge it�s braking capabilities, especially if you drive a Durango or a 2 wheel ABS vehicle.
 
The environmental controls on this vehicle is similar to a cut and dry pickup truck. Hot, Cold, and Blow. Very Noisy. Little control. NO FRESH AIR. A true K-Car.

Front seats lack head rests so long trips are out unless you scrunch down. The seats also don't hold you on the turn's as other bucket seats do.

My truck averages 13.6 MPG on every tank. A little better on trips, 14.7.
