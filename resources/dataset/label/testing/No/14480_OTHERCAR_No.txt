            Here's the history. Summer of 1994, fresh out of Basic Training, I had a ton of money to spend. My Dad works at Chrysler, so we got the discount. We bought a 1994 White Le Baron GTC Convertible. 
Stats: 141 hp, 171 lbs/ft. Note: Quick and nimble, faster than you'd think. I once had it up to 210 km/h (125+ mph) Very stable.

The problems didn't arise until after I had the car for a while. 
Problem #1) Motor Mounts. Going over railroad tracks, they just sort of went 'thump'. Covered under warranty. In the shop for a week.
Problem #2) Complete Explosion of Transmission. Driving down the road, under non abuse conditions, at about 30mph, the car felt like the engine fell out of the car. Every system on the car went dead. Chrysler did not want to cover it, claiming abuse. We got a tech to check the tires: 'No abuse' he said. After placing ads in the paper, we discovered a MASSIVE conspiracy. Dozens, and dozens of calls came in. Didn't matter what car, but always the 3.0 L V-6 tranny. Chrysler hadn't admitted fault with any. They finally covered it, just to get us to stop the ads. Shop: 3 mos.
Problem #3) Convertible Top Failure. This one was probably my fault. On a crisp, cold night, I tried to put the top down. There's a motor on each side that pulls, and one froze. The other kept pulling, severely twisting the frame of the top. On trying to fix it, it ripped the glass rear window out of the top. Again, they didn't want to claim fault, but there was nothing in the manual saying not to lower it under a certain temp, so they did. Shop time: 2mos.

These things may sound awful, but on the plus side, the car was probably the most fun car I will ever drive. When it worked, it was perfect. It flew, got great gas mileage, looked great, and felt right. The leather was great, as was the CD Infinity stereo. We got it with every option available, and it was worth it. Not to mention, nothing beats top-down summer driving, with your girl at your side. Mentioning the interior: first rate. The seats were very sporty and comfortable, with full adjustablility, and ours had the inflatable lumbar. There was just something that looked right about this car with the top down. No spoilers, no gimmicks, just a nice, clean shape. The Sebring looks terrible in comparison. Cab forward cars look great, but horrible with the top down.

Back to the Le Baron. For the prices they're going for now, you can't beat it, just make sure you have a 1st car handy in case of break down. It would be a great car to buy your teenager. White is definitly recommended. We looked at other colours, but none seemed to fit.

Eventually it was a drunk driver hitting me from behind that killed the car, but I wasn't hurt. *The car also has airbags from '92 up, dual from '94 up*
