            We bought this loaded vehicle brand new in 1990.  It looked terrific!!  Buick was being recognized as a high quality American vehicle at the time.  Just in case, we bought and extended warranty (good thing we did).  It has been in and out of the shop so many times, I had lost count.  Repairs are soooo expensive!!  

The car has a poor design for brakes.  The rear calipers need to be lubed every year or they will seize (I have had them replaced about six times!!) and they are undersized.

I have had three alternators, Three sets of struts, two engines, two power sunroof switches, paint is falling off, rust everywhere, sunroof (factory installed) is rotting and leaking - I don't think it was repainted after the roof was cut for the sunroof, three water pumps, two gas tanks, two sets of tie-rod ends, two twilight sentinals, three tape decks, and list goes on, and on .... 

The GM dealerships had VERY poor service, and were very slow in repairing any warranty work.  They made me feel like an inconvenience.  They would not cover the paint flaking off at three years.  They blamed it on stone chips - IN the sunroof?!??

The only good thing about it is that it always starts.  It's very reliable.<br><br>
