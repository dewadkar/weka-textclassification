            Initially, when I first saw the Nissan Sentra I liked the style (of the SE-R) and it's compact size, however, after you drive one for a while, your opinion changes.

The 1993 Nissan Sentra XE is basically an economy car with a decent amount of space and a pretty cheap looking interior.

The exterior is decent enough, with its smooth lines and lack of anything very obtrusive to grab your eye.  It really doesn't say anything, somewhat benign actually.  Without being neither here nor there.  It's rather blah to be honest.  The XE doesn't really come with any exterior amenities like it's SE-R sibling.

The interior is nice enough, bucket seats, cloth interior, everything basically within reach while driving and in something of a logical order.  Very plain and bare bones, no two ways about that.

The performance is horrible!  The power plant for the XE is a 1.6L 4 cylinder putting out roughly 110 hp.  I drove an automatic, there was a huge amount of disparity between me on the gas and the car actually moving.  When going uphill one feels the need to get out and push, perhaps calling Tony Robbins to motivate this little 4 banger is what it needed. 

The body roll wasn't horrible but it was still pretty bad for a car it's size.  It's really odd for a car this size to be rolling all over the place when making a turn, add to that the amount of nose-dive caused by the soft suspension and you've got the makings of a rather motion-sickness filled trip ahead of you.

If you absolutely want a Sentra, look for the SE-R.  With its 140 hp power plant, stiffened suspension, and rear spoiler, it's definitely worth the wait and the look.  If you're not worried about looks/performance as much as just spending a small amount of cash, I suggest you check out the Dodge Neon.
