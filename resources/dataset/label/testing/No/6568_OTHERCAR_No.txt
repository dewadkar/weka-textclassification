                I really like the van but I have had nothing but trouble from day one.  While under warranty,  the mirror fell off, the tape deck ate my tapes, the wipers went on and off by themselves, the speed control would stop working and then start working when you did not want it ( almost had two accidents)
    After the warranty ran out my wallet went empty.  At 39000 miles the evaporator blew, the dealer said the bottom which sits in water rotted out.  New one will probably rot too. The drivers window fell into the door, had to replace lift assembly.   The front brakes went out 42000 miles. At 44k had to replace belt, idle pulley and water pump and had carbon cleaned out of engine.  Tires started to vibrate due to uneven wear so we replaced front tires.
   At 49k replaced gas tank sending unit, had bad smell from AC so the dealer put something to clean.  It helped a little.  I was having a vibration still, dealer said they could not feel it, but it could be cv joints starting to go.
   At 54k car overheated, had to replace fan relay.
   At 60k transmission started leaking and vibration was still bothering me so had left and right axles replaced and front pump seal replaced.  The vibration is better but still there, tires have been balance a dozen times, every time they say that they were out of balance, and now the tire store tells me two of my rims are bent so now I may have to buy new rims which probably still will not fix vibration.
    If anyone else has had a vibration problem and got it fixed please email me thanks
