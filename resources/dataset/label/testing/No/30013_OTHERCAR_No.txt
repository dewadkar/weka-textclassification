            With the price of film so high these days it was inevitable that I would have to go digital if I wanted to continue with my photography. On first look the Kodak DC-280 seemed to be a good choice. Boy was I wrong. It is a good thing that I purchased it at the French Camera Store Target because I returned it 3 days later.

I take a lot of pride in my photography and one of the hardest things to do is remove red-eye when photographing at night. I had already become concerned of the camera and its ability to give me the quality photos I like when I viewed the first shots. When I loaded them into my computer they were of poorer quality than the pictures I get with my Pentax traditional camera and scan into the computer.

This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. At just over $550, the DC-280 is priced considerably lower than the top quality digital cameras. I had no problems hooking the camera up to my serial port and was at least happy with the download speed. One problem that I had was that the battery lasted a very short time. I constantly had to change the battery and that really bothered me. I had to carry extras with me the whole time that I had the camera.

After three days it became apparent that this was just not the camera for me. Although the camera took nice pictures inside the store once I took it outside and used it for a few days I just didn't like the way it performed. If you are looking for a digital camera I would look a little further than the Kodak DC-280.

I don't recommend this one at all!
