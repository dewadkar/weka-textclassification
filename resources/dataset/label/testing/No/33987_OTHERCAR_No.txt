            This camera was on sale when I purchased it about a year ago. I thought I was getting a great deal until I took my first picture.

First off, the camera is easy to use. It also will take a beating (as I have dropped it a few times) and is just the right size to hold. 
If you play with it for a few minutes you understand right off what the two buttons are for on the back (menu button and the "enter" button.) It doesn't have a LCD screen-and i find the viewfinder alittle small.
I didn't particularly like the flash going off every time I took a picture-most of the time I didn't want/need the flash to go off and couldn't find any way to turn it off, so I taped over it. Also it loves to eat batteries! I found that Duracell is the best to use for this camera. It does not come with an adapter.

This camera doesn't have a large amount of memory, you can only take 8 pictures before having to download them on the computer. The program they have is easy to use - but locks up alot and sometimes you have to reboot the computer because it says that it doesn't detect the camera.
The pictures are grainy (especially dark/black objects) and even with a tripod they are still blurry. It doesn't have a zoom, and you have to be at least 3 feet away from the object you are taking a picture of or it is out of focus-if you are any closer than 3 feet the picture is blurry.

Overall, I would recommending passing up this camera if you like pictures that are decent enough to print. Spend alittle more (or if you are lucky, less) money on a better quality camera - especially if you are wanting a camera to take pictures with to sell on Ebay. In that case I recommend buying anything else but this camera! (Sony Mavica's are excellent)
 
If you have children who just want to play with a camera - but you don't want to spend alot of money, this would be a good buy.

I hope this review helped!
