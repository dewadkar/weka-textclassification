             I don't know about where you live but around my home Echo sticker out at about 14,000, That's with automatic and air....Hardly the 9 to 11,000 that I see bantied about..we saw corolla's for about the same money.

The echo is also lacking in lets say comfort..Yes it does have a high hip point ,which makes getting in and out easier,and it does get great mileage, but that's all. the seats in the back don't lay flat when folded down,the seats are cheap vinalish and are NOT comfortable.The exterior design is a little to radical for my tastes.

A 1.5 liter w/vvti powers the echo...which up to 45 powers it fine after that I felt it was lacking. No i don't need to go 80 miles an hour, but if someone on the freeway is going 45 I'd like to feel confident passing them. Hey It is a Toyota and they build fine autos(just like most manufactures today) but its your decision and for $14,000 I feel there are some other automobiles out there that preform nicer and are much more comfortable...In addition we also found that there is very little if any discounting on this vehicle...Good luck<br><br>
