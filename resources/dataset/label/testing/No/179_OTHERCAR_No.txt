            Last year we purchased a brand new 1998 Tracker.  It is a four-door hard shell model with standard transmission.  Ours is champaigne colored, and has cloth seats.  We bought it to replace our Ford Aerostar minivan. While test driving it, we thought that it would be a good city/camping car.  Well, when it came to camping, there's just not enough room, and it is too light a vehicle to pull a 16' bass boat or a 10' pop-up camper.  We took it once with a regular tent, and there just wasn't enough room, for two adults, a ten-year old, and camping gear.  We miss our Aerostar. 
If it hadn't been driven almost 100,000 miles and needed a new air conditioner, we wouldn't have even considered a new car.  It's not a bad vehicle for city use, ie going back and forth to work, and running to the grocery store, but don't try and travel in it.  It gets reasonably good gas mileage - about 17-20 miles to the gallon depending on where I get my gas, and how many stop signs and red lights I have to stop for and how heavy traffic happens to be at any given day.

This is a vehicle for single or newly married couples. When you start having kids, start looking for a minivan!
