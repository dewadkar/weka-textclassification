            My husband and I are in the process of deciding which mini van to purchase.  One way we try out vehicles is to rent them for &quot;road trip&quot; vacations.  That way we get to try them out over a span of several days with only minimal investment.

A few weeks a go we rented a Chevy Astro for a trip from our home in southern Connecticut to my parents home in Southern Virginia, a one way trip of about 950 miles.  

The van had ample storage space for luggage, food cooler and our 80 pound Boxer, but there was no room for our legs in the front seat.  Since my husband has a bad back, I drove about 80% of the time to allow him stretching time.  

Half of the front area for feet is taken up by the front wheel wells.  There was not room for both feet while I was wearing my sneakers.  The passenger seat was no better.

Compared to the Ford Windstar GL my parents had just purchased, the Astro was a disaster.  For comfort, I will never again rent an Astro van, much less actually buy one.<br><br>
