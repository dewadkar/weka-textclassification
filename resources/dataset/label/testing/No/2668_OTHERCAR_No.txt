            <b>Introduction</b>

My most recent rental car experience consisted of four days spent with the base 'S' model of Land Rover's relatively new model, the Freelander. Of course, it's really not a new model at all, since the Freelander has been on sale for years in Europe, prior to Ford's acquisition of the Land Rover brand from BMW. The decision to offer a 2.5 liter V6 in place of the relatively anemic four-cylinder gas and the turbo-diesel engine options available across the pond obviously led Ford's marketing team to the conclusion that the Freelander would now be a viable North American proposition.

And therein lies the root cause of most of this vehicle's many limitations. I'm not a fan of SUVs in general, but the Freelander really seems to be pushing the limits of cynical 'badge engineering'. What is badge engineering? Essentially it refers to one or both of the following: hyping and (over)pricing a relatively down-market vehicle on the basis of the perceived strength of its brand; or repackaging a vehicle so that it can be sold in a more prestigious segment than the original. In the case of the Freelander, marketers are banking on compromises in engineering, quality and so on being overlooked by consumers who more than anything want to say they drive a Land Rover.

There are many other examples of badge engineering, some successful, some not so. BMW's old 'Compact' hatchback used the rear suspension setup of the pre-1992 3-series as a way of selling a BMW to those who couldn't afford a 'real' 318i. Audi sells the A3 in Europe, charging thousands more for what is pretty much a reskinned (and actually heavier and less responsive) VW Golf, leading gullible consumers to believe they are buying an A4 hatch, when in reality the A3 has little in common with the A4. In North America, GM is particularly adept at charging thousands of dollars more for Cadillac or Denali variants of other GM SUVs, which in turn are based on crude pickup truck underpinnings.

The Freelander, more than anything, feels like a below-average competitor in the RAV4 / CR-V space, with the only standout feature being the fact that it is priced approximately $5,000 higher than the Toyota and Honda. Sure, the Toyota and Honda have no V6 option, and I'm sure they aren't nearly as good off road, but as I'll get to later in my review, these really, really aren't reasons to consider the Land Rover.

<b>First impressions</b>

Without Land Rover badging (of which, as another reviewer here has noted, there is a lot), there would be few clues as to the Freelander's origins. Its squat stance and chunky looks combined with the stylish 16" five-spoke alloy wheels, do give an immediate impression of utility and solidity, but on closer inspection countless fussy details disrupt the design. The protruding 'eyeball-like' rear lights, the uneven roofline, the cheap plastic cladding around the wheel arches, even the cheesy font used for the 'Freelander' badge on the tailgate, all contribute to a decidedly 'thrown together' and low rent appearance. Build quality appeared to be below average, with wide panel gaps and, on my rental at least, poorly fitted light clusters fixed with ugly and very visible bolts. What you will also notice through the spokes of those nice wheels are rear drum brakes. Drum brakes on a vehicle starting at over $25,000 and going for well over $30k in HSE specification?

Various exterior option packages are available, three samples of which are listed at the Land Rover website: 'Adventure', 'Edge' and 'San Francisco'. These include different combinations of bull bars, roof racks, foglights and side protection rails, but no pricing is offered at the site, since they are fitted by the dealer after delivery.

Visually, the Freelander really reminds me of a poorly built version of the previous generation Honda CR-V. Not surprising, given that the Rover Group (under whose auspices the Freelander was initially developed) has a long history of sharing models and manufacturing with Honda. I'm not sure if they actually share the same body shell -- it certainly looks as if they do -- but either way, I can't imagine that this is the image many prospective Land Rover buyers are looking for. Further evidence that the Freelander is an old design masquerading as a new model in North America.

<b>Interior and equipment</b>

Get inside the Freelander and things get worse, however. The shiny, hard and brittle-feeling plastics used on the dash and elsewhere were truly shocking on what is supposedly a premium vehicle in its segment. Land Rover has apparently taken lessons from GM in sourcing the nastiest plastic for the Freelander's interior. Push without much force at any of the dash panels, and it will buckle and flex.

The Freelander S's audio system is a generic-looking 80-watt single CD AM/FM unit, equipped with RDS but otherwise no stand-out features. Crank the volume and the six speakers buzz and crackle. Its head unit is finished in a slightly different shade and type of cheap and nasty plastic from the rest of the interior. A 240-watt Harman/Kardon unit with 9 speakers and a subwoofer is standard on the HSE model and a $750 option on the S and SE. If you are at all concerned about sound quality in your vehicle, this upgrade, or an after-market setup, would be essential.

The Freelander's designers apparently scattered the switchgear randomly across the dash. For example, to activate the standard cruise control, it's necessary to push a large button on the edge of the instrument binnacle, to the left of the leather-covered steering wheel, and then use the steering-wheel-mounted controls to set / accelerate / resume. Other buttons, such as those for the rear wiper, are obscured by the steering wheel, and universally they feel cheap and vague in their action.

The back seat, according to the various passengers I carried during my four day rental, is a tight fit for adults of average height, and positively uncomfortable for those over six feet. The front seats are fine, though, firm with good lower back support, and comfortable enough to make the 400 miles I drove in one day relatively painless.

Standard equipment is really quite poor for the price. Power windows, mirrors (not heated) and remote keyless entry are standard, but that, together with the stereo system, is about it. My rental also came with heated front seats (a $300 option). The SE model adds heated leather seats, heated mirrors and 17" wheels, while the HSE includes the H/K sound system, a power moonroof (optional on the SE) and two-tone leather seats. The only transmission available is a five speed automatic with manual shift mode (it's actually BMW's 'steptronic' transmission, dating from the days when BMW owned Land Rover, or at least I assume it is since it is identical in design and operation).

Overall, the Freelander offers equipment levels at or below those of its competitors, in many cases for a higher price. Its one unique feature is the standard 'Hill Descent Control', a technology designed to limit down hill speed during challenging off-road descents. How useful is this feature to the vast majority of buyers who will never take this vehicle off road? Not at all, I'm afraid.

<b>On the road, but not off it...</b>

Where the Freelander is reputed to shine, relative to its compact SUV brethren, is in its performance on and off the road. I have to admit, I was a little underwhelmed.

To begin with, the 174 horsepower / 177 lb/ft 2.5 V6, is simply not enough to make the Freelander feel anything other than somewhat sluggish. Admittedly, its lack of urge does have something to do with the automatic transmission. Slip the shift lever into manual mode, and shift the gears yourself, and it will let you hold on to gears right to the red line, but even this approach hardly produces startling acceleration (0-60 in just over 10 seconds). The shifts themselves are fast and seamless in manual mode, slower in auto 'Sport' mode, while in regular auto mode, the transmission seems to be geared more for fuel economy than performance, meaning that it changes up too quickly and is very reluctant to downshift. I will say that the transmission's manual mode is one of the best I've used, but it would be better if the Freelander were offered with a real manual transmission, at least as an option. I should also mention that the Freelander's steptronic actually felt more responsive than that of a BMW 325i I drove recently, but it could just be that my driving was less aggressive in the Freelander.

I've read in British publications that the best engine available in the Freelander is the torquey (192 lb/ft) TD4 turbo diesel, but it is not offered in the US or Canada. In Britain and elsewhere in Europe, all Freelander models save the V6 are also available with a five speed manual transmission, which would further improve performance.

Perhaps I'm just to much of a car person to tolerate the inherent limitations of SUV handling. I have a problem with accepting a vehicle with handling that will struggle to match a mediocre car, with few benefits other than image and (very rarely used) off-road abilities. Even at fairly low speeds, a sharp corner produces significant body roll in the Freelander, and when I really pushed it, it actually felt a little scary and prone to tipping. However, the steering is nicely communicative and sharp -- quite car-like in fact.

Braking is one of the Freelander's weakest points, or at least my rental had poor brakes. However, given that it had fewer than 5,000 miles on the clock, I doubt that the pads were particularly worn. To begin with, the pedal has a rubbery feel and a lot of dead travel before the brakes engage. Worse still, stopping distances are unsettlingly long, creating a few hairy moments when I had to stop for a just-changed red light. Some of the blame must lie with the rear drum brakes, which I again find to be evidence of unwarranted economizing for the sticker price.

Forward visibility is pretty good, and I will admit that one benefit of SUVs is the high driving position. However, the Freelander can hardly claim this as a unique benefit, and rear visibility is not great -- you'll notice a substantial blind spot when shoulder checking to pass or change lanes. As with the PT Cruiser I drove some time ago, the large side mirrors create a lot of intrusive wind noise at high speeds, and the cabin is wearingly loud at 80 mph or above.

Apparently, the Freelander has great off-road abilities, but I was quite sure that Hertz would not be very pleased if I returned their vehicle with evidence that I?d used it to ford shallow streams or plough through muddy fields. The Hill Descent Control (HDC) is supposed to make practically cliff-like slopes easy to drive down, but as I mentioned earlier, I'm quite sure that this feature will remain a purely theoretical benefit for 99.9 percent of Freelander owners. What will also compromise off-road ability is the lack of a low-range transmission. I was really quite surprised to see this omission in a Land Rover, but then as you've guessed I don't really perceive the Freelander as a real Land Rover.

Overall, there is nothing stand-out about the Land Rover's performance. Sure, the handling is OK, but then I've heard that this is also true of the latest CR-V and RAV 4, both of which come with more standard equipment, cost less and are considerably better built. The HDC comes across as simply a neat feature to give buyers bragging rights, and make them think the green badge on the hood really means something.

<b>Pricing and Value</b>

As you will have guessed by now, I have a serious issue with the price of the Freelander. Once you've added the H/K sound system, or spent money on a third party unit, you?ll be paying over $26k. Step up to the SE version, add the H/K sound, and the price is well over $28k, and for the HSE, the sticker price is almost $32k. A loaded CR-V EX, with AWD and automatic, and features such as a 6-disc in-dash CD, can be had for just under $23k, while a RAV 4 with AWD, leather, automatic and pretty much every option available tops out at around $26k. For less than or the same price as the Freelander in base 'S' trim, you can have more interior room and far better equipment levels, in more modern designs.

OK, each of these vehicles has something of a power deficit (160 hp and 162 lb/ft for the Honda; 148 hp and 142 lb/ft for the Toyota), but acceleration is actually as good or slightly better for either of these vehicles because of lower weight. Plus, they are each available with manual transmissions and interior room is, in the CR-V at least, better than the Freelander as a function of clever cabin design.

Another option in the compact SUV class would be the Jeep Liberty. Even with almost every option checked, including leather, sunroof, upgraded Infinity sound, ABS, heated folding mirrors, full-time 4WD and driver and passenger power seats, the macho top-of-the-line 'Renegade' edition comes to approximately $28.5k. It also comes with a good deal more power (210 horsepower 3.7 liter V6), and in terms of offroad credibility and image it's almost the equal of the Land Rover. Less well equipped versions with 4WD and the V6 can be had for around $23k, before any discounting or rebates.

Perhaps the Freelander is competing in a higher segment of the SUV market? If so, things get worse for it, not better. In terms of domestic competition, the price of a Freelander SE will buy you a Chevrolet Trailblazer 4WD LT, offering 100 extra horsepower, a lot more standard equipment and a much bigger interior. OK, so it's very poorly built, ugly and I'm sure pretty awful to drive, but then the Freelander doesn't do much better, at least with the first two criteria.

Honda's top-of-the-line Pilot EX with leather and DVD system stickers for a fraction over $32k, offering 240 horsepower, a much larger interior and Honda build quality, all in a brand new design. It's a similar story for Toyota's V6 Limited Highlander at just over $31k. Lower spec. versions of these vehicles are available at price points similar to the SE variant of the Freelander. Each of these vehicles has been designed to offer car-like ride and refinement, so I would expect them to be at least the equal of the Freelander on the road, with a host of other benefits.

As far as I'm concerned, the price argument is the final nail in the Freelander's coffin. Buy one and you could have bought a CR-V or RAV 4 for much less and got similar interior room and on-road performance, or you could have spent about the same on a larger, more modern and better equipped SUV from a number of manufacturers.

<b>Conclusions</b>

If you are considering a Freelander, ask yourself this: what does it offer other than the Land Rover brand? From my four days with the vehicle, this question is tough to answer. All I can come up with is reasonable handling for this class of vehicle, a useful manual mode on the automatic transmission, and the Hill Descent Control. If brand and image are very important to you, then you may be able to live with paying more for less, but I would say you can do a lot better elsewhere. Do you really need to go off road? Even here, the Freelander's lack of a low-range transmission means that it won't be up to the most challenging off-road tasks.

Overall, the Freelander comes across as a very cynical marketing exercise, using the image and reputation of the Land Rover brand as a substitute for quality, design and value. Hard to find much in that to recommend...
