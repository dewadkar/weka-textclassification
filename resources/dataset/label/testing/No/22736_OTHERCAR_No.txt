            I purchased this vehicle in 1997 because I needed a reliable car to go to and from work.  I purchased it for $5000 and thought it was a good deal.  
At first, it ran great, it picked up well and seemed to have no problems.  

The problems started small and got considerably worse.  The first time I drove my boyfriend around the block in it, the passenger window would not go down.  It seemed to work intermittently.  As my shift at work changed from 10AM to 7PM to 8AM to 5PM, I noticed a VERY big problem.  The car would over heat just sitting in traffic.  I did not have an unusually long commute, but more than ten minutes of traffic, and the car would over heat causing me to pull over.  I then noticed, to my amazement, that the car leaked all over the place and when I checked the radiator that it was nearly bone dry!  I had been told the heater core needed to be replaced which was done.  No more leaks but it still overheats.
This was the most major problem, but there were other minor electrical problems.  Sometimes the car had trouble starting due to a bad connection at the battery.  Light bulbs would work intermittently.  I cannot tell you how many times I was pulled over because the license tag light was not working at the time the officer saw me (at least three times and received tickets for other things).  The passenger window got worse and now does not go up all the way nor down all the way.  At times the driver's side window does not work.  The automatic seat sometimes cannot be adjusted.

I now only drive it when I can be sure that there will be no traffic (I cannot have a 9 to 5 job)because it still overheats.  And it has overheated so quickly and so bad that vapors (steam?) has come through the defrost vents inside the car.  I feel very unsafe driving the car as I cannot be sure when the thing will break down.

I have spoken with some other Pontiac Grand Am drivers.  One who owned an older model (not sure what year) claimed that there were electrical problems with her car (like the window problem) and one who purchased a new Grand Am (1998 I think) that broke down on the highway within months of the purchase.

I will never buy a Pontiac Grand Am ever again and I hope to get rid of the one I have as soon as possible.<br><br>
