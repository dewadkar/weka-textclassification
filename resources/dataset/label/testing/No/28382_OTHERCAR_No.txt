            I have driven this 91 Prelude SI ALB for some time now, and although I personally don't own it, I believe I qualify to be a well informed reviewer.
My dad bought it quite a few years back, when he needed a reliable transportation, that would be easy to park and would give the driver some joy while behind the wheel. Well, I must tell you this car handles very well in corners, there is relatively small understeer, but hey! it's front wheel drive car so you just have to live with that. 
It has adequate power as long as you drive downhill or on level road. I only weigh 180 pounds, but find myself looking for 4th gear while trying to get over the relatively small hills. This car has 2.0 liter 135 hp engine that only cranks out 115 lb/ft of torque, so that explains it. I must admit though that the car is quick off the line. 
The reliability of this car has been OK except for ALB. ALB stands for Anti Lock Brakes and has all kinds of flaws; I have already replaced 3 front brake calipers because of constant brake sticking.
Interior materials deserve my appreciation; high-grade plastics and quality fabric is worthy anybody's attention. Not so with space; my 5'11" body barely fits in the car with my seat pushed all the way back, at the same time there is only enough room for a infant car seat on the back seat. One more detail about the interior is lack of emergency tool for the sunroof. Nobody is protected from a situation where you are stuck under the rain with your roof unable to close because the motor blew. I personally own Saab and VW both with sunroofs and both with emergency tools for closing the sunroof in situation like that.
Apparently the people that are high on this car are the people that belong to some kind of midget club or die-hard Honda fans, otherwise I can't find any reasons to spend that kind of money on the car that leaves you bruised and banged up because of lack of space and deliver only so-so performance.
My reccomedation would be to take your money, and spend it on the car that you will enjoy driving and that will still be reliable for you in the long run, and that will have some torque to pull more than one person at a time. Get a Golf GTI or Sentra SE-R etc.
