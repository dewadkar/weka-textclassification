            My first Chrysler.  Even after the days when Chrysler made people cringe.  That was back in the 70s when my father owned one.  Remember when Chrysler took a large loan from the US Treasury (?) and then made a big stink when they paid it back early?  Ah, maybe you're too young.  I remember it.  

So, Chrysler cars are looking pretty good.  Nice styling, better commercials.  Well, I bought into it.  I bought my Jeep in December 1996.  A 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.  Not 7000 miles into owning my first SUV, it needed a brake job.  Resurfaced rotors, new pads.  Had the Fuel sending unit recall done.  Mind you, I had no problem before the recall.  You don't remember what the recall was about?  The fuel gauge could read &quot;Full&quot; when in fact, you were on &quot;Empty.&quot;  I took the Jeep in, and no sooner than I left the dealership, did my fuel gauge reading go immediately to &quot;Empty!&quot;  Thanks Chrysler.  Now I DO have the problem.  Four tries and counting, it still doesn't operate correctly.  I had to give up.  The dealer stated they would continue to try and fix it.  Only I couldn't take every Monday off from work and they never have a loaner vehicle.

What now.  Another recall.  Airbag module.  Seems that my airbag could all of a sudden deploy.  Yep.  That;s right.  Just waiting there for the light.  Boom.  Bring it in again!

I could bore you with all the details, but here are the facts.  My Jeep has 40,000 miles on it.  I've had it back to the dealer 18 times.  Yes, 18!  You figure it out.  That's every 2300 miles?  Never again.  No more Chryslers for me.  My 1991 Nissan Maxima has 126,000 miles.  Guess how many time it's been in for service other than tune ups, oil changes, belts, hoses (regular maintenance)?   Never.  I repeat, never.  If I were to keep my Jeep that long, at the rate I was going, I would have been to the dealer over 57 times.
