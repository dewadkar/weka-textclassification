            Let me start this Epinions by stating that the Mitsubishi Mirage I own is not exactly the car I dreamed of purchasing.  I am the former owner of a Nissan Altima that I absolutely adored (see my review for more info).  At a little over 100,000 miles my transmission blew and I decided to get a new car as opposed to fixing it.  That was mistake number one.

So I go to the dealer and tell them my dilemma.  I work for a company that requires a lot of driving and I am not in a position where I have time to shop around.  I need a new car ASAP.  The dealer takes all my information and tells me they can put me in to this 1997 Mitsubishi Mirage.  They bring the car around for me to view.  It looks cute, but how does it ride.  I take the car out for a short test drive and it seems to have a smooth enough ride.  Ok, I'll take it.  So I drive off the lot an hour later in my 1997 Mistubishi Mirage.

I soon realized that the test drive I took was WAY too short.  I come to my first set of railroad tracks and as I go over them, I get the sensation of being in a rickety old pick-up truck.  I think to myself "well those were railroad tracks so I should expect a slightly bumpy feeling".  Then I come to the next minor bump in the road and reality hits me.  This car is NOT made for bumpy travel.  When I am riding on a smoothly paved road I have no complaints but when it comes to bumpy spots, this car does not do well.  

When it comes to the space factor, the Mirage again fails, unless your are a dwarf.  The inside of the car is so tight that even a person of average height like myself is left with little leg room.  When you have a boyfriend who is 6ft 5in tall, there is a major discomfort factor.  The back seat gives only a few inches of leg room and the front seat gives minimal leg room as well.  This is not a vehicle one can take on long road trips if they seek a comfortable, relaxing ride.

The one major positive to the Mirage is the gas mileage.  I get roughly about 340 miles to a tank.  This is a blessing for me as I put an average of 600 miles a week on my car.  I can fill up for about $13.

If I had to rate my satisfaction level with this car on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the best I would probably give it a 6.  I am better off then some people I suppose who have no vehicle so I try to be thankful but on the other side of the coin, I will definitely be more selective when it comes time to purchase a new car.
