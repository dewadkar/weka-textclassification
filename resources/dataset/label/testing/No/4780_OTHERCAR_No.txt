            We bought a 1995 Plymouth Grand Voyager used with 38,000 miles on it.  I wanted a vehicle with lots of room.  I liked the security feature of the doors locking automatically when you got up to around 20mph or so.  My son loved the storage compartment and two cup holders in the back.  You could comfortably fit eight adults with the second and third bench seats. It ran great until about 70,000 miles and then we started noticing that when we accelerated over 40mph the entire van would shake horribly.  Not long afterwards, came the plate sized puddles of transmission fluid on the driveway.  About the time the transmission fluid started leaking, we noticed that if you accelerated to 55mph quickly, such as in a passing lane, the engine would make a clunking sound and the speedometer would drop to zero.  I traded it in at a loss (as we still owed on the loan but just wanted out of the problems) for a 2000 GMC Jimmy.  I love my Jimmy and will never consider another Chrysler product.<br><br>
