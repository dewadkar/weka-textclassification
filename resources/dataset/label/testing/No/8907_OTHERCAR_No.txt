            I've been using this Camera for about a year now. When I bought it I paid �100 for it but that was in a sale, its usual price was �200 so I picked up a bargain. And it has been a bargain.

The 2100Z takes reasonably good quality pictures at around 2 Mega pixels. The images appear quite sharpe with good colour definition. Which is good enough for general purpose snap shots.

Don't expect to be able to create huge enlargements with this Camera. I can usually edit a photo by cropping it to half its size & then doubling the size. Thats about the best it can manage.

The Camera itself is quite bulky & I think it looks ugly. Not the usual stylish thing you would expect from a Digital Camera made by Epson. Another fault of the Camera is the LCD screen which is not very bright. This means you can't see the screen on a bright day & if you turn the screen on an angle it disappears from view.

Its possible to Pan & Zoom images on the LCD screen after taking the shot. I'm not sure why you would need this but its there. In low lighting conditions you can see the images on screen quite clearly. This is a bonus really & good for showing your subject.

The Camera takes Compact Flash Memory cards which are quite cheap these days. I've recently bought a 128MB Memory card this can take well over 200 pictures & only cost �20. This is also extremely easy to transfer data from, just get yourself a Multi-card reader & pop the Memory card in this. Doing this saves your Camera batteries.

Speaking of batteries the 2100Z gets through batteries at an alarming rate so get some rechargeble batteries, you will need four of them ( AA sized ).

The Camera comes equipped with a 2 X optical lens & 2.5 X digital. This means its possible to zoom in by 5 times if you need it. This could be better. Ifound there were times when I needed to get closer but you get what you pay for.

There is one really bad aspect of this Camera. Shutter Lag. It takes about half a second from pressing the button for the shutter to operate. This is way to long for anything moving. I tried several times to capture my Granddaughter in motion. This was a waste of time.

Altogether the Epson 2100Z is a good Camera for what you pay. I would recommend it to anyone looking to start out in Digital Photography. But definately not for the advanced user.
