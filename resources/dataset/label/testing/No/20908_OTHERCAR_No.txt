            I love retro, I am a huge fan of old style vehichles, but this pathetic attempt to merge a hot rod and a minivan makes me ill to my stomach. I test drove a PT-Cruiser just for the fun of it (it is way out of my price range) and I found many major flaws. 
     My first complaint is the look. I think this car has got to be as ugly as they come, I test drove this vehichle because everyone was raving about it and I figured there had to be some justification because the tacky chrome and hot rod styling pasted onto an entirely too large frame for such styling could not possibly be it. I will admit to the vehichle being a bit areodynamic but I still say that I would prefer to drive an 86' Chevy Celebrity with 200,000 miles and rust that passed for a paint job simply because the celebrity would look ten times as stylish and would handle better to boot.
     Handling is my next complaint. The last time I drove a tub like that it was a VW minibus, and even the minibus had some sort of turning capability. You had better pray other drivers are blinded by the sheer hideousness of your cruiser because other wise there is no way you are going to survive a 4 lane highway turn on. Especialy if you have to brake quickly
     The brakes were perhaps the worst feature in an already abysmal automobile, they were not ABS, nor were they very good standard brakes. I could stop ten times as fast in my old Dodge Lancer, which hadn't had it's brake pads changed for at least 2 years before I bought the car and the main claim to glory that car had for me was the fact that the back seat folded down to become part of the trunk. Great for a place to relax and get comfy with a date if you catch my meaning but other than that the car was pretty useless, however that was due to it's age and not it's incompetence of design, which seems to be the cruisers case. not to mention, despite it's age the Lancer at least had some acceleration.
      The PT-Cruiser's gas pedal is an amusing thing. You push it expecting to go forward with at least a reasonable attainment of speed. Alas, such is not the case, while slow and steady may have won the race, in this case I think fast and consistent will rule the day, especialy at those wonderful highway exits. This car's engine is a vastly overtaxed peice of engineering, decidedly inadequate for the monumental task it has been given of hauling around the carcass of chrome that passes for a car body. The engine alone is an indication that you should not buy the vehichle, especialy for the price.
      Why must a vastly overrated vehichle such as this cost as much as it does? Why must this perversion of Research and Development rack up a price tag of sixteen thousand some dollars? And why must foolish yuppies snap these attempts at retro up as fast as the factories can churn them out? The answer is very simple, hype. This is an automobile that has overhyped itself into superstardom and I for one am sickened by the twisting of a great american industry into making something as sad as a PT-cruiser
