            Last Christmas I got my father-in-law a Sony CD350 digital camera.  We have continuously been amazed at the quality of pictures that the camera has produced.  (Either that, or my father-in-law should have been a professional photographer!)

I decided to get one for myself this year, and turns out the CD350 is on the way out.  You can't find them in any of the local Best Buy/Circuit City stores.  They are - as of this writing - still online.  But that got me to thinking, "why not step it up a little and get a 5Mp camera?"

So I got the DSC-P10 and a 256Mb MediaStick Pro and a spare battery.  Total cost, a little over $500.

The long and short of it is that the camera takes decent pictures.  However, they are hit and miss and in my opinion, more miss than hit.  Lots of out of focus shots.  Even more poorly illuminated shots.  These have all been with the camera in full auto mode.

When it takes a good picture, it is pretty good!  But the aforementioned CD350 took more pictures, better.

Here's my GUESS.  It's the lens.  The CD350 has a better lens IMHO and I think that is the fatal flaw.  If I had it to do over, I'd have stepped up to the next Sony that has the Carl Ziess (?) lens (much bigger) and it probably would have been a better use of my money.  

Other notes:  One of the deciding factors for me with this camera was size.  Vs the CD-350 it is light-years smaller and fits comfortably in your pocket.  Frankly, it is almost too small. You find yourself wanting to wrap your hand around it and I have to be careful not to accidentally touch the lens.

Battery life seems pretty good to me, but I have little to compare it to.  I bought a spare so I should be ok in extended situations.  The battery is tiny so it carries well in the $6 leather bag we bought at Wal-Mart (or Target, I forget.)  They are proprietary and expensive though.

One thought, for accessories to this camera, check EBay.  I could have saved another $30 or so if I had gotten my memory stick and battery on EBay.

Overall, pretty good product, but expensive and I expected more.  Only 3 stars for this one.
