            It's a great, inexpensive 4 wheel drive vehicle. I've had mine for 2 1/2 years and it runs right through the snow even in our steep driveway.  It rides like a care and handles well.  It is reasonably priced; not any more than a mid-size car.  

This sounds trivial, but I hate the interior.  It should come in tans and other solid colors.  The only other complaint I have are some minor problems I've had with it.  The gas sensors went out within 1 year and the cruise went out within 2 years.  Recently I had the 2 bushings holding the sway bar in the front replaced because they wore out.  

Mechanically (engine wise) this is a great SUV that you can count on to run great and quietly; along with great gas mileage.  It gets 23 on short trips and 28 on the highway.  

You can fit a lot of everything in this car.  I have two car seats in the back and there's still room for a diaper bag and toys in the back seat.  Then there's the cargo area.  It's huge.  I can really haul some stuff back there.  The rear seats fold snug against the front seats for extra storage room as well.
