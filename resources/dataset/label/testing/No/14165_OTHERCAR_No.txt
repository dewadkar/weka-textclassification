            Let me set something straight to begin with:

I did not test-drive this with intent to own. Sorry, but 90k is a bit too rich for my blood.  If that biases any of my opinions, well, you be the judge. :) 


     In colorado we have a very large uber-dealership, called Medved. they sell everything from Geo's to Hummer's to streach limo's to heavy duty work trucks. I asked them to test drive one of the new Hummers, and they said
     &quot;No.&quot;

     No big shocker there.

Fortunitly I had an opportunity to drive a 1998 model that a friend owned. (and we still grill him about it every time we see him. what are good friends for?)

     Now the only difference between the 98 and the 00 model, is the interior. The interior on the 2000 model is noticably quieter, and rather, well, &quot;nicer&quot; would be the word I use. more cupholders. :) 

    Lets get down to business.

     The Hummer is a civilian model of the HMMWV (High Mobility Multi Wheeled Vehicle), AKA the &quot;HumVee&quot;, aka the M-998. 
     It was designed to replace the venerable willys-overland &quot;Jeep&quot; that had been in service in one form or another for the last 50 years. The problem with the Jeeps, was that they were too light for the increasing weight that needs to be carried by a modern fighting force, and they had a tendancy to flip in untrained hands. They were also Not-armored (open or fabric tops), which was a real down-side on the battlefield.

     The Humvee was built to be extraordinarily wide, with a very low profile, and extremely high ground clearence, and could be had in several varients and options, including the famous Kevlar armored version, that will stop anything short of a .50 caliber round. It was given independant suspension all the way around for increased mobility in the open fields, and an insanely high 16 inches of ground clearence, also for increased mobility in open fields. Due to the fact that it was so wide with such a low profile, it had no trouble staying upright in even the most ludicrous of angles. It was fitted with a turbo diesel engine, and has a tow rate that can rivel a mack truck, while ferrying anywhere from 2 to 12 foot soldiers around, depending on it's configuration, (2 door flatbed, 4 door, 4 door wagon, 2 door flatbed with bench seat rear, ambulance varient, radio-van varient, SAM varient, yada yada yada...)

Good for the military.

Unfortunitly, You don't get the same options listing.

The Civilian varient of the Humvee, the Hummer, can be ordered in several different configurations, unfortunitly neither the SAM launch vehicle, nor the Anti-tank TOW equipped varients are offered. The most popular civilian version is the 4 door Wagon, which is your typical SUV configuration (2 doors front, 2 doors middle, and then a hatch/doors in the very back, cabin entirely enclosed in metal, with no outside cargo space.) This is also the most expensive version. 

The least expensive is the 2 door hummer, which is typically purchased by construction firms, or people who need a serious work truck. You can put practically anything on the rear, as it is essentially a rather Brutish pickup truck at that point. 

The middle range options are the 4 door soft-top version, and the 4 door hard-top version, both of which leave the very rear of the vehicle exposed to the elements, somewhat like the Explorer Sport Trac. 

The Engines offered are a 6.5 liter TurboDiesel engine, and a gasoline powered V8. 

I'll let you in on a little secret. the Diesel option is not the same one the military uses, since it doesn't meet with EPA requirements. 
The diesel engine you get is the Detroit Diesel 6.5 liter model found in older GMC trucks. Probobly the worst diesel engine in the american marketplace today, as GMC has apparently dropped it as an option alltogether, untill it and it's new partner Isuzu can build one more on par with the Cummins turbodiesel (dodge) and Navistar Powerstroke (Ford) diesel engines.  It's really quite underpowered and somewhat unreliable in comparison, but that's just my opinion. :) 

    The gasoline engine is completely undeniably underpowered. I beleive it to be a 350ci purchased from GM. they should have gone with a 454ci V8 or a V-10 if they can shoe-horn it in there....

    Which brings up another problem: Interior Room. Or rather, lack thereof.  See, one of the key features of the Hummer is it's great ground clearence, and it's ability to survive land mines, both acheived by pushing the engine and transmission upwards. Unfortunitly, to do that, they pushed it right into the passanger compartment. There's an enourmous bulge in the center of the vehicle, which takes up a LOT of space. On the military versions, a footsoldier usually stands on said bulge to poke his/her head up out of the Machine gun turret. You have no turret. it's just kinda a waste of space. I've seen people flatten it out a little bit to make it into a table for the kids in back to eat on, but. The thing is sorely lacking for room, at least that's my impression. 

     As stated earlier, it's inadiquately powered compared to other SUV's in it's class (Size-wise only, as there really *ISNT* anything in it's class...). 
    Acceleration is measured on a calander. Braking is surprisingly good though. 

     Now. The independant suspension I was talking about earlier, was designed for cross country travel, and hauling around alot of weight. This means, it's not the same double-wishbone you have in the caddilac. The suspension is tuned for eating a rock going about 45 mph while towing a field artillary peice. When this is translated to city driving, You're gonna feel every pothole, every bump, every expansion joint on the bridges. Of course, you're in a hummer, so you don't care, just so long as you look good.

     Off-Roading:
     Surprisingly, it doesn't fare as well as you'd expect. 

It was designed for off-roading through open fields and mud, where you'd expect to have a battlefield. It does not bode well on narrow, rocky, flex-is-a-must Jeep trails scattered throughout the rocky mountains. Apparently, AMG was going to follow jeep's example and drive the first civilian hummer over the Rubicon trail. unfortunitly, doe to the lack of suspension flex, the thing bounced all over the place, and wound up breaking the half-shafts (thats what the hummer uses instead of axles), and wound up needing a helicopter to get free. Fortunitly, even the civilian hummer is equipped with hard-points for helicopter insertion. :)

This isn't to say it's a lame-duck, far from it, but If it were up against a Land-Rover or Jeep in the rocks, I'd put the money against the Hummer.  Put it in an open field, and it'll shine. 

Reliability is also an issue, it requires alot of maintainence. ALOT of maintainence. it wasn't designed for going extreme-distances without replacement parts, (the army has a motorpool, it's best to design something that can be easily fixed, rather than design something that's hard to break), but this translates to $$$$ for the owner. 

of course, if you have 90,000 bucks to blow on a 4x4 that rides like a willys jeep and has about the same elbow room, you can afford a few stops in the shop a year. 

The Hummer is a great vehicle, there's no doubt about that. But placing it in the city, is just taking it out of it's environment. It wants to be a green, mean, fighting machine.
