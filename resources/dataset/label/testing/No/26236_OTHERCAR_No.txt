MrClean's Suggestion and Conclusion:

BMW is reknown for it's cars and the way it builds them, but this is one of the first SUV's and they will learn from this somewhat bad experience, give BMW a few more years and they will build a perfect BMW SUV that is just like their other prized cars, works of art.<br><br>
