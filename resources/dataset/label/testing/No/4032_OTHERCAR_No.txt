            Chevrolet recently changed the body styles on their silverado and c/k trucks, tahoes, and suburbans. I own a '99 tahoe LT with everything. 

     The problems started when I noticed vibration at speeds over 100 km/h in the steering column and squeeking here and there. It took my local chev dealer 6 months to figure out that the BF Goodrich tires that came from the factory on this very high end, high price vehicle were so bad, they refused to balance 3 of the 4 tires. I solved the problem by dishing out about $700.00 for a set of premium Michelin LTX/MS tires, and so far they've been excellent, I recommend them to anyone with a truck or an suv.
     
     The next thing my radio went. I have a cd/cassette/am/fm 8 speaker stereo, and the am crackles all the time. My dealer checked the grounds, replaced the deck and the antenna, and a few cables in there somewhere and it didn't do a thing. The fit on the inside of this vehicle is disgusting. On one side the dash meets the door frame at 1/4 inch, on the other side it's 1/16th of an inch. This vehicle is a piece of garbage, and I wish I'd never bought it. 

     This experience has soured me on american vehicles for life, and I'll never buy one again. I have to take this Tahoe in to the garage almost every 4 months for a broken something for this or that. If you DO get one, buy the extended warranty. I bought 3 years of bumper to bumper, and my dealer now pays for the repairs on this piece of garbage, and they hate me for it. 

     I recently test drove a 2001 Nissan Pathfinder, a 2001 Infiniti QX4, a Toyota 4Runner, and a Toyota Tundra. The Nissan and the Infiniti are basically the same thing, with better looks in the QX4. I'd buy one, but with the price of gas right now, I simply can't afford to be driving a vehicle that only runs on premium gasoline. Other than that, the QX4/Pathfinder is an incredible vehicle. 

    The 4Runner has a horrible stereo, it's a good vehicle as well, but for $3,000 dollars more than the pathfinder le, less options and far less power should result in a better vehicle. My next vehicle? 2001 Toyota Tundra, it has a gutsy V8, smart looks, best power and towing capacity in it's class, and it's the best quality full size pickup on the market. If you're going american on pickups, stay away from ford. Dodge and Chevy/GMC are good for american trucks, but they're both garbage stacked-up to the Tundra.<br><br>
