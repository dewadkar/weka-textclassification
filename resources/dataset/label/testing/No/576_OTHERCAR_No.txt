     I have worked for Hyundai two years. Now it is time to say what I have learned. The Warranty From Hyundai is really great, But there is a catch to this warranty. 
     
     The ten years 100,000 mile is good if you like to spend a lot of time at the dealership. The Accent has a smart Transmission that thinks when the driver is driving. It will give you power when you really need.
     
     Just like the 1999 Sonata. This is the first year that Hyundai has used this transmission for the Accent. So it is hard to say how many they will install before they work out all the bugs. 
    
     But if its like the first model of Accents they will have a lot to change. When I was working at Hyundai I know we have replaced five since the 2000 model year has started. The Seatbelts are hooked up with the airbags. 
     
     If the passenger front seatbelt is not hooked in the airbag will not go off. It is a nice to have if you get into a wreak. Hopefully that will happen. But it does happen. I hope this helps you out before buying the Hyundai Accent. I hope you see why before you buy.<br><br>
