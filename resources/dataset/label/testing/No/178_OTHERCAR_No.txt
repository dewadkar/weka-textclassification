            I fell in love with the 1998 Chevy Tracker convertible I bought. I had several people I know recommend the Tracker to me, so I felt is was a good bet over the Jeep Wrangler I was also looking at. Dumb move, very dumb move. Within 300 miles I was broke down with transmission trouble. I wasn't worried that is what warrantees are for. The problem was diagnosed as an engine failure. It broke down again at over 600 miles, and again at around 900. Same problem all within a month. I had the car about a week in the first month. It broke down again at 1200 miles but the problem went away on it's own the next day when I was taking it back to the dealer. The problem came back at roughly 1500 miles. The next time it went out around 3000 miles. On the 4th breakdown I contacted the Ohio State Attorney Generals office and filed a complaint. I also turned Chevy into the BBB because they did absolutely nothing for me. The dealer said it was GMs fault. Finally some VP got me on the phone, said give us one more chance and we will pay for your extended warranty. So I let them look at it for the 7th time. This time the dealer replaced the tranny and the problem went away. GM never lived up to the promise to pay for the extended warrantee. Other problems: spins out easy ( almost put me in a lake and the Lake Milton police can testify to that) Back door window brace is plastic and broke easily. 4 wheel drive doesn't work as expected.
small 10 gallon gas tank and 20 miles to the gallon has me at the gas station often. Heats nice for a rag top and the stereo is great. I now hear a strange bang when I turn. I have driven this vehicle for a year now, and it isn't any better than the first time. Who should buy this?... NOBODY! I wouldn't even give it one star.<br><br>
