            I brought this car a few years ago cause i needed a hooptie. Thats a car that gets you from Point A to point B and nothing more.  It did meet that requirement for about a year but then it started to bug me. Once I hit a pothole and I got $2000 in Damage. Thats NOT supposed to happen with ANY car. But the Geo is an Exception. Its not Comfortable at all and the seats feel like they are made of cardboard. The Engine was rated at a weak 90 horsepower so it was very hard to keep up with Traffic on the freeways. The suspension is almost non exsistant and you can feel every bump on the road. Worst of all when you approach 70 Miles Per Hour, the Car starts to Rattle. At times driving upstate i felt the Car would explode if I went over 80. The Engine gets loud and strained at that speed. But the Miles Per Gallon are very good, 35 last time I checked, would be even better if it had a good tuneup.
