            We bought our 1996 Plymouth Neon in August of 1996.  We do still currently have the car, but only because we can't afford to buy another one.

This car has been nothing but trouble for us from the very beginning.  In the 4 years that we've owned this car, I've replaced the brakes twice and now have been told that I need new breaks again!  Plus the darn breaks squeal like crazy every time I come to a stop!  

I've also had a head gasket leak three different times.  I've had a cracked radiator which cost me an arm and a leg just 2 months ago.  Then a piece I had never heard of got me stranded in the middle of the night 20 miles from home, the neutral safety switch.  Apparently, this little &quot;switch&quot; can pop out of it's slot when you hit a bump and the next time you try to start your car, it's no go!

Now, I don't know much about cars but three leaking head gaskets in 4 years sounds like an awful lot to me, so do all the rest of the problems.  

I've also been told by a mechanic friend of mine that he sees a lot of these cars because of their air conditioning failing.  Now, I have never had this problem personally but with all the problems I have had, it wouldn't surprise me.

As far as space and comfort, I have no real complaints about it.  The trunk is adequate and the back seats all three of my children, including two car seats.  

I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone due to the problems I have had in the engine and I will NOT be buying another Chrysler/Plymouth ever again.  <br><br>
