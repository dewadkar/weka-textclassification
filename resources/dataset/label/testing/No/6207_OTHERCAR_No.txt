            My Camry experience was short-lived (4 days courtesy of Mr Hertz), but my first and lasting opinion was that this has to be one of the most bland conveyances imaginable.  Sure, the engine's very quiet and the ride's superb.  However, as a 2.4L automatic, I found the acceleration disgustingly slow.  The engine revved smoothly up to within 1000rpm of the redline after which it started to get a little asthmatic, but never really flexed its biceps at any point. You really need to feed it a fair bit of juice just to maintain a constant speed up a moderate incline at 100kph (~62mph). Body roll was there for the taking; as soon as you try and push it hard into a corner, handling disintegrates into a sodden pile of understeer.  Even the brakes, whilst capable, seem over-servoed.  The steering was surprisingly well weighted, though pretty dead near the middle.

However, the air-conditioning was magnificently cold, and the stereo puts many other cars' to shame.  This really is a car built just for passengers.  At no point in time did this car encourage the driver to press on and enjoy themselves in the least little bit.

All you need to do is order one in stark white and cover it in Whirlpool or Kelvinator badges.  It truly is a boring commuting appliance.
