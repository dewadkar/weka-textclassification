            I've had this camera for about 8 months and have taken some excellent pictures with it. Unfortunately, I missed a lot of great shots because the camera wasn't always ready when I was. As in-- click for a picture and then 1-2 seconds later it finally gets around to taking it (yes, I tried manual focus as well). Try gettings kids to stay still for more than a second! 

In my mind, one of the most important features of a "novice" camera is responsiveness. More important than megapixels, more important than battery life, etc... take the picture when I press the button!

It also does not perform well in low light situations, worse than some other digital cameras I've seen. Perhaps with a tripod, but that defeats the whole purpose of a small point & shoot camera. I've also found that sometimes I need to manually adjust the white balance setting to avoid having dimly lit pictures appear red. Blah.

And there's a "scenery dial" on the top, which at first sounded like a good idea-- the dial pre-sets the camera to perform better in those situations. Unfortunately, for me, it never quite worked right. And forget trying to explain them to people. Just keep it on AUTO.

Don't get me wrong... the Nikkon 775 does have some selling points. It's small and lightweight, and has the potential to take excellent pictures (especially of scenery). But I just don't think it's a good fit for a family or a novice point & shoot photographer.

I'm disappointed enough with this camera that I'm thinking about selling it. It's not horrible, but I think there's much better cameras for me on the market.
