            I recently purchased a D-Link DSC-350 off of Ubid for $73 dollars.  When I found it on Ubid, I was happy to see a digital camera that doubled as a webcam.  I placed my bids, won the auction, and awaited its arrival.  Now that I have found Epinions.com, I wish I would have checked it out on here before bidding.

The D-Link arrived to me in about a week.  I opened the box and found a small camera.  Like another Epinioner said, "About as big as a Marlboro box and as light."  I wasn't impressed, but I thought I'd give it a chance.

I put the batteries in and fired it up.  I decided to take a few pictures of my living room just to try it out.  I lined up the shot, pressed the button, and it screamed at me with a series of beeps.  Later I found out that the built in light meter has to have a certain amount of light to take a picture.  What a drag...and no flash, to boot!

So I took it outside and tested it out.  It finally took some pictures, but when I uploaded them onto the computer they were not the greatest.  I have to blame this on the D-Link's <i>interpolated</i> 1024 x 768 picture quality.  INTERPOLATED!  I was kind of mad.

So I thought I'd try it as a webcam and this is where it became decent, in my mind.

I still use the D-Link occasionally for <i>outdoor use only.</i>  but do not highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to buy a camera.  If like the dual-mode capability then this is an inexpensive way to go, but don't think you're going to take the best photos.
