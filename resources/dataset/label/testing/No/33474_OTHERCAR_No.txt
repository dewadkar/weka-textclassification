            The 1991 Chevrolet Cavalier was purchased for me as my fist new car.  What a mistake that was.  

From the moment I drove my beautiful, shiny new car it home it was nothing but trouble.  It started with the first day the whole electrical system blew (of course on a Friday, so nothing could be done until Monday).  Then it just went on from there, it would stall all of the time (even though it was an automatic and it was the summer), the a/c wouldn't work, etc.  I had the car for one year and it was in the shop 42 times in that year.  That is not even counting the multiple days and weeks that it was there.  They replaced the entire electrical system, solenoids, just about everything.  Finally I was filling out the paperwork to submit through the lemon law in CT when GM wanted to settle out of court and gave me the purchase amount towards another GM car.

The car itself was very comfortable, stylish, had a decent factory stereo, and the engine was pretty peppy (at least for a first car for a 17 year old), it was just all of the problems that became too much to handle.

I purchased a Pontiac Grand AM afterwards that I liked a lot more, but the GM cars just aren't made as well as the Honda's, Nissan's, or Toyota's.  I want to have pride in the USA's workmanship, but with my experience it is hard.<br><br>
