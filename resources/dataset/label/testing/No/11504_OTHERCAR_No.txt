            Our family originally bought a Chevrolet 3500 Series pickup truck with an extended cab, and the largest engine available for pulling horse trailers.  We were really impressed with the truck for over a year, and that was when the problems started.  Now granted pulling horse trailers constantly on long trips is not the easiest work for the truck, but considering the amount of money put in to the vehicle, we had expected all these problems to come later.  There were many little problems that seemed to repeatedly occur right after we would get one fixed.  A fan belt would break, or we would overheat in not too extremely hot weather, etc.  We may give some credit to the major parts of the truck which we did not have to repair, such as the engine, transmission, etc.  But for the most part I was thoroughly unsatisfied with the Chevy 3500 overall<br><br>
