            O.k. When i bought this car i didnt know what i was in for. It looked nice drove fairly nice and at the price tag (used $11,500 with 45,00 miles) I couldn't find anything wrong with it. Well, about 5 months later, when I started the car up in the morning the engine would run very erratically. It idled very strange for about a minute and then stalled out.The Transmission was making funny sounds and then stopped.I took the car to the factory and they couldn't find anything wrong with it. After about a month later of the same business when i started the car up I did come research and found out it could be this part that might have gone bad. I can't remember what the name is off the top of my head but i know it had some thing to do with controlling the emissions. I tried to do this my self and barely succeeded being that the 3.4 liter engine is shoehorned into the engine bay. I had to get my 8 year old son to connect the wires together. After all this frustration of putting this part in, it didn't solve the problem. So i took it to the factory. The factory said that some computer that controlled the emissions had to be reset. I had them work on it and it finnaly idled right again. Two months later the passenger side rear door couldnt be opened from the outside. Something broke with the locking mechanism in the door. Then a few months later, I must have hit the gas too hard and the car stalled out. 
I cant explain how it happened any other way. After i got it started again the light that says &quot;service engine soon&quot; came on. I bet it needed the computer reset again or something else. I said &quot; forget it, I better get rid of this car before someting else breaks&quot;. So I bought a new Toyota Camry and i love it. Alot better designed and engineered. handles alot better too, i would have to fight the Lumina going through turns. The brakes on the Lumina were pretty scary too, sometimes i thought the car wouldn't stop. But I took good care of the brakes, i guess it was just the design.    <br><br>
