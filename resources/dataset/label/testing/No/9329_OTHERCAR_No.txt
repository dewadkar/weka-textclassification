            I bought a 1991 Plymouth Laser RS used from a dealer.  It looked great!  I even had a warranty with it....THANK GOD!!! The first thing was the oxygen sensor..$150.  Then the rack and pinion ( not up on spelling car parts ), $900.  Axle - $250, and of course the regular maintenance.  But the warranty covered the rings in the transmission (standard) which would have cost me 2,000!!! Unbelievable.  I only had the car for 6 months when all of this happened.  Parts for the Mitsubishi motor are outrageously expensive.  I guess I should have researched the car more carefully before buying it.  So I sold the car within the next 6 months.  I heard the problems you could have with the belt within the motor if not replaced every 80,000 kms and I sold it as fast as I could.  I had minor problems as well.  The hatch fell on my head, the radio died, and in the winter, it froze up solid.  One pro besides its appearance is that it was great on winter roads.<br><br>
