            I purchased a demo 1997 Mercury Sable in March 1997 it had 4,000 miles.  After a few days of driving I heard an odd groaning sound when making turns, whether they were lefts, or rights, or wide or normal. When I pointed this out to the dealer and they tested they stated that they never hear these sounds.  I find the steering is very loose and the transmission seems to be slipping.  If the car is designed with this type of steering - did anyone else experience these problems or is this normal.  The service people are always very nice, but they don't seem to be hearing me.  I have driven many cars in my life and this really bothers me.  Other than that I enjoy the styling and the comfort of the car.<br><br>
