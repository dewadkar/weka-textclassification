                My Silverado is a 4.3L 5 speed. It is perky enough, doesn't gulp gas and handles well. Good tough paint job. Poor fit on bed. B traction grade tires don't do brakes justice. Short front suspension travel causes a rough ride, bumps travel through truck.  

    The passenger seat belt is best described as a choke belt because when you stop hard it locks and does not release. It has been replaced once. The passenger seat when empty has a irritating habit of rattling loud when I hit a good sized bump. I have had it in the shop several times and the dealer is unable to fix the problem. 

     The passenger compartment is small for a full sized truck. There is hardly any useable room behind the seat, and is really not a three seater with the 5 speed. The plastic facing beneath the rear window is very temperature sensitive.

     Too much emphasis on &quot;safety&quot; features. I am a grown up. Lights that come on automatically sometimes have disadvantages. So do doors that requires unlocking when opening from the inside. <br><br>
