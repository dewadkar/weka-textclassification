            I have owned a 2000 Subaru Forester for a little over one year. Soon after the purchase I experienced the first problem with the "Check engine" light coming on, indicating something was wrong somewhere.. Now after 5 more occurences of the same problem and the repairs these incidents required I no longer wish to own a car that appears unrepairable and is very likely to be a future financial drain to me.
I attempted to get assistance through the maintenance department of the  dealer ship who just told me that
 " These things happen to all the new cars these days, you did not close your gas cap tightly enough or you must have over filled your car."
The factory representatives politely listened but did nothing that resembled any kind of real assistance.
I am now in buy back negotiations with Subaru per lemon law. The process has been ongoing for more than 5 weeks and is still not complete. I initiated the procedures after over one  year of mechanical problems, it was not offered by the company... I consider the assistance Subaru offerd to be slow and inefficient, as well as customer unfriendly. I treated well before I bought the car.... whatever happened to customer service after the purchase?? My correspondence, e-mails and phone calls were not responded to most of the time. I was offered a new 2001 Forester but turned it down because of the poor customer care. No, I would not buy another Subaru.
