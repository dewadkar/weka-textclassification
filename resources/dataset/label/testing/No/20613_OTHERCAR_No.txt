            I've held this current Audi A4 in high regard since its introduction as a '98 model. With its balanced chassis, exquisitely detailed interior, distinctive sheetmetal, and excellent overall package, the A4 was compelling. But one thing was missing -- stirring performance. I am not sure about the A4 but the turbocharged V-6 delivers 250 hp with Audi's characteristic minimal lag and gutsy low-end thrust. Available with a six-speed manual or a five-speed automatic, this engine gives the A6 eight-cylinder performance for the price of its six-cylinder rivals. For those who simply must have a V-8, the A6 is available with a new 300-hp 40-valve version of the 4.2-liter V-8 that debuted in Audi's flagship A8. In addition to effortless performance, the A6 4.2 is fitted with a high level of luxury accoutrements that give it a completely different feel from its 2.7T sibling. And it also comes with an attractive price.With this newfound power, the A6s have the all-around excellence that moves them to the head of the luxury-sedan class.	<br><br>
