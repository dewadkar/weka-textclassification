            Having owned one Sable and also rented many Mercury Sables and Ford Taurus, I have come to enjoy the ride that these 2 automobiles provide.  Both provide good legroom, support, and smooth ride.  I've especially liked the feeling of the wrap around cab when in a Sable that has bucket style seats.  The gas mileage is reasonable, and the trunk gives you a lot space for large suitcases and golf bags.   That is the GOOD news.

I own a Sable and am the original owner. The automobile has never been in a wreck.  I must say that the engine block is in great condition, and does not burn oil or get hot.  The automobile has been serviced regularly every 3000 - 5000 miles, including many areas that sometimes don't get serviced as they should be (transmissions, etc...).  From about 10000 miles forward, it has been a mechanic's dream.  The water pump has been replaced 3 times.  The power steering unit never has been right from the day I purchased the automobile.  It has been replaced or serviced on 6 occasions.  The air conditioning system has been repaired on 2 different occasions, including refitting for the new freon capability.  The front end does not even begin to stay in line for a reasonable amount of mileage.  Within 300 or so miles after an alignment (several different shops have performed alignments), the car wants to pull to the left.  This has been looked at from several different aspects, and no one has been able to cure.   The electrical system has been faulty, including replacement of the alternator 2 times.   That's the BAD NEWS.  

SO,  would I buy another one?   No Way.  Would I rent a new one on a trip? Probably.    Good side is a good comfortable ride.  The down side is a car whose parts wear out before they should reasonably be expected to wear out..
