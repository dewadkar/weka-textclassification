            My husband bought this truck brand new in the most beautiful silver and blue color.  This was one nice looking truck.....car....whatever.

I say the above because with the 2 wheel drive version my car could haul better then this truck.  We bought this vehicle because we wanted a small truck to do some household chores, no large hauling.  When we drove it home (we bought it in a different town) we got 30 miles to the gallon, we were thrilled.  The only problem is we drove it home going 55 mph because it was new and when we actually drove it the speed limit it got more like 15 miles to the gallon.

After 3 months we took it in for a check up and found out the shocks were leaking already and had to be replaced.  This truck had never been on a bad road and was completely babied.  We thought maybe it was just a simple defect from the factory, until they went bad again 3 months later and had to be replaced once again.

The other problem had was with the alignment.  The whole time we owned the truck we could never get it to align and it continuously chewed up tires.  We finally decided we no longer needed it and sold it before the warranty ran out.

One of our friends at the same time had bought a brand new Sanoma also and the main computer went out and had to be replaced.  A few months later this happened again to them and then again a few months after that.  As the computer was being replaced the third time they decided to trade it in and buy a different vehicle.

These are great looking little trucks, but GMC needs to spend a little more time on quality and a little less on flair.
