            I recently used a Olympus D-490 Zoom, and a less expensive Sony DSC-S30, and compared the two.

The Olympus looks better, and seems more 'classy'.  The Sony has more gadgets.  Also, the Olympus is 2.1 megapixel, while the Sony is not (and the Sony is therefore cheaper).

The lens technology in the Olympus is better, and it should take better pictures; I would say this is more targeted at the semi-pro, while the Sony is more targeted at tech buffs who want to take decent pictures.

Why am I mentioning the Sony so much?  Well, even though the Olympus has better resolution and optics, something about it bugs me.

For starters, the Olympus doesn't come with a AC adaptor; you have to buy one separately.  The batteries are rechargable, but it isn't useable without the adaptor.

Second, there is no USB interface included; it is serial.  They have a free USB offer right now, but it is 6-8 weeks for delivery.  In my opinion, it should be included.

Also, the Sony is usable as a hard disc, and is VERY computer friendly (my folks can use it no problem).  The Olympus can do most of the job, but it isn't as friendly.

Overall, it seems that a better overall camera loses marks because of lack of some stuff important in a DIGITAL camera, which is easy of transfer to other platforms.  I like it, mind you, but they could make it better.<br><br>
