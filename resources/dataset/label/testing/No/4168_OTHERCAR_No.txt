            We rented this from Enterprise last year on a long weekend so this is not so much an ownership review but more like a test drive over a few days.

The only problem is that I cannot recall which model except that it was the 4-door version of either the DeVille or SeVille.

We had never driven a caddy before and it was great.
It was BIG - big seats, big trunk, big engine (about 4 L with 275 hp not very efficient though).
The ride was the smoothest of any car we had been in.

I made sure I hit every pothole I saw during our 1 hour trip out of Atlanta on 400 North.
It was amazing - you barely felt the biggest holes - just the 'ka-thunk' noise as the car glided over them.

Its a great freeway cruiser and we took it upto 100 mph almost effortlessly.
Then we felt a little scared and slowed down to 90!
There was no loss of control at any point.

The max cruising speed in this is around 100 mph.

The audio controls on the wheel made a big difference and reduced the distraction of looking at the radio/cd to change channels/tracks.

The trunk popped up on hydraulics so a small person could use it without effort.
The best part about it was the fact that it automatically locked shut if you pulled it down more than halfway and left it.

The major downside was that it left you so disconnected from the road that you could easily fall asleep driving it!
Also the rear visibility is poor since the back window is pretty small.
The rear view mirror needs to be larger to reduce your blind spots.
This car would benefit greatly from the small circular convex mirrors that people stick on the side mirrors ($3-5).

It also handles like a boat since its a large car.
Of course its a gas guzzler - did you expect anything less from a Caddy?!
