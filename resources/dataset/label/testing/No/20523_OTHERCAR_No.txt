            I bought this car 2 years ago for $3000.  It was cheap because it came with 120,000 miles on it.  The guy I bought it from did a lot of business out of town, so he was always on the road.  I told myself, "at least they're highway miles..."  It now has about 150,000 miles it.
I have had some very expensive problems with the car recently.
1) A metal tube going from the water pump to the engine cost me $600, because I have the Quad4 engine, which is apparently a PAIN to work around.  The mechanic had to take all sorts of things apart in order to replace the little tube.
2) My heater core died.  This repair was also going to be in the neighborhood of $600, mostly for labor costs.  Luckily, it doesn't get too cold where I live, so I had the mechanic block the heater instead.
3) The radiator fan motor died.  The third time in as many months that I witnessed a pool of antifreeze on the ground under my car.  Grumble, grumble...
I'm sure these repairs would have been cheaper if I had gone to a different mechanic.  And these things are probably to be expected from a car with 150K miles on it.
BUT, there are so many other aspects of the car that I dislike, for instance:
As others have mentioned, the front seating angle is TERRIBLE.  Maybe it is exacerbated because I am tall.  After a 3-hour road trip, my back, neck, and legs hurt.
Also, the automatic lock controls stopped working.  It is very irritating, because when you put the car in drive, all four doors lock, and when you turn the car off, all four doors un-lock.  Thus, I am left to manually lock all 4 doors every time I get out of the car.  A major source of irritation.
Another thing:  Since I have had the car, the "check engine" light has come on three times.  Each time has been the same problem: the throttle position sensor (TPS), which tells the car how much gas to use.  I don't know if this recurring problem is a characteristic of all the models or just mine.
What else?  The car is NOT my style.  I bought it because it was affordable and I needed a car fast.  Other people seem to like how it looks, though.  It just depends on your taste.  
So, all this adds up to one unhappy driver.  If I wasn't already in so much debt, I would be selling this baby and buying a newer, better car in a heartbeat.
