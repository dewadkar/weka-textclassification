            We purchased our 1995 Pontiac Transport new from what we thought was a reputable dealer. We were so excited to have a large car where I would not be cramped in the back seat caring for our toddler. We purchased the built in car seats, which were the only good thing about the van. We were talked into spending money on the roof rack which we NEVER used. But all in all, we were initially thrilled with our purchase.

Now, granted, we used the car a LOT. In 1.5 years, we put 36,800 miles on the car. But we had trouble with the car after only one month. That is when the computer system started giving us trouble. However, every time we brought it back to the dealer, the trouble stopped. The REAL trouble started 800 miles over the warranty. That is when the transmission blew it's cookies. Yes, the transmission went on a car less than 2 years old. The dealer &quot;covered&quot; half the repairs (after I threatened to sue them), but as we found out later, instead of doing a $1,600 job, they did an $800 job and said they paid half. Since I cannot prove this in a court of law, I will not divulge the name of the dealer.

We found out about the poor job 12.5 months later, one half month past the warranty when this transmission also blew its cookies. We had another one installed at a cost of $2,000. One month later, this new transmission blew up (yes, literally BLEW UP). My husband and I were forced to push the van out of the middle of the road. This was not an easy task especially since I was recovering from a broken ankle. At that time I wanted to throw in the towel, but my husband is the ultimate optimist.

The mechanic said that the van itself was causing the problems. He replaced this transmission and a month later, the radiator went. Even though we replaced the radiator, we decided we (actually my husband) FINALLY had enough. Personally, I gave up on the van years ago. Four transmissions on a car 4 years old was too much. The breakdowns, 4 transmissions, 6 sets of brakes, 4 new sets of tires, a broken driver seat without an accident (it snapped off while my husband was driving, we are lucky he was not killed), electrical problems, computer problems, broken starter, radiator, battery and countless other items that needed replacing in the 4+ years we owned it and the general unreliability of the vehicle were too much to handle. We knew the people at Enterprise Car Rental on a first name basis and started getting volume discounts.  We are thinking of inviting them over for barbecues from now on.

We traded it in for an Olds and vowed we would NEVER again buy another Pontiac. We do not believe in paying that much money for trash. By the way, as we drove it into the dealership to trade it in, the BRAND NEW radiator blew its cookies.<br><br>
