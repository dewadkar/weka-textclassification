            I had to rent a car for a one week period when my car was being repaired, and the rental agency gave me a <b>Daewoo Nubira</b>.  I figured hey, it was a 2001 car, had a nice, sleek look, and would be fun to drive for a week. Fun is not exactly the word I am using for the experience at this point in time. 

It took me a couple of minutes to figure it out, as my regular car is a stick shift and the rental was an automatic, but I soon got into the groove and drove out of the parking lot into the roadway.  

My first impression was not terribly bad.  Granted, I only drove about six miles from the rental place to my job, so I really didn't have much of a frame of reference on which to base an opinion one way or another.  The engine ran smoothly and the car got me to work on time and in one piece.  After two more days of driving, however, I was dreading the rest of the time frame I was going to have to drive the car.  With three daughters in the house, I tend to drive a lot.  Someone always has to go somewhere!  It is the rare occasion where I can come home from work and just relax without having to run several errands.

Because of this, it took me just a few days to make some firm opinions about the <b>Daewoo Nubira</b>.  It may be a 2001 edition, but I am completely unimpressed with this vehicle.  To be fair, I will list what the car does have before I go into detail about the things that irritated me.

<b>Features of the 2001 Daewoo Nubira</b>

<i>Keyless entry.</i> By keyless entry, I mean that the key has the remote control device that allows you to lock and unlock the doors while outside the vehicle.  I have always like this as a security feature; first, it enables me to get into my vehicle quickly without fumbling with a key in the lock (always nice in dark parking lots) and secondly, it eliminates the risk of locking my keys inside the vehicle.

<i>Child safety locks.</i> My youngest child is now aged nine, but I still occasionally use the child safety locks if we are going somewhere that I don't want to risk my child opening the door at the wrong time. 

<i>Power locks and windows</i>.  I don't think I could survive in a car that didn't have these.  Very convenient features.

<i>Windshield wipers</i>.  This car has several speeds on the wipers, including intermittent.  This may seem odd for me to mention, but I have driven newer vehicles that did not have the intermittent function and it drove me nuts.

<i>Trunk space</i>.  The trunk is roomy, and easily held the many groceries I purchased one of the days I drove it.  With three children in the house we go through a lot of food, and I try to make as few trips to the store as possible.  I had no problem fitting quite a few groceries neatly in the trunk of this car. 
 
<b>Things I Don't Like</b>

<i>Interior design</i>.  This has to be one of the most inconvenient cars I have ever driven. It took me three days to discover where the cup holder was hidden, and at that I was not even the one who found it.  My nine-year-old daughter located it!  It is in the center console at the bottom, underneath the radio.  In the place where one would find the CD player in most cars.  Ridiculous.  The lights and windshield wiper controls are standard on the steering column, thank goodness, but most of the other controls took a while to locate, figure out, and use safely.  The window controls are on the doors, which makes it difficult to adjust the windows and concentrate on driving at the same time, as an example.  

<i>Seats</i>.  I have never had the misfortune of driving a more uncomfortable car than the <b>2001 Daewoo Nubira</b>.  I spent a long time looking at the seats, but never did figure out what specifically was causing the discomfort.  It has to be the design of the seats themselves.  At any rate, my back was hurting after fairly short drives, and that is not a good thing.  I suffer from fibromyalgia due to an assault a few years back and uncomfortable seats in the car just doesn't work for me.

<i>Visibility</i>.  The design of the seats makes it very difficult to adequately look behind before making lane changes, which made me very nervous while driving this vehicle.  

<i>Space</i>.  This car is built to hold five people, or so the manual says.   But they had better be five little people, or they better plan on having a cramped, uncomfortable ride.  My teenagers, who are not big girls, were complaining that they did not have enough room in the back seat.  The front seats also feel cramped, which doesn't help matters any.

<i>Power</i>.  Granted, this car has a four cylinder engine so one would not necessarily expect great power and performance. But I think it goes beyond that; my best description for this car would be "gutless".  Maintaining a steady speed up a hill is next to impossible.  


<b>Final Assessment</b>

My sixteen-year-old daughter absolutely fell in love with this car.  That is not totally surprising, considering she just got her driver's license and loves to drive an automatic.  (She is terrified of my stick shift but will have to figure it out if she wants to drive anywhere!).  The car does have a sleek look, but beauty is skin deep and the sleek look is not worth the numerous inconveniences in my opinion.

The car did run well the entire time I drove it, and I did not experience any kind of mechanical difficulties at all.  The stereo provided reasonable sound, a big plus when driving with teenagers in the car. Gas mileage in city driving was reasonable; after a week of driving I had not even used a half a tank of gas. I just can't justify the pluses when I consider the negatives, however.  

My significant other listened to me complain about this car and finally said I should understand it is a "disposable" car.  You drive it into the dirt and throw it away.  He could be right.  But at a price tag of around ten thousand dollars, I would expect a bit more than that from a vehicle. Maybe I am behind the times!

If you want a cramped, uncomfortable car you might consider purchasing the <b>2001 Daewoo Nubira</b>.  I would not, however, consider purchasing this car under any circumstances. I spend far too much time in the car playing chauffeur to drive one that does not meet my needs.  I'll stick to my 1996 Saturn for now at any rate until I find something I like better!
