                 I originally bought this camera because of the price--after rebate, it was under $100.00.  (The camera I received did not include the cradle or base in the picture on this site.)  It was simple to learn how to use and produced pictures good enough for sharing on the internet.  
     The software package included was nice, also. It contained a version of Adobe PhotoDeluxe, Vistacam, and the software for the camera itself.  It also interfaced well with the Ulead PhotoImpact software already on my computer.  It does not have a flash, but it adjusts to available lighting very well and has different settings for different types of light sources.  
     On the down side, when shooting in low light, any movement of the camera or subject will cause blurring, but this was not a major problem.  
     Initially I was quite pleased with this camera and thought I had found a bargain.
     HOWEVER, after not quite one week of steady but not excessive use, it stopped working.  It failed to communicate with the computer.  
     The first call to customer service left me with three pages of instructions on how to uninstall and reinstall my SCANNER drivers, which wasn't the problem.  A second call walked me through a step-by-step trouble-shooting process, which determined that the camera was defective.  I was given a RMA number by the site from which I had purchased the camera, and I returned it for an incredibly prompt full refund.
     All in all, this isn't a bad camera (assuming most of their products have a better track record than the one I received).  If you're looking for a no-frills, simple to operate digital camera, this is for you (just keep all your receipts in case it dies after a week like mine did).
     Today I received its replacement in the mail...an RCA CDS1005;  $20.00 cheaper plus a flash!<br><br>
