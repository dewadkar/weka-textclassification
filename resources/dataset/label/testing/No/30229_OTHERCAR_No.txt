              My boyfriend purchased this camera because he wanted a starter camera and he had heard some raves about the camera.  Well we got it home, pulled it out and started reading the instructions and figuring out what it could all do.  Then we started taking pictures, and thats where everything bad happened.

  It took the pictures and saved them for us, it has a pretty good sized hold amount.  But then we hooked it up to the computer to download the pictures and what we saw were some of the worst pictures (quality wise) that I have ever seen!  All of the pictures were fuzzy and distorted.  At first we thought it was just us, but then we followed the instructions to the letter and still had the same results.  We tried over and over again to get a clear picture, but it never worked that way.

  And then we finally had to delete some of the pictures to make room, we were just going to delete all of the pictures.  Except that it wouldn't let us.  It kept giving us error messages and such.  So that never really worked properly either.  

  I do have to say that because of the size it was pretty easy to use.  I have small hands so some of the bigger digital cameras I have a lot of problems using because of their size.  But this one was ok.

  The other problem that we had with this camera was that the batteries died way too fast.  We would have the thing completely shut off and when we turned it on again it would tell us that the batteries were dead and wouldn't work.  We thought maybe it was just the batteries that came with the camera, but then we changed those and it still happened.  We could use the camera only occasionally and it had to be turned off right away, but that still didn't save the batteries either!

  So if you want a good digital camera I would say go else where.  If you want just a starter that your kids might like to play around with, this might be an option, but I still can't bring myself to recommend this camera to anyone!
