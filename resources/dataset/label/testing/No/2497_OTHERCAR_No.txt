            I purchased my Neon in August of 2001.  Now that I have driven it for a year, I feel I am now able to form a good opinion. 
When I first test drove the car, I was very pleased with its comfy seats, spacious interior and pep.  For a 4 cylinder, this car can move, and gets about 28 miles to the gallon driving highway and city.  It can easily seat 5 full grown adult, and the seats are super soft.  Also, it has child safety locks, and anchors for car seats(very important since I have a child).  All that being said, I bought it.  I paid a little over $15,000, which I thought was a steal considering the options it came with(power locks, power windows, keyless entry, 4 disc CD changer, security alarm, etc.)
After having it for a month, one of the power window motors broke and needed to be replaced.  Then, just this past summer, I noticed I was getting a swimming pool on the rear passenger side floor.  The dealership wound up replacing all of the molding in the trunk, and resealing the rear tail lights.  Then, last week, the clock spring in the steering wheel snapped while I was driving(very scary).  Now, being that the car is under warranty, all of the repairs were done at no charge, but then I think to myself, I have owned the car for a little over a year and have had to bring it back 3 times.  How many things are going to break when the warranty runs out?  Now I understand that cars have many moving part, and things will break, but I have owned other cars in the past that didn't breakdown this often.
Now onto customer service.  This may just be the dealership I bought the car from and not the Chrysler corporation(the verdict is not in yet), I have received the worst customer service.  The most recent time I brought the car in, they had my car for 5 days.  The first 3 and half days, it sat in the lot untouched.  The next day was spent ordering the part, and the last half day was for the actual repair.  All of that time, I was not given a loaner car, and I had to rent a car at my own expense.  I find this horrific considering that this was not something I was even capable of breaking.  I am currently contacting the Chrysler corporation, and will update this review when I get their response.
