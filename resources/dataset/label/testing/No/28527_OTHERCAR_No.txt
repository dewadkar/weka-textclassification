            Outside of going to war in Iraq I see little use for the off-road capabilities of the Hummer. When it gets right down to it the overall purpose of a vehicle is to get you from point A to point B in comfort and style. Now the Hummer definitely gives you the style points however for real world practicality and base engineering it is surely lacking. It offers little cargo space due to its low roofline and the huge spare tire and wheel bolted into the back seat area. The spare is inside, chewing up space, but covered up nicely. Maximum cargo space is listed as 86.6 cubic feet with all the rear seats folded down, short of some of some standard full sized SUZ&#146s like the Acura MDX and the Honda Pilot. 

The interior cabin is rather quiet and you can easily hear people talking from back to front. The interior affords some poor visibility with some interior parts taken from the Pontiac Aztek SUV; other interior components are taken from GM's pickup truck and SUV parts bins, which in my opinion leads to an average feeling at best.

Seats are thick, comfortable and supportive and keep you centered when driving off-road at odd angles. The shifter is a bit of design overkill, with a big, round, shiny handle that's meant to bring macho indoors but takes up too much space doing it. 

Performance is adequate at best giving you 0-60 in about 10 seconds but it definitely doesn&#146t reach the 8 seconds that other SUV&#146s are reaching these days. Off-Road it does excel but how often do you drive through a swamp??? 

Overall it is a quantum leap over the prior version but it still lacks in the basic concept of a true street ready vehicle&#133
