            *****UPDATE*****

Well, the car ended up sitting for 4 months while I tried to save up the cash to get the tranny replaced.  I finally got it done in March.  Unfortunately the new one didn't work either - well, it worked better than the old, quite a bit better actually, but it was still pretty awful.  It never occurred to me to tell the mechanic about the speedometer/odometer problems until then.  He suspected it might be the speedo sensor on the transaxle (or something to that effect).  He replaced that, and not only did the new tranny work fine, but the speedometer and odometer worked fine too.  The mechanic said it was likely that the faulty sensor was putting the tranny under a lot of stress, and that it was the reason the old tranny went.  This was a bloody $95 part.  Not a $580 printed circuit board like the dealership had told me.  And if the dealership had any brains they would have known this and done something about it before it was too late.  

So with that done, I decided to sell the car.  The day before I was about to buy an add in the paper, the car decided it wasn't going to start.  Wasn't even going to turn over.  It had a 1 week old battery, so I knew it wasn't that.  Had it towed to an electrical specialist.  The micro-switch in the door needed to be replaced.  While it was there I asked him to look into the heat controls and windshield wiper problems.  After trying many things he found he could get them to come on and off by hitting the fuse box.  I couldn't sell the car like that, so I had to have the fuse box replaced.

After another huge bill, everything seemed good, it wasn't even overheating anymore for some reason.  The car was working the best it had worked since 3 months after I bought it.  It felt absolutely wonderful.  I fell in love again, and decided I was not going to sell it.  Then the last straw...

I was driving down the very curvy and hilly highway at night with my brights on when another car was coming towards me.  I turned off my brights - no big deal, right?  Well ALL the lights went off.  I was on a curve, blinded by the lights of the guy coming towards me (who must have been pretty freaked out since I had just "disappeared") and almost went into the ditch.  Somehow I managed to turn them back on and stay out of the ditch, but when I got home I found out I couldn't turn the lights off anymore.  Had to disconnect the light switch module to turn them off.  It was quite easy to find a used part, and it was easily fixed, but that last thing jolted me back into reality that this was never going to end.  There would always be something ready to go, and it was making me paranoid.

This past weekend, I traded it in for a 2001 Ford Focus SE.  The saga has ended.  But every time I see a Jetta III driving down the road I feel a bit sad, because after all, it was my dream car...

********************************************************

I remember the first time I saw the Jetta III.  I had just received my acceptance letter into college and when I saw that shiny white car, I told myself, someday I will have one.  

That day was August 27, 1999.  I was so thrilled, not only did I have my very first car, but it was the car I had wanted for so many years.  I didn't even mind that it was purple.  It was so much fun to drive, and the fact that it had no power didn't bother me at all considering I was so used to driving my mother's 3 cylinder '91 Subaru Justy or my Dad's old '86 Hyundai Pony beater.  3 months went by and I loved it more and more every day.  Then things started to go wrong.  

The list goes as such:

1.)  Wire harness - broken wires were found and had to be replaced.  I have been told by several mechanics that this should NEVER have happened and no one understands why it did.

2.)  Tires - was told by the dealership that it had new tires when I bought it.  Found out that was a lie when I took it out on our first snowfall together.  Came out of the parking lot going as fast as a snail and slid into the curb.  When I went back to the dealership, they said 3 months had gone by, so it's out of their hands.  Took it to Fountain tire.  They said that the front tires were completely bald and the rear were 20%.  The dealership still refused to do anything.

3.)  Distributor and camshaft sensor replacement

4.)  Timing belt and engine seals replaced - was also told by several mechanics that it should have lasted much longer.

5.)  Engine flutter - no one can find where it's coming from

6.)  Runs far too hot - have to top up the coolant every few weeks.  Had the thermostat replaced, didn't help.  Currently looking into what else it could be.  Two mechanics suspect it's the head gasket.

7.)  Front disc brakes replaced

8.)  Speedometer / odometer - they work intermittently and always in synch.  It's been determined that the circuit board behind the dash has to be replaced.  It's a $580 part.  Like I can afford that with all the other problems going on with this hunk of junk.  Meanwhile the thing's racking up kilometers that aren't being registered by the odometer.

9.)  Dash vibration of the week - changes constantly in both intensity and location.

10.)  Signal lights don't work when cold - this one's good for entertaining passengers.  Starts out fine, then starts clicking slower and slower til it starts making little high-pitched grindy noises, then they stop altogether til I turn the wheel.

11.)  Heat controls and windshield wipers work when they feel like it, usually when the car hasn't warmed up yet.  Gotta love trying to drive on slushy roads with no windshield wipers.

12.)  Pieces of dash fall off from time to time.

13.)  Transmission - here's the biggie and the most current.  3 days ago it decided that from now on it was going to refuse to go into gear right away.  I have to put my foot on the gas to rev it up a bit before it jackrabbits into gear.  Then each gear shift makes a big "clunk".  At the moment the car is sitting in front of my house being useless as I take the bus to work.

Needless to say, I hate this car now.  I am so completely crushed that the car of my dreams has turned into the lemon of my worst nightmares.  Mechanics cannot believe I've only had this car for just over a year.
