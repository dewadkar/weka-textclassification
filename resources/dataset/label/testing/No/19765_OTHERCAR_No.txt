            I purchased a 1998 Mazda 626 LX with the luxury package.  I paid $23,000 for the car.  It currently has 36,000 miles on it and I have been looking into buying another car.  I have checked into the retail value of the car and it has been cut in half from the amount I paid for the car three years ago.  That is very depressing.  At this point, I am under on the car and if I decide to get rid of it I have to sell it out right and come out with nothing.  When I purchased the car I was told how good the resale value was.  I contemplated on buying a Honda Accord or the Mazda 626.  A close friend owned a Honda Civic that costs $7,000 less than my car and received a better trade-in value than I did.  It really makes me upset to know that now I have to either get out of the car now, keep in for 3 more years, or come out in the end with nothing.  I really love the car, but did not realize how much the value of the car decreased.  The car is great to drive and very comfortable, but there are many reasons why Mazda may not be the best to buy.<br>Sincerely,<br>Monica<br>Texas City, Texas<br><br><br>
