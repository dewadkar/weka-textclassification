            I lease a Chevy Blazer.  When I picked it up, it had 1,200 miles on it (it was driven by a higher-level General Motors employee for two months) which was fine, given that I was getting a swell discount.  I think it's fair to give a review on a vehicle only after having it for at least a year -- and I've had this one for 1.5 years (3 year lease).

Here's the run down.  1998, black 4-door, fully loaded 4WD, anti-lock, CD-player, charcoal leather interior, sun/moon roof, power this, and power that.

The three main points:

Safety.  Dual airbags.  Anti-lock brakes (which I have engaged quite a few times here in Michigan winters).  Size -- big.  It's not the biggest sport-utility on the road; however, statistically, you're chances are better than if you were in a smaller compact vehicle in the event of an accident (knock on wood).

Roomy.  Three adults can easily fit in the back seat area.  And as for making room for moving stuff?  Fold down the two back seats with a single plastic flip on the back of each seat, and you've just created loads of cargo space.  On the four-door, the spare tire is underneath, which means you can pop the rear window open if you need to place long items in, such as 10 or 12 foot 2x4's. (not recommended, by the way)

Zoomy.  The truck can move.  While it's not the most gas economical vehicle on the road, the trade off for acceleration and top end is a fair exchange.  The truck handles much like a car, and corners very well, also.

So far, sounds great -- but what do I dislike about the Blazer?

Rear-window wiper does not have variable timing, other than SLOW and FAST. It would be nice to have an intermittent delay, such as the front wipers.

Gas economy.  Truth be told, I didn't lease this truck for the gas economy, but boy, it sure would be handy to squeeze a few more MPG on those long trips.  My results are about 17/23 (city/highway).  Your results may vary.

No rear blowers for HVAC.  My good friend has a Ford Explorer, and my brother has a mini-van -- both which have rear-seat vents and independent variable speed blowers for heat/air-conditioning.  The Blazer lacks this feature (was this an option I overlooked? -- possible).

The summary: For a SUV, I think the Blazer is hard to beat.  It's priced right, it drives like a car, get's decent mileage, seems quite reliable in the 1.5 years I've driven it, and you feel safe driving it.  Very solid, well crafted mobile, and tons of gadgets and gizmos if you get it fully loaded (electronic compass, trip/miles/DTE computer).  It's a quiet ride, and at the same time, great to go trail 4-wheeling in (take it slow, of course).

If you're in the market for an SUV, you'd be a fool if you didn't test drive a Blazer.  The four-door, by the way, is HIGHLY recommended.<br><br>
