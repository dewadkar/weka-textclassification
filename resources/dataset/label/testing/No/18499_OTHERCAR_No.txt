            Ford and GM didn't have a clue what hit them the day that VW, decided to slap them in the face with a big phat VW Passat...  Definitely a mid level luxury sedan, with all the trimmings fit for a king...  Lets review:

<b>Aesthetic Values</b>

Want the trimmings??  Well, this mother is loaded with silver from head to toe, errr hood to trunk... ? ;)  Every single gauage is shiny, so very shiny... it definitely has the feel of a royal coach.. Unfortunately, if you are one of the types, that doesn't like all that bling, this car could be a little bit much for you.  Everything about it from it's clear-lensed headcap clusters to it's chromed out grills... this car is definitely a fancy piece of machinery.. Even the thinly pressed sheet metal is beautiful on this beast...

The wood trim... looks as if they just chopped down the tree and treated it.  The gears are clean and look as if you hand made them yourself..  Every last detail has been refined to make this a much cleaner look Passat, much different than the pre- 1998 verions...  This is definitely a push in the direction of Audi-like characteristics..


<b>Performance</b>

UCKKKKKKK!!!!  I hated driving this car, not because it was fun and comfortable, but because it's handling sucked hardcore!  Every single turn or change of lanes seemed to be too laborious and I felt like I was lugging around a huge thing behind me... sure I'm used to my Toyota Celica, but this was definitely a huge rear or a heavy vehicle that didn't manuever very well at all..

Other than that, the vehicle has 9 different engines that it offers, some of which aren't offered in the states, including the 280 Horsepower V-8...  Why?  Well, if they did that then, they'd be in direct competition with pricing with Audi and if that were the case, they'd definitely lose, because they have got nothing on the Audi...  They are even offering several diesel engines to choose from.

<b>Overall</b>

Overall you are basically just buying a very fancy looking overweighted boat with a whole lot of features and functionality..  The car itself is quite impressive on the inside, while not looking all that definitive and unique on the outside.  There is nothing that really stands out about the vehicle and doesn't really scream at you to buy it or even really give it a second glance, unless the sun is shining on all the silver interior, which is what will definitely make the sales pitch for the salesperson...

The ride is the most unconvincing ride ever with no control over the vehicle if you are trying to make sudden moves into a lane or trying to take a tight corner...  This vehicle is definitely a really big feeling beast and it's uncomfortable driving a vehicle that you are so uncertain about whether or not you're going to kareen someone while trying to overtake them.

The overall space of the vehicle is quite impressive and you could store more people in it than most other vehicles in it's class for sure...  

Overall, I recommend the Audi anything over the Passat, but if you are willing to spend nearly $30K on a vehicle that doesn't perform up to standard, then that's your perogative...
