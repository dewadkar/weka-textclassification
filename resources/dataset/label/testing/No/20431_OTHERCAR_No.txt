            A friend of mine owns a 2000 Volkswagen Jetta. My fiance and I recently had the chance to take his car for a little test drive since we are starting to look for a new car. He was out of town and said that we could see for ourselves why the Jetta is one of the &quot;best cars on the market.&quot; Being the trusting soul, I relented because it was a Volkswagen. Sleek, German engineering, world-class features and the like. But the hype didn't live up to our experience driving in it.

The Jetta is a midsize vehicle with lots of horsepower and a fresh new design. This vehicle also has just a few flaws as well. If you are a single person, this car is a perfect fit for your lifestyle. If you have a family, then this is definitely NOT the car for you! We transported a child in this vehicle, and the toddler kept hitting her feet against the back of the seat. The front seats are roomy, but the back seats are cramped for the average sized adult passenger. The seats themselves are relatively comfortable, but the head rests are very uncomfortable indeed.

Climate controls, power windows and power steering are strong features of the vehicle. Controls are easily accessible and all of the options are easily within reach. Our friend has a key that pops out like a switchblade. The car alarm and locks are conveniently located on the keyring. I was told that this option costs around $200! We almost got it stuck in the ignition TWICE while it was in park. That's NOT supposed to happen with a $200 option, is it? That's a little excessive for a car key. The trunk is so spacious that you could almost put a bed inside! The car retains its sporty image, but something tells me that there are other cars in the mid-size class that are a little better buys than the Jetta.

The Jetta does have some decent features, but we weren't particularly impressed with the vehicle. We would much prefer a larger vehicle with about the same power and more room, preferably the Chevrolet Malibu or Pontiac Grand Am, which probably cost less than the Jetta even with the base package. I am giving the Jetta a mixed review---and we're definitely not gonna &quot;getta&quot; Jetta!<br><br>
