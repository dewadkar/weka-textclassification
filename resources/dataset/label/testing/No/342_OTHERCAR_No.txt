            I decided to testdrive the new 2000 Nissan XTerra because i've been seeing a lot of them on the road lately and thought they were a really good looking SUV.  Of course, looks are only one part of the overall driving experience.  I was not impressed with the rest of the XTerra.

<b>Engine</b>
     From the moment I started to drive the new XTerra, I noticed the lack of power that the engine provided.  There are two types of engines that the new XTerra's are equipted with.  The first is a 170hp, 3.3 liter, V6.  The second option is a 143hp, V4.  I testdrove the V6.  The lack of &quot;pickup&quot; was very disappointing to me as I was driving.  Everytime I pressed down on the accelerator, the SUV hesitated and then crawled to the higher speeds.  Almost everytime the SUV accelerated, the tachometer was redlined which shows me that there would not have been a huge difference if I drove an automatic. (Yes, I did drive a automatic for the testdrive since no standards were available.)  In no way an I inplying that the XTerra should drive like a sportscar, but it should not drag either.  There are many other SUVs on the market with a lot more power.
      As with all SUVs the gas mileage is terrible.  The sticker said the XTerra will get 19 highway and 15 city.  As you can see, with gas prices are the levels they are right now, you will be paying big bucks to drive this SUV anywhere.

<b>Inside</b>
     I was not that impressed with the inside of the XTerra either.  The front seats has a spacious amount of room, but the backseats seemed a little crapped for an SUV.  Again, I am not comparing the leg/head room to a four door sedan, I am just comparing it to other SUVs on the market.  The standard radio is one really nice feature about the XTerra.  It comes with a standard 6 speaker and CD player.  The speakers are very nice and can be played at a high volume without any distortion.  The gauges are set up nicely and are easily accessable.  The same can be said about the air conditioning/heat controls. 

<b>Outside</b>
     This is the one area that attracted me to this SUV in the first place.  Without the looks, I would have never even testdrove the XTerra.  The outside is very attactive.  The sport utility rack on the top of the XTerra is a nice addition and gives the SUV more of a &quot;rugged&quot; look.  It is quoted as being able to safely hold 125 pounds.  Their are step up bars that allow passengers to get in and exit the vehicle a lot easier.  The tires are a P265/70R15 size so they are quite large.  (And expensive to replace.)

<b>Price</b>
     In my opinion, the XTerra is way overpriced.  With the lack of power under the hood, it seems as though Nissan is selling this SUV more on appearance, then on anything else.  The low end models (XE) are priced at around $18,000.  This includes a standard, striped down, V4.  I would not recommend this model at all since I drove the V6 and it was sluggish.  The high end model (SE) starts at around $23,000.  These prices are base prices.  While I was at the lot, I did not see one XTerra that was below $24,000.  Every option adds to the cost of this SUV and the Nissan corporation loves to add options to these SUVs.

<b>Safety</b>
     The XTerra comes with basic safety features.  These features include dual airbags, anti-lock brakes, and remote keyless entry.  As you can see, these features are nothing to &quot;write home about.&quot;

Overall, I personally was disappointed with my testdrive of the new XTerra.  It seems as though Nissan put more thought into where to put the first aid box, then to designing a decent engine.  This SUV is obviously aimed at younger buyers who are more into looks then performance. <br><br>
