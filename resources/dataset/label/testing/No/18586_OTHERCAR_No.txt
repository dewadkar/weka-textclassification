            I bought the FUJIFILM A201 camera just before a trip to capture some relatives on camera....


Well...what a mistake !!!

Ok, about the camera.

The good part about it.

Its weigh....it's very light and small and will fit perfectly just about anywhere.

The fonctions on the camera are easy to set-up, 
the flash is powerfull
the digital zoom is okay
I love the fact you can record small movies....and that's about it !!!



The bad sides....


Unless i've been drunk all the time, this camera has  NO STABILITY whatsoever !!!

THERE are many quality settings....

THe VGA mode is more than enough for most pictures...then the 1m resolution has two modes, fine and normal and the 2M has 3 resolutions, basic, normal and fine.


in 1M mode....stability is a BIG ISSUE !!!

unless you  use a tripod, the pics will come out very blury !!!

The battery life ....they die very quickly.
on the first day I used it to try it out....the batteries ran out after about 5 hours.

The camera came WITHOUT any carry bag.

The screen display....very dark, although you can adjust its brightness...using it will shorten the battery life and you won't see anything anyways.
it's small and blury as well....unless as I said before....i'am still drunk.???!!!


(by the way...I barely drink ;)

Also, it takes too long to load the flash (and you'd better use it....even outside)

and it takes too long to react. using the automatic settings will let the diaphragm open too long which causes the blur.


As a WEBCAM...


I love the fact that you can use it as a webcam....installed very easily with the software included.....BUT....

It was too dark to see anything.

I had my webcam Logitech Messenger USB and the fuji A201 both plugged in on a different USB port...and was switching between them during a videoconference on netmeeting...no comparaison.
the fuji is simply TOO DARK !!!

well....I think that I have said enough...

ho non, I forgot about the cards.

It uses SMARTMEDIA Cards, they're ok, but they're going to disappear soon...just forget it.

Once home, i'll go back to the store, get my money refunded....or try another one.

too bad for the wasted and lost pictures...hope my cousin will get married another time ;)))
