            I bought this product to do some simple abstract photographs, and I was prepared to do some image editing on my computer, using Adobe Photoshop.

Well, the camera was quite inexpensive, and I guess I got what I paid for. Pictures are of fairly low quality and are really only suitable for the convenience of having images in the jpg format for use on the internet. Things such as family photos, especially shots of scenery have low resolution. Really, the photos only looked good with 50% zoom - when reduced in size. This camera can only take good pictures in virtually perfect lighting.

I strongly do not recommend purchasing this camera. Technology is rapidly improving, and higher megapixels are definetly needed. I have been hearing that improvements with the CMOS chip are being made...a chip rarely used which is quite inexpensive to make...as the CCD chip is expensive.

If higher price is a problem you are considering, wait a bit longer.<br><br>
