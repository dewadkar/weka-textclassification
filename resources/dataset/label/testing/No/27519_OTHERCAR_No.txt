            I purchased a 4x4 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee back in 1997.  It seemed to drive fairly well at the beginning.  A few months later, however, it seemed to sway every time I turned a corner.  I took it in, and sure enough, my sway bar was broken.  $200 and 3 months later, it broke again!  Seems like a cheap setup to me.  I also noticed there was a lot of rusting around the gas cap and lower body of the Jeep.  A 1 year old vehicle should NOT have that much rust in my opinion.  

From day 1, whenever I would drive up an incline (did not have to be very steep), it would hesitate severely.  I brought it in to Jeep and they said 'oh you need new spark plugs and wires and transmission fluid'.  They wanted $400 So I changed all that out myself and saved $350.  Guess what?  Still hesitates going up hills!

The 4x4 doesn't seem to have very good traction in the snow.  Not nearly as good as my 4x4 Ford F-250.  The jeep slid everywhere in the snow.  I didn't feel safe driving it for that reason.

In my opinion, the Jeep Grand Cherokee is poorly made, poorly constructed, and not worth the money.   <br><br>
