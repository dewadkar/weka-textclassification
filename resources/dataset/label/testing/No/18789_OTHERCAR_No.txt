            I bought my car in May of 1997 and it currently has less than 55,000 miles. I thought this was a great deal because I was in college and didn't have a lot of money.  After buying the car, I started to notice problems with the brakes.  Went through brake pads like crazy.  Find out a year or so later that my rotors were warped the whole time.  Thought that was the end of it....not so.  

In the last 6 months I have spent nearly $2000 on repairs.  First oxygen sensors, then distributor and all the accessories for it.  It also shakes when driving over 45mph and idles roughly, not to mention all the other little noises. Currently I am still dealing with the ever present "check engine" light.  I take it to mechanics and they reset something.  And a month or two later it's back on.  Now I have a new problem.  A warning light for the brakes is on.  When will it ever end??  Oh, did I mention I had to have the top of the dash replaced?  Apparently it didn't like sunlight or something because it was pulling out of whatever it's stuck into.     

So to summarize, expect problems with your breaks, your engine and attached parts, some rough driving, the loss of all your hard earned money, trouble getting parts (they are expensive), and lots of anger and headaches.

If you are short on cash or going to college, do not buy these cars!!!!!  Actually this applies to anyone.Learn from my mistake. Do not be fooled by the price.
