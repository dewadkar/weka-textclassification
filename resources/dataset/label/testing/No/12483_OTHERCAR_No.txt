            I  have owned a 2000 S40 for over a year now so I feel qualified to review the vehicle.  First, I traded a 95 Acura Integra LS 5 Speed, which was a reliable car.  That car became too small for my wife's & my needs.  Enter the Volvo.  We were after a smallish sedan, it is that.  Three days out of the show room we were rear ended by a Ford Explorer.  The other Ford suffered extensive damage.  I had a scratch on the rear bumper.  It is a safe car.  The downside...reliability.  I've had the car back to the dealer 5 or 6 times for minor service issues.  The dominant one is the silly "check engine" light.  Although I'm treated like royalty, I shouldn't be at the dealer except  for routine service.  It is not a driver's car.  If you want that, this is not your car.  The AC does not cool the car.  We drove to Las Vegas & the AC was shooting out warm air.  I hope it's fixable.  The headlights burned out already--perhaps because they're on all the time-running light feature.  Fixed for free at the dealer.  Also, service is rougly twice what a comparable Honda Acura Toyato product would be.  Engine is noisy, but responsive for a 4 cylinder.  Excellent brakes.  Interior w/leather still looks cheap.  I think a maxed out VW Jetta offers more bang for the buck.  Thanks.
