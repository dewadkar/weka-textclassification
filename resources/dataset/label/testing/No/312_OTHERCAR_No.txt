            I was one of the very first people to buy this car, in November of 1999.  My experience with this car (having just traded it this week) ranks LAST in my automotive experiences (and I've owned about 20 cars in my 47 years).

This was the first "vanity" purchase I ever made.  I bought the thing cuz I liked the way it looked - and that was all.  I thought the engine (6 cyl) was anemic, and the appearance of the engine in the engine compartment reminded me of a cadillac in the '70s - tubes, hoses, all crammed together - a nightmare.  Fortunately, I had no engine troubles with the car during it's tenure (but then, only put 30K on the thing).

What I hated so much about this car:  it's high profile created hazardous driving in high winds (a definite need for both hands on the wheel when crossing the SF Bay Bridge).  

They give you all kinds of places to tie down bungie cords - but nowhere to stash the cords themselves.  NO STOWAGE ANYWHERE!  What were they thinking?

No light in the glovebox
No coin holder of any sort.
The console wasn't sized properly for CD cases -so they rattled.
The rear seat belts rattled against the body.
Terrible mileage (15 MPG - making this the worst -mileage vehicle I've owned).
Defective Tires - when I rotated them, the front end wobbled.  They were balanced fine - so it was a defect - and neither nissan nor the tire manufacturer were willing to replace.  I subsequently put the tires back on the vehicle as it was delivered, and was never able to rotate them.

Try putting the back seat down to lay the cargo area flat.  They give you nowhere to put the lower seat cushions.  Utterly lame.

The steel-encased cargo cover has nowhere to go when you lay the seats flat - I guess you're supposed to stash it in the same place as the tire cushions?  The way Mitsubishi handled this on the Outlander was clever, and functional.  I was always uncomfortable having this big steel bar flopping around unsecured in the passenger compartment.  In an accident, it would be very, very dangerous.

The cheap plastic clips they used to secure the cheap non-woven "carpet" in the back broke, fell off, and were otherwise lost during very light duty.  Replacements (installed during the warranty) fell off even quicker.  The cargo area started looking very ratty very quickly.

Stereo was at best adequate - and I had the "deluxe" model.

The license plate lights on the back of the vehicle came off during routine car washes - when I discovered this I went back to the car wash, and found a box FULL of them - all from xTerras.  It got to the point where I'd remove them prior to getting the car washed.

The screw-off antennae got loose after having to be removed every time I got the car washed.

Skid plate was difficult to remove - which raised the price of an oil change on average $10.

Seats were uncomfortable - no lumbar support.

Only used the 4WD once, and due to the high profile of the vehicle, I was still all over the road (on packed snow in the  Sierra).

Here's the kicker, though,  kids:  I just traded the thing this week (on a Mitusbishi Outlander, which so far I LOVE).  I put $7K down on a $32K price, and paid $425/month for 3 years on a 7 year note with 6% interest, and only put 30,000 miles on the car.  Y'know what kind of equity I had in the rig when I traded it?  ZERO.  Nada.  ZIP. (Kelly Blue Book - confirmed by my trading dealer).  

 I've never seen a car depreciate so badly in my life.  Having owned 8 Nissans in the past, I doubt I'll go back to them after this.

Plus, one final point:  the ONLY thing I ever thought the xTerra had going for it was it's look - and the lame-brains at Nissan recently changed the front end to include round headlights - thus ruining the rugged look of the rig.
