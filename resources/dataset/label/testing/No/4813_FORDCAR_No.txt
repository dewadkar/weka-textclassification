   My Family purchased this car after our 1988 Ford Taurus Station Wagon went out. We thought, well, since that was a good car, why don't we try this one? Our mechanic sold it to us. He had used it 5 months. Since that time, a muffler has come out, the transmission has gone out, the door quit working, the windows quit, and other technicalities. Our family has big, tall people. This car is not designed for Big, Tall people. It is for Little people (4.8'-5.5'?). We are getting rid of it. DO NOT GET THIS CAR. WE HAVE SPENT LOTS OF MONEY ON REPAIRS AND YOU WILL TOO.<br><br>
