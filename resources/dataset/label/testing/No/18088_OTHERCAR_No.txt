            My daughter bought a '96 Neon two years ago.  She saved like crazy and bought it for her 16th birthday.  Everything was well for quite some time.  She kept up on maintenance, oil changes and what-not.  She had to replace the rear struts and now the front.  Her head gasket blew oil all over her friend's new driveway.  Her transmission needed flushed twice to get all the gunk out.  She started looking for a new car a few weeks ago because this car has given her one problem after another.  A few days ago, her "Service Engine Soon" light came on.  She took it to the mechanic.  He said her third cylinder was misfiring and she needed new spark plugs.  He also said she had a 'minor' leak in her radiator, but it should last her a few months until she could get the money together to buy a new one.  Well, four days later, she's driving to school and her heat stops working and the car over heats.  The radiator is done now also.  I don't know about buying a newer Neon, but I recommend that you don't purchase one with over 60K miles on it.  They seem to fall apart faster than they can be fixed.
