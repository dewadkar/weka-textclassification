            I purchased my KIA sportage in 1997 after I was off work for a back injury. I needed a less expensive vehicle and the sportage fit the bill. I wanted a vehicle that had room and was high off the ground. I was trading in a van and did not want to lose the space that I need for travelling. After the purchase I had a few problems. I detected a gas smell. Took it in and was told nothing was wrong. At 2000 miles, I was on vacation and the power steering hose ruptured. KIA road side assistance was wonderful. My KIA was towed ( at no cost ) to a local dealer to be repaired. Although the deal Detected a sound in the AC. Took it in was told there were leaves in my blower. They blew out the leaves for free, but not without putting up a fuss. Then, near the 30,000 mile mark, I started having a hard time starting the Kia, mainly in cold weather. It would not even turn over at times. The first two times I took the vehicle to the dealership for this problem, it would always start for them. Finally, one day while I was getting ready to go to lunch, it wouldn't start, even with trying to jump it off from another car battery. I had it towed back to the dealership, where this time it wouldn't start for them, either. The starter went out, due to an improperly attached flywheel. I ended up paying $200.00 for a new clutch plate, while all other parts and labor was covered under warranty, even though the Kia had just passed the 36,000 mile mark. Since we just had the vehicle in the shop one week earlier with the mileage just under 36,000, the dealership agreed to cover it under warranty. Ever since the repairs were done, I have had no more problems with it. A total of five or six trips to the dealership within 36,000 miles was a bit much for me, especially after driving Hondas for several years. As soon as the Kia is paid off, it will be sold, and I will go back to a minivan, either the Honda or Nissan minivan. About two years or so to go on car payments, and I will be rid the the Kia Sportage. If you want to have a small S.U.V., pay a little extra and get a Honda CRV or Toyota RAV-4. At least those S.U.V.'s are rock-solid reliable. <br><br>
