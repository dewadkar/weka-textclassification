            I bought a 1996 dodge Intrepid in October, 1999.  It had 70,000 miles which is a lot, but after 6 months of owning it, i have actually had the car up and running for about 4 weeks.  The motor blew up and along with the motor went the computer, EGR, timing ETC....  I bought it because i heard it was really reliable and because it was very nice looking and roomy, but it was the worst mistake i ever made.  By the way it is march and I haven't had the car since December because the dealers can't even figure out what's wrong.  I have put almost $15,000 into that car and I will never buy another dodge again.  I'll stick with Chevrolet.

Well  time passed on and in October 2000, I finally got the car running after having 3 new catalytic converters put on (the car is 4 years old why should it need new catalytic converters no one knows but...).  After another $3,000 dent in my pocket, I sold the car!!!  The day that I sold it, the guy had it for an hour and the check engine light came on.  I felt really bad, but it wasn't my problem anymore thank god.  I lost close to $10,000 with that car and theres not a thing I can do about it except warn others, don't buy an intrepid!!!<br><br>
