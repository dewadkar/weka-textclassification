            In 1997 I bought a program 1996 Pontiac Grand Am.  I will never purchase one again.  I had nothing but trouble out of this car.  Everything electrical went hay wire.  Windows would get stuck up, down, or usually somewhere in the middle.  Not one but two fuel injectors messed up at the same time. The radio sometimes worked and sometimes it didn't.  Something happened in the steering column that made it impossible to remove the key.  For six months I had to unhook the battery wire when I went to the store.  With 30,000 miles on it the car started using oil.  I was finally able to get rid of the car at a terrible loss.  If you don't want to be left on the side of the road I would seriously ask others about their experiences with a Grand Am.  Please remember that I purchased this car because it came highly recommended to me.<br><br>
