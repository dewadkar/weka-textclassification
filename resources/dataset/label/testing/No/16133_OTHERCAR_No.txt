            I purchased a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo in May of 2002.  About a month after I got it, we took it on a trip to Virginia from Pennsylvania.  During the trip we noticed clunking when upshifting from first and also when "stepping on the gas" to get past someone at a high rate of speed.  Upon return from the trip I spoke with the Jeep dealership that I purchased it from and they stated that this "clunking" was normal.  After another few months of this annoyance, I took it to another dealership who said some items needed replacing and adjusting.  I got it back 2 days later and driving down the road, it clunked again.  I took it bad a month later and again they said it needed more adjusting and another part.  A day later, more clunking shifting mostly from first to second.  This is driving me nuts.   I have had it in about four times and three of the four times, they "fixed" it and the last time they said they couldn't find anything wrong.  I also now have "surging" when I'm sitting at a stop (like a light or stop sign) and I will have my foot on the brake and the vehicle "surges" forward a few inches and again, the dealership said they couldn't find anything wrong.  My regular warranty is up in July (2003) and I still have the problems and no resolve.  If I could afford another vehicle, I would buy one.

It also sucks gas.  I also hate having to put it in 4-full time, but if I don't and it rains, I skid all over the place.

On the plus size, it is very roomy and the seats are comfortable for plus sized people.  It steers well too.

All in all, if I had to do it again, I wouldn't have purchased the vehicle.  Sorry!
