            This was my first new vehicle and what a nightmare it has been so far.After having my Kia Sephia for a week,I took it out on the highway when I heard this horrible thumping.I quickly pulled over to find that the stripping around the windshield had come undone and was whacking the roof of my car.Needless to say my windshield cracked about a foot and a half long horizontally,and of course is not covered under warranty.The next thing that is really bothering me is that it is really hard to get my car into first gear third gear and the car really hates reverse.I bought the car cause it was nice looking roomier than the car I had and most of all cheap.Although I love having a brand new car I dread everyday wondering what is going to happen next.The salesman was very friendly.I did buy the car over the internet and went to the Cape to pick it up.If nothing else happens I'll be happy.Gas mileage is wonderful especially in the time of the great gas crisis.Overall I would not recommend this car to a friend only because you get what you pay for.
