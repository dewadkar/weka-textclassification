            Late in 1990, I was looking for a new pickup. Having gotten fed up with my troublesome 280ZX, I traded it in (yes, foolish me!) on a new 1991 Mighty Max pickup. At the time, it seemed like a great deal. Looking back, I should have kept the sports car.

A mere 15 grand was all that was required to drive it off the parking lot. A loan was secured, and I was a proud new owner. Initially, everything was great - the dealership in South Carolina that I bought it from was friendly and helpful. They even had a &quot;New Owner&quot; night at the dealership where they detailed things like proper maintenance and care, as well as emergency roadside repairs (tire changing, etc.). At he time, this was highly unusual. From what I understand, lots of dealerships sponsor this now. So, getting out of the gate went very well.

Skip now 70,000 miles down the road. The transmission (5 speed manual) starts making a grinding noise. I am told by no less than the 5 State Regional Maintenance Supervisor that its normal because its a heavy-duty transmission due to being connected to a 3.0 liter, V-6 engine. To make a long story short, I fight with a Connecticut Mitsubishi Service Center for just over a year, paying out over $1600 as well as losing working days because of this event, before the transmission is finally replaced. Afterward, guess what? No more problem.

Skip now to 90,000 miles. The engine up and dies for no known reason, and will not restart. The culprit? The engine computer. Now I get to make a choice. Would I like to pay $1500 for a new computer (almost more than the truck is worth at this point), or rebuild the current one for $750? No brainer, right? So now it's out of commission for a week, during which I have to rely on friends and neighbors for rides to and from work.

So - If you were looking for a new truck in 1990-1991 timeframe, and were planning on getting rid of it before 70K miles, this would have been a good purchase. Unfortunately, this truck does not wear its age well, even with careful maintenance. For those of you that own this and haven't hit 90K yet - watch out. From the Mitsubishi parts center, a lot of the engine computers are going bad at this point. Looks like you'll get to make a choice too. <br><br>
