            Mid-sized sedans that come with manual transmissions and are fun to drive and unfortunately few in number. The Legacy GT 2.5 was one of a handful of cars that fit my needs.

What won me over was my test drive in the rain. Thanks to the all-wheel drive, I absolutely could not break traction in a driving storm unless I really tried. Four years down the road, it remains one of the most sure-footed sedans I've ever driven. It's completely predictable and sticks to the road as if it's been glued down to it.

It has a tendency to understeer (plow), but a touch of gas will settle the car in a corner without snapping the rear around, as can happen with some rear-wheel drive cars.

Also nice is the pleasant and comfortable interior. There's plenty of space for kids or grown-ups. The cup holders block the heating/AC controls somewhat and the radio. But there are plenty of places to store stuff. The glove compartment is a healthy size in this age of airbag-reduced glove boxes. Gauges and controls all are clear and conveniently located.

Seats are OK. They're generally comfortable, but the lumbar control is too over-aggressive for my tastes. It's either like a log in the small of my back or just not there. Trunk space is adequate, and the rear seats fold down.

Less nice was a series of blown crankshaft seals shortly before 50,000 miles. These failures emptied my engine of oil and have shaken my faith in the car's reliability, even though nothing has gone wrong in the 12,000 miles since then.

More power would be nice, too, although it's certainly adequate. I'm not a horsepower junkie (I'm a handling junkie), but below 55 mph you really need to drop down to fourth or third gear if you need to pass in a hurry. On the other hand, the engine's low-speed torque is substantial. If you don't need to accelerate in a rush, the engine pulls from as low as 1500 RPM without lugging.

It's a great car for places where there's lots of snow or rain, and it has the added benefit of not looking as childish as those ridiculous Outback models.<br><br>
