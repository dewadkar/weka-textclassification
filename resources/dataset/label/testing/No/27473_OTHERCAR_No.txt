            Nearly two years ago I bought a 1993 Sable LS as it offered a decent amount of interior room for our family of five.  It rode quietly, smoothly, and it had only 77K miles.  For a price of $5500, it appeared to be a bargain.  The seller told me that hardly anyone had called about the car, and in hindsight this should have been a tip-off that something was wrong with these cars.  All went well for about 18 months of driving the car until one day a trouble light flickered on the dashboard.  I thought it would be no big deal, maybe just it was low on brake fluid.  Being the cautious person I am, I took the car to my mechanic who hooked it up to a diagnostic computer.  To make a long story short, the car needed an engine overhaul due to a head gasket that Ford manufactured and continued to use on later models [until 1995, I believe].  Ford knew for years that this was a problem, yet did nothing about it!  They also used an aluminum piston in the transmission that caused early failures.  My mechanic said it was unusual to get 100k out of that transmission, as many of his customers were on their second or third tranny at 100k.  Being as the Sable had 93k when the engine was repaired, I decided to cut my losses and sell it.  Then came the not so great surprise: nobody called about buying the car!  Even $500 below low book, there were no takers and I finally traded it in for a 1997 Camry LE.  When I mentioned how tough it was to sell the car, several salespeople stated that the Sable and Taurus have extremely poor resale due to being very unreliable.  Never again will a Ford product be parked in my garage!<br><br>
