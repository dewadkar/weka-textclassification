            I bought this camera as my first digital camera and only expected to use it until I could make up my mind about a more expensive brand. Upon reflection, I should simply have shelled out the money for a Sony. I have had nothing but problems with this product, most of which has been with the included software. It is the slowest, most incomprehensible software I have ever had the misfortune of working with. The camera will only download to this software and after only 1 1/2 months of use it will not even do that anymore. After an attempt to read up on the warranty information at their web site I discovered that they take no responsibility in their faulty software and even admit that they may or may not know that it is faulty!
Because of terrible picture quality, awful software, slow download time (if at all) and horrible customer service/warranty I really must recommend that anyone looking into digital cameras look elsewhere. You may spend more money, but it will count for more.
