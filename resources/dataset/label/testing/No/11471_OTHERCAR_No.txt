            a small ugly car without any of the benefits of a small ugly car. I got this car in 2000 so it already had about 50,000 miles on it. Before I hit 70,000 mi I  replaced the alternator and the transmission. My parents decided to take the car to the Saturn dealership which ended up costing us about $1000 dollars more than anywhere else for the transmission fix. Right now, at 80,000 mi, I need a new steering column and another new transmission which stopped going in reverse one month after the warranty on the last trans fix was up so I was pretty much out of luck as far as the dealership was concerned. The window on the driver's side leaks every time it rains. It has the worst turning radius of any car I've ever driven -which is very difficult to deal with when the thing won't go in reverse. Even if I did not have to deal with these repairs, it is loud, the engine is whinny and things rattle. The gas mileage is great, and my parents have a Saturn that has had no problems at all and is up to 150,000 mi, but I also have heard from a number of people who have had the same problems I have had with Saturn. So as far as I can tell this car is really hit or miss - and I really missed. I am hoping to sell it now but I can't find anyone to buy it for more than $400 dollars. I wish I could just throw it away.
