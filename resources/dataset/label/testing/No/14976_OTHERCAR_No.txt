            We have an FD-73 at work and we use it primarily for taking pictures of computer parts when customers want to see what a part looks like. After taking the pictures we usually e-mail them.

For that purpose the camera works fine, the close-up pictures look good, but only when lighting conditions are good. I usually take the part and the camera outside, because the colors tend to be off under fluorescent lights.

It's when I got to take the camera with me on vacation that I saw the real quality of the pictures, which isn't good. The colors don't match the 'real-world' colors, and they have a 'tv-like' appearance. In low-light conditions the picture quality deteriorates even further to the point of being unacceptable.

One of it's key features is of course its floppy drive. This works really well. No hassle with cables and drivers. Just pop out the floppy, insert it in ANY pc and you can see or mail the pictures instantly. Usually I get 20 to 30 images on one floppy, depending on light conditions and image complexity.

The flash is way to bright on short distances (even on the low setting) and sometimes not bright enough on longer distances (even on high setting). There's quite a narrow area in which the flash is just right.

Operation is a breeze, I have been experimenting with the various programmes but on auto the pictures usually come out best (best for this camera). Autofocus is fast and accurate.

The zoom is great! Most digicams on the market today have a lousy 3x or 5x optical zoom plus some digital zoom (which is almost totally useless in my opinion). The FD73 has a whopping 10x OPTICAL zoom, which is fast and easy to operate. It's a bit difficult to hold the camera steady at such high zoom numbers, but that's not the camera's fault. A tripod can be used.

The battery is good enough for everyday use. I can shoot for a solid hour most of the times, and when I shut the camera off when not used for a few minutes that time is extended even more. A battery with larger capacity can be bought.

The casing is sturdy enough for everyday use and the camera has a good grip.

In short: it would have been a fine camera, except for one crucial point: the quality of the pictures.

I have ordered a MVC-FD88, so I expect to write a review of that camera in a few weeks.<br><br>
