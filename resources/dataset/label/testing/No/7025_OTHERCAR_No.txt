            The 2002 Subaru Outback Sport has a lot going for it... AWD, strong styling, great acceleration for it�s class and responsive handling.  Sounds great, doesn�t it?  Not exactly.

Once you are inside the Outback Sport and can no longer admire the body styling and 15-inch alloy wheels, your attention will turn to creature comforts and you will notice a few serious shortcomings.

The front cloth seats are very cheap, with flimsy construction and unforgiving cushioning.  Even with the height adjustment, I found the driver's seat extremely uncomfortable on trips longer than 30 minutes.  I'm told that seats in the Impreza WRX are much better, and I certainly hope they are.  These are awful.

The rear seat is okay, however passengers will feel quite cramped due to the narrow roof line of the Outback Sport.  Taller adults will find their ears within inches of the passenger handles above the doors.  The leg room in the rear is typical for this size of vehicle... tight.

Interior space overall is below average.  Most noticeable for the driver is a fairly small foot space because of the intrusion of the powertrain.  If you have driven nothing but FWD vehicles like me, you will immediately notice this.

The stock stereo is absolutely horrible.  It�s weak, sounds bad and features microscopic buttons that are virtually impossible to use without taking your eyes off of the road.  I�m not a car stereo fanatic and have never had extra amps or subwoofers in any vehicle, but the Outback Sport sounds so bad that it seems designed for AM radio exclusively.  Now if you do what I did and replace it with an after-market stereo, you will be further disappointed.  Poor speaker housings (only 4" holes in the rear doors) make the Outback Sport acoustically inept.  It�s a lost cause.

Overall, the ergonomics are fine.  The gauges are well placed and easy to read, and climate controls are intuitive.  The wiper control can be a bit much for some with an intermittent dial, front and rear wiper control all jammed on a single steering column arm.  The ventilation system is adequate, although the fan seemed a little weak on maximum.  

And then there is that tray-style drink holder in the dash that everyone mentions.  It�s pathetic and impractical, period, which leaves you with a single functional drink holder in the entire vehicle.  This seems like a petty issue, but is something that will irritate your passengers every time you go on a trip.

Overall, the build quality of the interior is poor. Controls and buttons feel very cheap and a few rattles and creaks showed up within the first week of ownership.  I would expect this from a less expensive car, but not for the price tag of the Outback.


The Outback Sport will continue to attract buyers because of it's aggressive styling and performance, but these qualities come at a price.  From the inside, the Outback feels and sounds like a cheap car with a great powertrain.
