            I enjoy the style of this car and its sleek design.  One of the best features of this car is that it is a mustang and a mustang is a reliable car which can be trusted to last a long time.  My friend has a Mustang Coba and he got a special paint job done that makes it three different colors when looked at through different angles.  The ride is very smooth and the power is fenominal. The front is a great feature wich makes this car stand out som much and this car will make your heads turn.  the power of this car can really be felt right when you turn the car on and you feel the reve of the engine and the feeling of power under the hood.  if your looking for a great car at a great price, then put the Mustang Convetable Cobra on your test drive list!!! <br><br>
