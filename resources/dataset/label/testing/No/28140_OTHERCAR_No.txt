            I'm in the market for ANOTHER digital camera, and borrowed the Polaroid PDC-700 from a co-worker. The first thing that caught my attention was how confusing it was to change between hi and low resolution. The modes are XGA and VGA. I tried to relate it to the type of monitor from days of past, but THAT doesn't really help, so, I just use the old handy dandy picture counter. The one that gives me LESS number of shots left is the low resolution mode.

As for battery life...let's just say "What battery life?". This camera went thru a set of Hi-Capacity rechargable Ni-Cad batteries like you would not believe. I think I actually pulled out 20 shots before the batteries needed a recharge. Oh yeah, before I forget, this camera ISN'T even a full 1.0 mega-pixel camera (says so right on the camera).

Half.Com has this camera for $139. Not a bad price, but, I was still a bit disappointed being that normally, Polaroid usually defines the meaning of taking quality pictures. Well, that's my 2 cents worth. I'm Audi.
