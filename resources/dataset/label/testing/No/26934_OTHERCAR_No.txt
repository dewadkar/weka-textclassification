            We all know about the Toyota Camry, "The Best Selling Mid-size Sedan in the U.S."...Even though I was turned off by its unpleasant exterior design, I said I'd give it a shot test driving it for our next family car. We previously also tested sleek 1998 Honda Accord V-6 as well with full option for about 18,500 US dollars. The Camry we tested was NOT fully optioned, though it had leather seats, cassette player, AC, Power windows, V-6 engine...NO power seats, NO CD player and the leather's condition wasn't at its best either. 
            <b>Exterior<b>
    Very bland, I don't think the Camrys are ugly, however it certainly is NOT a stylish sedan. The 2000~2001 with chrome grills and larger headlights and rear lights does make the Camrys look better but 1998's bland grill and rear lights makes the Camry look way too cheap for its actual price. 
            <b>Interior<b>
    This is where I was most disappointed. 1998 Honda Accord had very modern and expensive looking ergonomics, but the Camrys were the opposite... The ergonomics looked too cheap and boring. It looked like there was a big hole and someone just stuck cassette player in it. Where in Honda Accord or Mercury Sable, the ergonomics are very well laid out and stylishly assembled. 
            <b>Ride Quality<b>
    Though it was satisfying, I was not impressed. I actually thought the (1996~current)Mercury Sables had smoother ride with less noise. When I was riding on the highway (60mph), you could clearly hear the excessive wind noise, feeling like I had the windows opened a little bit. The seats were not comfortable after 10 minutes of ride, however the engine felt peppy. 
            <b>Fit and Finish<b>
    This particular Camry had some problems with the leather, the front seats' threads were wearing off and the leather on the neck supporter was almost peeling off. The car was just way too simple. I could not determine the quality as much as I would have liked since it was just a test drive. 
            <B>Roominess<b>
    The Camrys look larger than it actually is. Mercury Sable is roomier than the Camry with larger trunk. Back seat of the Camry was unimpressive, I doubted if 2 big adults would feel comfortable in the back seats. The trunk space was large enough. 

    Overally... I dare say...Toyota Camrys are overrated. Unpleasant design inside and out...Tight space in the back seat...Boring ergonomics with poor leather quality...I'm not saying that the Camrys are bad cars at all, however you might want to spend extra 1500~2000 dollars for <b>fully</b> equipped handsome and just as reliable Honda Accord V-6 or even save 2000~3000 dollars by getting 1998~1999 larger, roomier Mercury Sable LS.
