            Back in 1995 I heard that Dodge will be remodeling the Caravan, which I was interested to buy.  In 1997 I bought the Caravan for $20650.  I thought that Chysler would have fixed all the bugs it had to the new model, but I was wrong.  On the first week of driving the van the engine failed and took 2 months to fix the problem.  Next came the crazy windsheild wipers.  The windsheild for some reason turn on itself without me ever turning it on.  The dealer replace the timing with a fixed timing.  Then the radio broke and had to replace.  After that the air condition got infected with bacteria, which made the air smell really bad.  The next thing that had a problem was the steering wheel it was clicking when I turn and was fixed.

The only thing that I ever like this van is the price and comfort of it.  It offer quite a lot.  But the rolling seats are a headache, it's too heavy and needs two person to be able to get it out.

Driving it is very easy with it's foward cab design.
The van is okay but if you are willing to risk the problems go ahead and buy one for yourself, but I won't ever again.
