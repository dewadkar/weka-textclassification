            Not a bad deal, $99.95 for this camera, will give it a try, but asked first if I could return it if not happy.  I wasn't happy.  Put in two brand new alkaline batteries that I checked first and they were dead in a matter of minutes.  I charged up a couple of 1800 mah metal hydrides and they lasted about 30 minutes.  Oh well, will just charge up a pocket full of batteries and go picture taking.

But the picture taking ability of this camera really turned me off in a big hurry, you have to view the LCD to use the zoom feature and if you frame a shot in the view finder without have the digital set to 1X, you just wasted a shot.

While this camera does have a fixed macro lens setting, you have to move the camera in and out judging on the low res LCD whether you are in focus or not.  Not at all good for taking ebay shots of small objects.  This camera lacks the all important auto focusing adjustments, just a cheap fixed lens camera.  Useless for portrait shots.

Furthermore, the auto exposure only goes down to F4.6, taking any indoor camera with the flash results in very grainy shots, colors are poor and practically any shot is out of focus.

The camera is loaded with software based gadgetry, well software is cheap, a good lens and lower light capability that is required for taking a reasonably good picture is totally lacking in this camera.  I would rate it as a piece of junk.  If the sun is just right, would be okay for some landscape shots.  What this camera really lacks is a memory card global reset feature as you will want to start all over again after see you what you took.

For $158.00, would look at the Cannon A10 camera with true auto focusing, an F2.0 lens, and an optical 3X zoom lens.  It has 35 mm equivalent SLR type wide angle lens capability that you need for any indoor shots unless you use a chain saw to cut a hole in a wall.  It also has digital zoom, but that is more of a toy than good picture taking capability.

Was a Sony fan for years, but recently, getting unhappy with some of the garbage they have been passing off lately.  I did get my $99.95 back, I wouldn't have given 5 bucks for this camera.  If it can't take good pictures, it's useless.

I do like my Sony DSC-D770 camera that works great with an external Vivitar 285 flash attachment, but a little much to haul around at an amusement park with my grandkids.  A camera has to have some kind of lens, and not a pinhole like the DSC-P20, would save your money and look at something else.
