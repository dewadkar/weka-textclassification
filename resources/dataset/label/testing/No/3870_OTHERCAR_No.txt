                 My husband and I always said that we would never buy a van.  After our third child we reconsidered.  We decided that we needed something larger than our car.  After shopping around, we purchased a 1999 Plymouth Voyager.  The price simply could not be beat.  We paid $14,500 for it brand new, although after adding a warranty,  sales tax and Washington State registration (ugh!) we owed roughly $19,000.  We have now had this van for one year, and my main concern is the depreciation.  There is no way that we would be able to sell it or trade it in when they are selling the 2000's for less than $14,000.  If you are looking to buy a Plymouth Voyager, I would definitely recommend  a Grand Voyager instead.  They are much more spacious, and seem to hold their value a bit more.     I would also recommend purchasing a van with more options, as the model that we bought has next to none.  Tinted windows would be great. <br>     As far as reliability, I have never actually been stranded anywhere, but it has been in the shop three times.  This seems like a lot to me for a brand new car.  In fact, it is in the shop now because it is leaking some sort of fluid and has a problem with the steering.<br>     It is easy to drive, and I never thought that  I would be able to drive something this large.  There are so many windows that it does not really have any blind spots. <br>     The back seats are very easy to take out, but they are not very comfortable.  The kids ride in the back without complaining, but there is not much room for adults. <br><br><br>
