            What a junker! We bought ours brand new back in late '96. Fully loaded, 4WD, black w/ gray cloth interior. If I could only turn back time. Let's see...were do I start?

Check Engine Light:
The CIL first reared its ugly little head about one month after purchase. I immediately brought it into the service department at my local dealer to have it looked at. They fed me a HUGE load of crap about not screwing the gas cap on tight enough, or not topping off the tank. Correcting these things did nothing. So I had to leave it with them for a week (and they would not even give me a loaner!) They said that it was some sort of sensor and that it is now fixed. Great, or so I thought. 2 weeks later the same thing happened. Dealer fed me the same line�another sensor. 3 months later�same thing. This time the dealer said it was something connected to the sensor. Fixed. 2 months later, the light shows up again. I did not even bother taking it in this time. I could not be without the car, and it apparently did not affect performance. The light stayed on up until we got rid of it a few months ago.

Radio:
The radio crapped out about 6 months after purchase. No lights, no sound�nothing. Took two weeks to order new unit and replace.

Radiator:
2 years after purchase, the radiator cracked and leaked all fluids. Entire unit had to be replaced.

AC:
2 years after purchase, the AC stopped blowing cold air. Two different hoses had to be replaced.

Spare Tire Cover:
The zipper broke the FIRST time I ever unzipped it, rendering it useless.

Driver and Passenger Front Power Windows:
Both front windows quit working within the SAME WEEK! You now have to use your hands and force it up or down. The car was already out of warranty at this time, so I just lived with it.

Transmission:
For the last year that I owned it, the transmission was on its last leg. When I would start from a dead stop, it would take a very long time to switch from 1st to 2nd gears. 

Battery:
If the car would sit for more than a few days, the battery would die.

Those are just some of the major issues I encountered. There are countless other things. The gas mileage is horrible! 15-17 mpg tops. The spare tire hatch is awful. You have to slam it very hard to get it to shut properly. Also, the car has absolutely no power and little pick up. I would think twice before pulling out it front of turtle, much less a busy intersection. The center caps on the wheels have all broken off. Poor design and cheap plastic. The 'Kia' and 'Sportage' badges have all disappeared. Cheap glue.
You must have Popeye forearms to shift it into 4WD.
