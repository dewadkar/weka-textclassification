            In June, 2000, I wrote a review on the new Volvo V70 wagon that we purchased.  This review, while more tempered toward a middling score than the first one, does not replace my view previously given.  Consider this an update of that review, with another year and a half of experience with the car, and with the car dealership to dampen my enthusiasm.

I need to separate out the car itself from all other aspects involved with owning a car (such as service, leasing hassles, etc).  So this review is broken into the following sections:  The Car, The Dealership/Service, My Unhappy Wife, and What To Do Now.

<b>The Car</b>
We purchased this car about a year and a half ago.  It is an SE model, with the 2.4 liter 5 cylinder engine, leather seats, cold weather package, stability traction control and CD player. Lots of extras (incl memory seat position, dual climate control, remote keyless entry ) were included in the base price as well.  We were impressed with the overall feel of comfort, safety, and road ability.  Upon driving, we found the pickup to be decent, cornering and visibility superb, quality of materials seems high, and the overall fit/finish very nice.  The price tag (about 34K) was steeper than we wanted to go, but with a lease we were able to get the monthly payments to fit our budget.

At the time of this writing, we are approaching 30K miles.  While I still enjoy driving the car, and find it to have very nice road manners, other aspects that first drew us to this vehicle have declined.  

<I>Exterior</I> - Slight bumps from grocery carts will leave a small area of the door missing the outer layer(s) of paint.  In addition, the rear bumper has been scratched down to the black plastic underneath too easily.
<I> Interior</I> - What we took to be high-quality fit/finish and materials is in fact slightly better than average.  One of the two cup holders in the front (which are useless for anything larger than a sippie-cup) has broken already, and the faux wood around the radio will scratch if you look at it wrong.  The integrated child seat in the back suffered from a strange case of lockdown, and had to be replaced.  On the flip side, the leather seats have held up well, and are still very supple.  
<I>Mechanics</I> - This is perhaps the one area where I am most disappointed in the car.  The problems we have had range from electrical faults in the dashboard systems to noisy steering.  The steering is the most critical issue, and I probably can�t fault the car completely on this.  I have to lay some of the blame on the dealership, who after 3 repeat visits still hasn�t replace a single steering component, and continues to refute that they can without solid evidence of faulty hardware in the system.  Which brings me to�

<b>The Dealership/Service</b>
The first thing to understand about a Volvo is that there aren�t that many dealerships around.  You have to usually travel twice as far to find one that most other car manufacturers.  In our area, the closest on is about 30 miles away. 
We have brought the car there for every scheduled service, and for the many repeat visits for the electrical issues in the dash and the steering problems.  Only once have I been given a loaner vehicle, and in most cases the �should only be an hour or so� turns into 3-4.  The service manager has been contentious about many aspects, including the repeat visits.  I work in a service business, and you judge the success of your handling of a customer by the number of times that they get contentious with you � the less the better.  In this case, I�ve had to employ contentiousness on an endemic level to get any reaction.  

Another thing that Volvo does is customer sat surveys post service calls.  On the last one, my wife was brutally honest about the treatment and lack of consideration we have received.  This information made it�s way back to the dealership, and we received a call by the service manager asking how we could have possible scored them so low!@!  Anyway, suffice it to say that they have been the lowest common denominator in this whole experience

<b>My Unhappy Wife</b>
Since my wife is the primary driver of this car, she sees/hears/experiences most of the trauma we have gone through.  Until this last escapade, where she stiffly refused to even deal with the dealership anymore, and that now it was wholly my nut to crack.  While she likes the car from a driving perspective, and has commented many times on how well it handles bad weather (which we get a bit of here in Mass), she would gladly trade it on for a lower priced domestic car if we could without loosing money on it.  And as we all know, a happy wife is a happy wife, and a ticked-off/steam coming out of the ears/ready to erupt wife is a demon to live with (sorry dear!).

<b>What To Do Now</b>
As part of a refinance of our house, we bought out of the lease of the car, saving us about 7G�s.  As it stands now, with typical resale values, we would loose about 5-6K of that payoff if we traded it in.  So for now, we will stick it out.  I still have high hopes for the car, if only we can get the steering in line.  Since it is ours free and clear, still has warranty up to 50K, and my car has been paid off for over a year, we have the luxury of waiting it out some more.  At some point, I would like to trade it in on a 4-door sedan for my little honey, and put these difficult times behind us.  You can be sure that when the time comes, I�ll be perusing these pages for reviews and comments on potential replacements.

I know that this may not be a typical experience for a car such as ours, that maybe we just got a slight lemon from a disingenuous lemonade stand of a dealership, so I can�t say that on the whole the Volvo V70 wagon isn�t or can�t be a good car.  I still would give ours a B-/C grade (not great, and a little disappointing for the money we paid � but not a complete clunker).
