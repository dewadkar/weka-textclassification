            I bought this vehicle for my family as well as use for my wife's business. It has plenty of room and the seats are easy enough to maneuver. I like the TV / VCP that comes with it. Its wonderful. The ride is smooth, and the seats are comfortable. The controls for the stereo in front and back could be a little easier. I would suggest this vehicle to anyone who needs a lot of room in a car and/or families with kids or people who carpool often. We took the car on a road trip down the East coast, and up. The seats were very comfortable.

Bottom Line: A convenient car that suits its purpose.
