            I investigated the '99 before finally buying a competing model in February 1999. The Rodeo is attractively styled, and has a full frame for strength and durability. It also has some good features, but it suffers from some undesirable characteristics as well.

First, I was shopping for price, and the base engine on the Rodeo is a 4 cylinder, not a six. In addition, the anti-lock brakes are not standard, and add to the base price.

The ride, I must acknowledge, was quite good. But some of that ride apparently is accomplished by very soft springing, since the Rodeo seems to have more body roll than any other SUV that I drove. This makes it very soft riding, however, so it depends on what you are looking for.

I did not care for the way the rear seats fold up- it is a two step process, requiring you to lift the bottom seat cushion from the back, fold it up against the front seats, and then fold down the rear seat back. This is not a one hand, or even one step process. In addition, when the rear seat is folded down, you can see the back of the seat cushion, making the appearance distinctly &quot;unfinished&quot;.

While this may be a good SUV, for me it was not as good a value as the Blazer I bought. Once I added a V6, anti-lock brakes, decent road wheels and the other basics like an AM/FM cassette, etc. the price of the Rodeo would have been about 24,000. The Blazer ended up below $18,000 (although it was a 2-door) WITH all the items just mentioned STANDARD. (see my review under &quot;99 Blazer- great value&quot;)<br><br>
