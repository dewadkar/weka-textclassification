            The Reason I bought the 1999 Grand Cherokee was because my wife really loved the way it looked, She fell in love with the car and I was felt it pretty comfortable when I test-drove this car for the first time. Also I note that for a 6-cylinder vehicle it had a lot of power.
 

2 month after I bought this car was my first visit to the shop, transfer case broke plus something else I don�t recall. Then my left window's motor broke, and gas meter. The first time I had to call Chrysler directly because the guys from the dealer did not know what was going on with my front end... They kept telling me it was the tires. (Yeah all right). Since I had so many problems with my jeep I decided to take a trip online to find out what people were saying about this car, I was not sure If maybe I was the only one unfortunate but I found out I was not the only one! There are 100's of complains out there, you don�t have to take my word forward, got to yahoo message boards, or even your search engine, just type &quot;1999 jeep grand Cherokee sucks&quot; and you will get a lot of cool information about this SUV.

 I always had this thing against American cars, but now I'm sure I will never buy American cars again. I also own a 1999 Honda accord and that its really a peace of work.. No problems at all, I love that car.

I'm sorry If I disappointed you guys but again don't take my word forward, search on the net before you buy a new SUV, don't waste 30k on a car that is gonna give you trouble!

********************** UPDATE, UPDATE, UPDATE*************************
My wife went to the mall, you know to do their things, she took the jeep. Guess what, she went to get some Gas and the car refused to turn on again! I had it towed to the dealer from the mall. Is this bad luck or what? By the way, My jeep is for sale if any of you want to buy it.
