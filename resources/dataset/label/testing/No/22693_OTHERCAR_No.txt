            I had originally bought the vehicle in 1994 because I had done research and seemed the best value.  The only things I didn't like in the beginning were that the windows would creep down causing wind noise, and ground clearance.  The handling was good, and after getting some Firestone tires instead of those Goodyears, it handled even better than before.

The car could handle turns better than any other car I had driven within its price range.  It handled turbulence around the tractor trailers extremely well.

I had a rotor damaged during the summer of '99 because the one side wore down quicker than the other.  I replace that.  Then October 15, 1999, the car lost power, and my check engine light went off.  The head gasket had gone, and the coolant had leaked down the exhaust valve, so there was no warning sign, and the head was cooked.  During the course of the repair, all I got was the manager saying, &quot;...if it is under warranty...&quot;  I knew it was under warranty, but I came back with the fact that I knew that Crysler knew about this problem and never issued a recall for it.  He backed down immediately.  (I have heard of an &quot;unwritten warranty&quot; on this defect.  You have to check the Neon clubs on line to find out about it.)

Then May 11, 2000 arrived.  While attempting to make a left turn off of a four lane highway, I was rear-ended by an '86 Buick which sent my car, which was at a complete stop, 25-35 feet.  The back of the seat, which is supposed to prevent whiplash, broke off knocking me around my shoulder belt and into the frame above the windshield.  The fuel cutoff switch which is supposed to activate on impact, did not activate.  I had to shut off the engine afterwards.  I went to get my tags off of it yesterday because it is a total loss.  The car started up fine so we could pull it up to get to the partially attached bumper.

Based on those two safety features that failed, I would have to say that the 1995 Plymouth Neon at least is a piece of junk.
