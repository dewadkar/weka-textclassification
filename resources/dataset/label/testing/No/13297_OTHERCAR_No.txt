            I owned the previous model Accord, with 2.2L engine (this model did not come in Australia with the 3.0 L engine it now has.) and enjoyed the excellent build quality of the vehicle, as well as it's sporty handling.  I recently purchased a new accord V6 and have been very very disappointed with the inferior quality of the interior.  The vehicle is not nearly so well made as the previous model, most noticeably the plastics in the dash, specifically the glove box, door trims, centre console, and gear shift are  markedly looser and have larger gaps between each molding.  This vehicle is clearly not as well made as the previous model, probably due to it's construction being moved from Japan to America and the lower emphasis on quality seen in American vehicles.  Whilst the engine is much more powerful, the vehicle does not feel like it could travel a winding road at the pace of the older model, but with the much larger model this should be expected to some extent.  

The vehicle is running well, and has had no expenses other than regular servicing, but the previous Accord did not have any expenses other than servicing for the entire 4 years that I owned it.

All things considered the new Accord, a fairly different type of vehicle from the old model Accord, is still a good vehicle.  But it was a major disappointment to take delivery of a car with one of the hallmarks of the Honda marque, quality, so clearly in absence.<br><br>
