If I had to think it over, would I buy this car, NO.
Why, not?  Because a car is not an investment and
I've better things to do with my money.  =)

If I get a good deal on the price, would I buy it, MAYBE.

Do I like this car?  YES.

Other car you should consider before getting this
car would be, Toyota Celica, Honda Civic Si, Audi A4

The car is very responsive.  It is fun to drive on
city and hwy.  200 hp, V6, 3.0 liter engine provide
plenty of power for me. 

The back does not really have enough room
if there are two big persons in front.  
I can hear the road noise in city and hwy, 
and I could certain feel every bump and crack on the
road.  The sound system is very nice, 4 disc CD changer,
7 speakers.

The integrated compass, temperature, and clock console
is horrible.  Really bad design, and too far for someone
like me with a short arm to change the mode for this
console.  Go see the car and you'll know what I mean.

The power seat is OK, but it has no memory, could be
better.  I am having problem with the sunroof and need
to get that fix.

This car has one recall so far.  Replacement of the
coolant hose.

Personally, I like the looks of this car,
fast and aerodynamic.  The rear also looks OK.

I've not taken this car on a long drive yet, but
I've taken it up 120 on a straight a way, 
and it is very stable.  

I like layout of the air condition/heater, very
intuitive.
The radio/CD changer buttons are large and easy to
push.

Sequential Port Fuel Injection aids in the
responsiveness of the acceleration when
you press on the gas pedal.  The acceleration
is smooth.

The car antenna is build into the glass of the
hatch back.  You can not lock the gas door.

In a small parking space, it is very difficult
to get out because of the long big door.
Rear visibility is poor.

I will tell you why I got this car.
I wanted a sport car that get at least 20 mpg on
the street.  I wanted a car that looks fast.
I wanted a car that has decent back seat.
I wanted a car with folding back seat and good
size truck space.

And remember, a car is not an investment.
-------------------------------------------

It has been six months and around 7000 miles.  
How did this Eclipse GT do?

0. There has been one recall.  The replacement
of an engine oil hose.  It took 4 months after
receiving the recall letter for
the part to arrive at the dealership.

1. My SRS (has to do with the passenger side
air bag) light came on after a suddenly
heavy stomp of my break pedal.  The
dealership said they will replace the the
complete air bag (There is a technical 
notice out on this.)

2. The moon roof does not open smoothly.
It vibrates as it slides open, instead of
just a smooth slide the way it supposed to.
The dealer solved this for now.

3. The right track of the moon roof has a 
slight dip.  I didn't notice this until now.
Also on the same right track, a tiny cube like
rubber is missing.  The one rubber on the left
side seems to be intact.  Issue opened.

4. The sunshade broke when I pull on it too hard.
The dealer said they will order the part.

All the problems seem to be minor.  No annoying
noises.  Engine performs smoothly on freeway
and street.  The eclipse GT dealer trade-in is
around $17,000.  In absolute dollar, you are
losing money either way.
