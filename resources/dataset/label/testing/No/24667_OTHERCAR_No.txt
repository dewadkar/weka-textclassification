            I am an avid GM fan and currently rented a Venture to try it out before making a purchase decision.

This van is far superior to the Lumina minivan it replaces.  It is priced competitively and full featured, unlike the Ford Windstar where everything seems to be an option.  For less than $25,000 you get four doors, power windows/locks, remote keyless entry, a nice 185 hp V6 engine and a roof rack.

The seats are easily removed, but in my opinion nothing beats the Honda Odyssey's hide-away bench, and storage capacity is fantastic - especially if you don't need the rear bench.  We literally put four suitcases, a portable crib, two strollers, a huge cooler and a weeks worth of diapers without filling up 1/2 the available space.

At highway speeds the car is very quiet and composed.  The seats are good, though thigh support is lacking.  Visibility is good in all directions and acceleration is ample.  The dual CD/Cassette stereo is very cool considering all my music is on CD and the children's are on cassettes.  

Air conditioning is powerful, but rear seat ventilation was lacking.  You will need to put the fan on full power to cool the whole van down within a reasonable time frame.

Controls are well laid out, but the lack of a tachometer is annoying.  Even with an automatic transmission it is nice to see how hard the engine is pushing.  Our rental didn't come with the power doors, but they were very easy to open and close manually.

If this van has one fatal flaw it is in the crash test results.  According the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Venture is a death trap in an accident. See their home page ( http://www.iihs.org/ ).  As one person told me &quot;I've seen egg shells perform better in an accident.&quot; 

For this one reason - SAFETY - the Venture is off our minivan list.  GM - oh so close!<br><br>
