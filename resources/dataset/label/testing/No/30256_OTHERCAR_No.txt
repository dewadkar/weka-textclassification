            My mother-in-law purchased this camera off an aol special while visiting her daughter in Texas.  She purchased the product because it was on sale.  The camera is small in size and very compact, which is nice.  The Photo Wise software that comes with the product is great and very user-friendly.  I would recommend purchasing a plug in adapter for it, because it wears new batteries down within 15 minutes of use (not very good).  We have also have a problem with getting our flash to go off.  It still hasn't.  The clarity on the pictures is also something to be desired.  But the camera is small and I was expecting that.  The camera comes with a small pouch to protect camera.  Is easy to hook up to computer and also can connect to television set to review photos if not near a computer.  The ease of connecting camera to computer and television is a plus, and user-friendly software is also a plus, but I feel that the clarity of the pictures isn't worth the buy even with the other options.
