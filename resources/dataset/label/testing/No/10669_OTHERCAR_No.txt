            I bought this car before heading off to college.  It did manage to make it through.  I kept it for 5 years and put 140,000 miles on it.  However, it left much to be desired.

I had the wagon model, which was neat.  It had much more head room in the rear seat, and the back windows were removable.  I novelty I never used much.

The manifold on my car was a big pain.  I think I had it welded 4 times over the course of 5 years.  It would just fall off the connection to the rest of the exhust.  

The car developed an interesting problem where it was easier to steer right than left.  Turns out, the rack (as in rack and pinion steering box) was leaking and the gears had worn.  I think I am the only person I have ever HEARD of who had that happen to a car.  It had to be replaced (good thing it was still under warrentee).

The transmission went out too.  I am not the type to burn out transmissions, so it was a bit unexpected.  A transmission going at 65,000 miles?! 

When I bought the car, my father told me to get the extended warentee.  Normally, I think they are useless, but it was a good investment with this car.  The transmission ($1200) and the rack ($1500) were both covered.

Izuzu is now out of the car buisness, and the geo line has merged back into Chevy.  Its a good think.  I would never buy another Izuzu car because of my little Geo Storm.
