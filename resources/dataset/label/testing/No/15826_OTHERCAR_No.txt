            The transmission on this car is very unpredictable when starting cold after sitting overnight. It often slips, and sometimes unexpectedly grabs. Be very careful!! The dealer will refuse to confirm or repair this condition. You will not notice this problem until after you've purchased the car. It is most dangerous if multiple drivers use the car. The transmission slips following a cold start, and grabs when the engine is warm. If you don't know whether the engine is hot or cold, itï¿½s very unpredictable and dangerous. Once you get underway, it seems fine all day. It's only a problem for the first 60 seconds or so. But, if you're backing out of a garage or other tight space, an unexpected slippage or acceleration can be a hazardous problem.
