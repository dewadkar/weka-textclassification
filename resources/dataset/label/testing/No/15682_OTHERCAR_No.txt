            Maybe it's because it's their (almost) entry-level car.  Maybe it's because it was the first year of a new body style.  Maybe my expectations were unrealistic.

The good: The engine is nice - it's smooth and sounds good under power.  No, it's not the most powerful thing out there, but it's strong enough and more than adequate (talking C320) for navigating through traffic.  It's also got a great highway ride, and handles well for a car on all-season tyres.  The SpeedStick 5-speed autobox is very nice, and the side-to-side shifting is very intuitive, though different that everybody elses&#146 manu-matic transmissions.  It actually does stay in the gear it&#146s told to and will run into the rev limiter rather than shift like some cars.  No, it won&#146t let you go into 1st at 75 MPH, but if it&#146s in first, it&#146ll stay there.   There are a lot (a whole lot) of features packed into the little car and it&#146s all very luxurious.  It&#146s a nice cabin to spend some time in.  There are a lot of little features designed to pamper.

It&#146s also, for a Mercedes, sporty and well handling.  A BMW 330i would leave it for dead on a twisty road, but compared to a previous generation C or the pre-2003 E-class, the 2001 C is a sports car.

The not so good:  Well, I had no confidence in the electrical system.  Basically from the day we took it home, the car was plagued by little annoyances, but when spending just shy of $40k, you expect the features to actually work, no?  The seat memory positions failed (module replaced), the mirror memory positions failed (module replaced), light bulbs blew regularly (several replaced), and I&#146d get intermittent light failures that would then work again a few days later.   I was just waiting until one of the big electrical gremlins came to light, leaving the car dead and my wallet much lighter.   Again, because it&#146s a Mercedes and not a Dodge, I had high expectations.  

Speaking of Dodge&#133.You go to an Infiniti dealer with your car, you get an Infinity loaner.  Same at Lexus.  Same at BMW.  What did I get?  A Dodge Neon.  I&#146m not disparaging the Neon, just think it a bit inappropriate.   

Also, radio reception is horrid and the Bose system, while sounding good, has almost no bass.  The instrument cluster layout is for a commuter-mobile, not anything with sporting pretensions.  Smallish trunk.

The dumb:  An optional CD changer that takes up 50% of the glove box.  Hello!?

Overall, the Mercedes experience left me disappointed and I don&#146t think I&#146ll be going back for seconds.  it was not bad, just not enough to justify the cost.
