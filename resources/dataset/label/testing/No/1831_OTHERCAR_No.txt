            I owned a 1987 Tarus. At 103,000 miles the transmission went out on it. When I purchased a used 1994 Mercury Sable, I was concerned about the transmission. The car had 58,000 miles on it. The Ford dealer sold me a 24,000 mile warranty and did a transmission service. At 24,835 miles the transmission died. I called the Ford dealer. The salesman called me back, and told me there is nothing they could do to help, but recommend I get it fixed someplace cheaper than the dealer. They would want $1,800 to overhaul it. Some cities get $2,000. I found a $1,500 and a $1,200. The transmission shop owner informed me that they do many Ford Tarus's and Mercury Sable's. Ford knows what the problem is. The aluminum piston inside metal fatigues and cause the plenary gears to go out. Ford has redesigned a steal piston and a new line kit to get transmission fluid where it is needed inside. He installed the upgraded parts. Ford has not recalled this transmission and would do nothing to help me after owning the car for only 10 months with 38 months more to pay on it. I have a 1980 Dodge Truck. I spent more on the Sable in 10 months than in 19 years on my truck. Even though our family really likes the features inside the Sable and the v-6 engine is reliable, this will be my last. I need a transmission that will last more than 83,000 miles. The first car left me stranded two days before Thanksgiving 5 hours drive from my house. Chrysler or GM, Here I come. (Author was a Master ASE certified auto technican from 1990-1994).
