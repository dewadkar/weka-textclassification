            Ok where would I start from .... I bought this brand new from the dealership in 1995 and now have only 60000 miles. Let me tell you, I started to have problems with it when it was only 35000 miles, first was the driver's power window than the locks, after that the alternator. 

It has limited visibility to the road from inside. Most of the time I happen to hit my knee to dashboard when I get in to car. 

It rideï¿½s pretty rough, like driving with square tires, and just noticed new problem which the engine started to burn oil like crazy, I have to top it up every 2000 mile. 

Bottom line..this car is not worth a penny.
