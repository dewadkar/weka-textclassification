            I bought the car because it had all the features I needed/wanted in a 4 door passenger and commuting car.  

In a 5 speed the car has decent power with 2 passengers - over that and it has noticable lag.  In the automatic, which I have driven extensively as well, it is seriously underpowered.  I am very good to cars as a rule but the interior is good - I like a relatively spartan interior stylewise and the surfaces held up well for 80000 miles, with the exception of the parking brake lever boot, which wore out and tore within a year ($$$ to replace as you have to buy the entire lever assembly).  Another expense early on is the front lower reflectors if you do not have fog/driving lamps - the reflectors fall out easily and are $20 to replace.  More costly problems are the front disc brake calipers, which have a tendency to hang up - replacement cost $250 each with no aftermarket replacement available - and the distribution/spark plug cables which burn out and are EXTREMELY fragile -replacement either $70 for Mexican made OEM parts (low quality, burn out sooner) or $100+ for Bosch - both are still fragile due to the boot design.  Another significant problem is the throttle body which needs regular annual or 12000 mile servicing or it will fail - service is expensive and replacement is extremely expensive.  Also watch out for the catalytic converters, which have a relatively short life span and will fail between 60 and 100K miles. 

The car is fun to drive apart from its problems and low power, and is a good choice for anyone wanting a midsize 4 door car who do not mind driving a manual transmission.  People who love automatics would be better off elsewhere.<br><br>
