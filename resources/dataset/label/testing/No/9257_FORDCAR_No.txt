            My mother owns a '94 Ford Contour Special Edition four door sedan. There have been Six, SIX! Manufacturer's recalls on various parts of the vehicle. She was only notified of this AFTER the recalled item had effectively ruined another part of the automobile! (ex: The wiper blades malfunctioned and gouged her winshield). She takes impeccable care of it, yet things are constantly falling apart. The shop fixes one thing, and another goes wrong. Sure, all cars have their weak points, but it is ridiculous. Definately not a car for someone who doesn't know how to do home repairs.

Other than that it's a good little car. It has fast pick up, excellent braking, and the gas mileage is nothing short of miraculous for it's size. I'm almost sorry to put it down, but consumers deserve the truth.
