            About two years ago, my husband's Buick broke down and we searched and hunted for a replacement.  He enjoyed the comfort of the Buick and wanted something similar in size.  

We found the Mercury Sable by chance, and we were impressed with the soft, cushy seats, and the roominess of it.  We test drove one at a local used car dealership and enjoyed the ride.  It was a smooth ride, and still is.

In the past year, however, we have spent over $1,500.00 in repairs on the engine.  When we bought the car it was less than 4 years old, had 48,000 miles on it and belonged to one owner.  

The head work has been the most annoying of all, as well as the most expensive.  We've had vacuum leaks, we've had slight transmission slipping, and then the head needing to be re-shaped and the entire cooling system taken apart and cleaned.  Not only was this expensive work, but posed a greater difficulty for our (trusted) mechanic, who had to pretty much disassemble the entire front end to remove the radiator.  He also told us that he sees a LOT of the Sables and the Taurus (same car) in there for problems with the cooling system and suggested we have it checked and cleaned periodically, until we find a better car.

Like I said, if it wasn't for the massive amount of money we have put into the car in the past year, then it'd be a great car.  Sadly, it is not.
