            I had waited till now to go digital as I refused to pay more for a digital than I did (adjusted for inflation) for my old 35mm OM2 SLR (which incidently still does a fantastic job). On the specs the C-750 looked like it might do the job and it almost does. However the resolution is not quite there yet for the serious amature.

The software supplied works but it is not as convenient as Sony's which lets you hat swap the USB port and treats the camera just like an external drive.

HQ-Enhanced gives as sharp an image as Tiff mode, which says a lot for the compression algorithm, but not much for the resolving power of the CCD and lens. At five feet my eyes are still better than the 35mm lens and 4Mp CCD.

The manual focusing system leaves a lot to be desired, it would be much better to put it on the lens body as per the old 35mm SLR's, while they at it they could move the aperture back to the front of the camera as well; fiddling around with the menu keys which are under your cheek (it would be totally useless to a left handed person) does not make for good picture composition.

The camera is almost impossible to use at night unless you eat a lot of carrots, the logos are too small and indistinct to read in low light conditions.

And accessories are very expensive, I will certainly be looking at ways of using my old T20 flash before forking out for the dedicated FL20.

A major gripe was finding no battery charger or NiMh batteries in the box,despite being told that there would be by the retailer. Olympus Australia say that they marketed it as a "budget" box, not so by the price however, which at around A$1100 is at least 20% dearer than the RRP for the US and European model, (with charger and batteries included).

If I were to buy this camera again which I wouldn't, I would wait the extra 2 days and import it from the US. If Olympus Australia are as stingy on service as they are on sales, the warranty does not mean much anyway.

Back to the old OM2 and Muji Zoom for now.
