               I bought the Rodeo for a fairly inexpensive SUV, but now I rather feel like I got a CHEAP SUV. While the ride and practicality of the vehicle are nice, I've had a lot of little, but annoying problems with it over the last 2 years. 
   For starters, when the cruise control was used, the Check Engine light would come on after about 20 minutes (makes for a bit of a scary road trip when you're far from home). It turned out to be just an oxygen sensor though. 
   Next, the driver-side front and rear windows developed a dreadful scratchy noise which required a day at the shop. 
   The next shop visit came not long after when the wheels went out of alignment (within the first year, about 13,000 miles, and no rough driving). 
   Another disappointment was that the Rodeo is quite loud and had major wind noise when driving on the highway. Also, there have been 2 or 3 very annoying squeaks coming from different parts of the vehicle that I never identified. 
   Finally, the center console/drink holder is cheaply made, and the spare tire tends to block the rear view.
   On the positive side, the Rodeo has been very useful to me. It has a good amount of cargo space and is comfortable to ride in (at least in the front, I've had rear seat passengers complain about uncomfortable seats). 4-wheel drive works well (just make sure you have appropriate tires for the terrain, I got stuck in the mud once with the factory &quot;good weather&quot; tires that came with it). If you don't mind a few minor annoyances it is a good truck, but for the past 2 and 1/2 years, I've really been thinking that I could have found something better for the money.
   The good thing is that it's a lease, so I'll only have it 6 more months. I definitely will be doing my &quot;homework&quot; to find a better SUV.

** Update** This update comes a couple of months after writing this review. My Rodeo died on me (fortunately it died at home). It turned out to be the battery. The one that came with the Rodeo, a Delco, only lasted 2.5 years. That's the shortest lasting battery that I've ever had. I thought that it would at least make it through the 3 year lease period, but oh well. The battery warranty is only 12 months so I had to spring for a new one at the local auto parts store ($40)(the Isuzu dealership was going to charge me $200 for the battery and labor). Not a big problem, but it was a bit of a hassle.<br><br>
