            Car makers build certain cars because they fill a need, they spend millions on research designed to figure out who will buy which car.  Is there really a need for an Oldsmobile minivan?? The Silhouette is not a BAD car, it's just not great either.  

The Oldsmobile Silhouette is obviously intended to be an upscale minivan (isn't that an oxymoron??), competing with the likes of Chrysler Town & Country. Frankly the Pontiac Montana is much better.  Even though the Montana and the Silhouette are virtually the same car, the Montana somehow comes off as more useful, more functional.  Minivans are all about usefulness, not luxury - you want luxury, buy an Oldsmobile Aurora or a Lexus.

The Silhouette rides and drives much like the Montana, smooth but rather soft,  however the Silhouette sits about 1 inch lower.  Most of the switchgear inside is identical, however lack the big, useful and durable feel found on the same switches in the Montana.  The Silhouette has a second row of seats just like the Montana, but the Silhouette gives you second row seating for only two, while the Montana has seating for three.  Also the second row seats in the Montana fold down to reveal hard plastic table-top like surfaces with cup holders, the Silhouette has this only in the very back (3rd) row.  The  3400 V-6  is smooth and acceleration is average.  Power sliding side door is very useful, but many minivans now have this feature. Motorized rear pop-out windows are a nice touch, but many owners have complained about premature failure.  Stereo sounds good, and steering wheel mounted controls are very helpful.  Rear air compressor is an excellent idea.

The premiere edition of the Silhouette stickers at about $32,000.  That's a lot of money for a  minivan, granted it's a luxury minivan, but still $32K is a lot.  Speaking of luxury, the Silhouette lacks some luxury features found on almost every other Oldsmobile.  Luxury cars should have climate control, cornering lights,  and a CD changer. The entertainment package is great, TV/VCR and separate audio controls for the back seat (kids) passengers are very useful on long trips.

So the question remains, what is the point?   Why would you buy this over a Chevrolet Venture, Pontiac Montana, Dodge Caravan, or Honda Odyssey?  The  only possible answer would be styling, it looks a little different on the outside, otherwise there is no reason to choose the Silhouette.  You can get the same features on other, less expensive minivans. It wouldn't be surprising if Oldsmobile does NOT have a minivan in it's long term plans. 

As a side note, the Silhouette has an optional "gold package."  C'mon, cars with gold trim do not look better or classy, it's even worse on a minivan.  If you have to TRY to make something look classy, it probably isn't.  You don't need gold trim on a Mercedes or a Bentley to make it look classy.

Overall the Silhouette is not a bad minivan, but it's not great either.  Others in the Silhouette's  class are more versatile and cheaper.  Mechanical twins  Chevrolet Venture and Pontiac Montana are much better values.
