            I don't know why Lexus released this so called &quot;SUV&quot; in the first place.  SUV's were originally designed to be trucks that seat five people and can go anywhere.  This though, does not fit in with the sport utility guidelines.  It is basically a raised sedan!  It was built on the camry platform even though it is better to build and SUV on a truck platform.  Also, the price for this is outrageous!  Around $33,000 for an entry-level sized luxury SUV.  You can get a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a V-8 for the price of that!  The engine that the RX 300 has is also very weak.  A 3.0 Liter 6 cylinder engine that comes from the ES 300 does not have enough power for that SUV.  The interior is very comfortable for the size of the car and there are many options standard.  Even with all these standard options, the price of $33,000 is still outrageous.  There are much better buys for the price.  It was recently rated Consumer Digests best sport utility, even though it is not really a sport utility.  The exterior styling is also very horrible!  It looks like a bubble with wheels.  If you are considering buying one of these sport utilities, try looking at Jeeps and Fords first.<br><br>
