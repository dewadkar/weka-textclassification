            When my husband and I purchased our 1995 V6 manual transmission Passat my expectations were pretty low of VW and they have remained that way.  Unfortunately we were seduced by the powerful ride and fun driving experience of this car and struck with new car fever.

The first two years we owned this car the mileage was under 20K.  The car began shutting off at stop lights.  The dealer said the electrical core needed to be replaced for $1500.  We have never repaired it and it has never worked properly.

Then the left rear passenger side began leaking and of course the repair shop could not replicate the problem.  Sometimes we can't open the power locks on the doors.  And this year the AM radio stopped working.  The dealer says the roof has to be removed to make this repair and it it's about $500.

Other problems include the donut which went flat and can't be reinflated, the rear window doesn't work anymore and  the front axle had to be replaced.  A minor but quite visible one is the beige interior which cannot be cleaned thoroughly and looks crappy now.  Oh, and one more thing the fan does not work on the one setting only two and above.

On the up side..
The clutch and transmission have never been a problem nor has the moonroof.  But all of the other problems we have are very annoying. 

If you like fixing cars or quirky problems then this is the car for you.  But if you are looking for reliability STAY AWAY.  I don't know which Passat the folks at Consumer Reports are driving.  I have lost a lot of respect for them because this car should not be highly rated.  It's more like a Mitsubishi on the repair front.
