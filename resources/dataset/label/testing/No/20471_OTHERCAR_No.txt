               I bought a new vehicle because I am a single mom and could no longer afford to make constant repairs to an older vehicle.  I owned a Chevy Z28 and I loved it so I decided to buy another Chevy.  I bought a brand new 1996 Chevy Lumina Sedan, fully loaded and paid $20,000. for it.  Now that I have only 2 more payments before I own it, I had to have work done to the engine.  Beware of problems with the head gasket or intake manifold gasket and if you change your oil and filters yourself like I do, please,please save every last receipt for what you bought.  I am now stuck with paying over $450. for repairs that aren't guaranteed at all.  The dealership wanted almost $2000. for even more work that also would not be guaranteed, at all.  The problem was caused by a faulty intake manifold gasket that let the antifreeze and oil mix.  As you can imagine,this caused the oil to breakdown and cause major damage to the internal parts of the engine.  The dealership told me that even if I have everything repaired that they suggest, they would not guarantee that the engine would not seize due to damage that is non-reversible.  Why pay $2000. for a repair on a car that could be worthless at any given time.  GM said they will not help with any incurred repair costs if I cannot show receipts of the maintenance I did myself.  I used to love my Lumina, I'll never buy another one. I cannot control a faulty gasket.
