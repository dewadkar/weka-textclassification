            Overall I am satisfied with this camera. It does its job. It's takes pictures and puts them on my computer when I tell it to.  So why do I have doubts? Simple, it could be better. 

Since this is my second camera it is an upgrade from the first digital we had. That was junk. This one is not. I've had no problems installing the software, it was quick and easy and painless. The batteries recharge when plugged into a wall through the camera, no needed extras. It's basic's are easy to learn and easy to use. The Rec/Play button is all that is needed (well, that and the delete feature). Just press the button; take the picture, drop the switch from Rec to Play and you see what you've taken a picture of. Also, the choice of Economy, Normal and Fine pictures is a great asset. In general it's small, compact and does its job well.

Now the bads come in. It's focusing is horrible. You have to stay perfectly still (i.e. I had to lean on a wall to have a clear photo). It is not good for anything that even moves remotely (i.e. we can't take pet photos!) since the pictures become blurred. 

The lens is near the top and fingers tend to be in many shots. You have to contort funny to take decent shots. 

The colors come out awful. My red shirt came out flamingo, my brown pants orange, and my purple and red shirts look identical. I had to do hours of computer editing to get the colors back to normal. I stress the hours part.

One main flaw it has is all of its silly features. The 3.2-second movie thing for instance, I've never used it nor will I ever. What use is a 3.2-second movie? We have a camcorder for that. I can't even tell you half of its uses since I don't care of need them. Mom took some photos of friends and made 3 copies show up on one photo (a collage), but seriously though how needed it that? I find some of its features to just be wasted and pointless.

Overall it does it's job, but could be better.
