            I got my Tercel 94 DX Sedan Automatic, about two months ago and overall I like driving it. Although it is very small on the inside, almost no leg/head room, it makes a perfect city car. It is really easy to control, which could be a problem for some people since a little movement of the steering wheel causes the car to go back and forth. Good gas mileage. Very easy to park because of the sensitive steering wheel and small body.

The acceleration, in my opinion, is a little slower than I want it to be, but it's ok for most people. The gas mileage I am getting in the city is around 26-27. Which is not that bad for a 94' car. 


Very uncomfortable during long trips. During several trips from San Francisco to Los Angeles, even with several stops, I developed neck pains, and other problems, and so did my passengers.

Definitely not a car for a claustrophobic.<br><br>
