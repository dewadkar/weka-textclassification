            I have just picked my car up from the dealer for yet another sensor malfunction. I figured I cant be the only one with this problem. After visiting carsurvey.org and other review sites, I thought I'd look up Jetta reviews on Epinions. Wow, pretty good reviews for a car that I now know is plagued with quality problems. Then I figured it out. 

Out of 77 reviews, over 50 of them were written before 2001! As you read some of the reviews written in 2001 and 2002, you will notice the word 'lemon' starts to creep into the titles. Coincidence? Not in my case. 

Here is a list of the problems I'm experiencing:

* Door oozing lubricant constantly since day 1 (The amazing thing is that there is still ooze to leak out after 2  years) Oh yeah, this is *normal* according to the dealer! If you haven't seen the Jetta Ooze phenomenon in person it's not what you think - were not talking drops here and there, this is ooze!
* Sensor that keeps going out and causes the check engine light to come on. The dealers know about this and it's not confined to the 2000 Jetta. 
* 6 Disk CD Changer cuts out/skips all the time.
* Glovebox door hinge broke in half.
* Passenger side seat coil/spring popped off (allows seat to move vertically up and down).
* Strange lags and lurches in acceleration.
* Rear brakes squeaked like hell - dealer advised to replace (only 16000 miles and not under warranty).
* Weak air conditioning & musty air conditioning smell.
* Rear tweeter sounding scratchy.
* Cup Holder jams intermittently.
* Creaks, squeaks and rattles *too numerous* to list and getting worse everyday.

"This guy sure is hard on his car," you must be saying by now. With 16000 miles after over 2 years, myself being the primary occupant, I would beg to differ. After doing a little research and visiting other consumer review sites it would appear I'm not alone in my opinion: VW quality control is crap. Glad my lease is almost up. Buyer beware.
