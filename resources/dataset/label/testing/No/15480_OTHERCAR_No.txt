            This is basically an upgrade of the fd-81 which I absolutely adored.  I'm recommending holding off, because sonys new 2000 product line takes advantage of the new SONY memory stick.  This means that with a memory stick and floppy adapter (MSAC-FD2M), you can store up to 64mb of photos vs. the 1.44mb that you are restricted to with this camera.  The memory stick and adapter don't come cheap.  However this is the way all new SONY digital products are going.  If you don't mind carrying around of floppy disks and you find a good price on this camera (around $500-$550) you will be very happy.  It features a 4 speed floppy drive that is quick and reliable.  The flash is a little on the weak side however.  Also the images displayed on the LCD screen suffer from slow down.  The pictures are average compared to what is out there now.  I would recommend this for first timers wanting an inexpensive camera with the ease of use the floppy provides  There are plenty of features to play with and keep you busy.  It just doesn't compare with the megapixel cameras that are coming out now, and the lack of the memory stick really hurts this camera.<br><br>
