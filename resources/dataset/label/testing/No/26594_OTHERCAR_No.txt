            Several years ago my father bought a new car and instead of selling his 89 Chrysler New Yorker, he gave it to us. We did need a car at the time so we were glad to get it. Okay, I should rephrase that - I was glad to get it. My husband said �That car is going to be a money pit.� He was never more right about anything.

When my dad gave us the car it had about 40,000 miles on it. Now normally that would be considered low mileage. Not so with a New Yorker. I really think it�s kind of like how one dog year is equal to seven human years. New Yorker miles should at least be quadrupled to compare them with other cars.

Here are a few of the problems we had with this car, which my husband nicknamed the �mafia mobile� because he felt like a gangster driving it. The motors to two of the windows broke. The stereo worked occasionally. Actually it was more like rarely. I�m sure part of that had to do with the fact that the motor to the antenna didn�t work either. Then there was the air conditioning. We live in Southern California and although it doesn�t get as hot here as it does in some parts of the country I am a wimp when it comes to heat and I need air conditioning. The air conditioning kind of worked. When I say that it kind of worked I mean that it worked but it also leaked inside the car. I had to have a bucket where the front passenger�s feet would go to catch the water. Now it wasn�t just a little bit of water. When I would empty the bucket after driving for 45 minutes there was at least two cups of water in it.

Believe it or not I would consider all of the above items minor compared to the problem that we had with the brakes. Now I don�t know about you but I consider the brakes to be a pretty important part of a car. One day I�m driving along and without warning I have no brakes - none whatsoever. Fortunately, I was able to pull into a parking lot and called AAA. I had the car towed to a service station nearby. Well, that was a mistake because only the dealer, who you know is going to charge you an arm and a leg, can fix this problem. You see, it�s not really a problem with the brakes - it�s a problem with the computer that operates the brakes. I forget exactly what the part is called but it set us back $1,600. Now I figure we got the car for free so if we have to pay this money to fix the car then that�s okay. And if this had been the only time we had a problem with the brakes that would have been okay. In all fairness I have to admit that it was over a year till we had the same problem again. One day I�m driving along and the same thing happens again. I leave the car where it is, come home and tell my husband the story. He goes to get it and the brakes work fine. So even though the brakes are working now we take the car to the dealer and it takes him forever to actually make the brakes fail again.  Eventually he does get the brakes to fail and once again it�s a problem with the computer that runs the brakes. But this time it�s a different part and it costs us $1,200. But the kicker is that the mechanic told us he couldn�t be sure that there wasn�t anything else wrong with it!

So we decide we are going to sell the car. But before we sell it, the brakes go out again. We figure this time it should be covered by the warranty since we just had it fixed. Wrong. It is a different part this time and it costs us another $400. At this point I was ready to turn Chrysler into the Better Business Bureau. But I really just wanted to get rid of the car before we had to sink any more money into it. So we paid the $400 to fix the brakes and immediately took the car to a used car lot. We got $1,500 for it and I was thrilled to be rid of it.

So the bottom line is, if someone offers to give you a Chrysler New Yorker for free, don�t take it, you�ll be money ahead.
