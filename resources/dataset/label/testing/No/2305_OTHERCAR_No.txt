            The body of this car hasn't fallen apart while I am driving by a mere miracle.  he a/c vent have fallen off.. the arm rest is broken.. the window seals and door seals have un-glued themselves from the car.... it's all a mess you would think its a 1980 by the looks of the falling body parts...it be good to use this car is scary movies..The transmission was just replaced an the fuel tank was replaced.... let me see whatelse,  the brakes have been replaced and rotars over 4 times within a 3 year range...and get this the car only has 46,000 miles.  why so little mileage ...wellllets see it has probably spent 60% of it's life with me at the dealer...and not drivable because of the continous engine problems... the engine light comes on.. the oeverdrive light turns on..  it chokes...and it has been towed about 20 times that Geico told me... one more to and I will loose my towing privilages for that car.  welll it isn't my fault... the car has left me stranded...whatelse am I to do?  jsut avoid all KIAS please.
