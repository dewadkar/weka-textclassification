            Much as we love them there are times when my and my girlfriend&#146s cars, the smallest things to come out of Bavaria since Gateaux, just won&#146t cut it. The last ten days have been such times. Faced with the prospect of 3 friends, connected by ABBA like past and present sexual histories and their attendant baggage (lesbians do not travel light) we were forced to admit defeat. A call to the nice people at Enterprise and a brief to bring us a car that was &#147Big enough for five and their luggage, comfortable enough for a 6 hr drive through the Catskills and beyond and still enough fun to have us awake at the wheel after an hour&#148 saw what was soon to be known as &#145The Hearse&#146 arrive at our door.

I&#146ll be honest here &#150 we lived with The Hearse (a black PT Cruiser GT with heavily tinted windows) for only 10 days &#150 but we managed a healthy 1700 miles during those days and feel qualified enough to give you some kind of feedback.

Now the PT Cruiser is no longer a new car &#150 it&#146s due for replacement next year &#150 but the GT is still a bit of a head-turner (and some would say a cap doffer &#150 as the older and more respectful up in the mountains took off their hats as we past as a sign of respect for the dead) and in a world of automotive pygmies there&#146s still enough of the giant about this car to keep you interested. I&#146ve long said that Chrysler is the only US car company showing any imagination in the US &#150 and this is the proof in the metal of that belief.

Enough of the rambling however and on to the interesting stuff.

PERFORMANCE

The GT is powered by a turbo charged 2.4L engine developing 215bhp@ 5,000 rpm and 245lbs of shove at a more ear friendly 3,600 revs. Claimed 0-60 time is 7.5 seconds.

Alas the numbers fail to tell the whole story however. The PTGT (as we screamingly if not hysterically also named it) lacks real punch at the bottom end of the range. It&#146s not until the turbo kicks in (and it does kick in there&#146s nothing subtle about it) that you really feel that this is a fast car. It&#146s a kind of on / off performer, either shrugging sluggishly as you hit the pedal or else kicking in, punching you in the back and taking off faster than a businessman caught watching porn by his hotel maid.

So yes it quick but it&#146s not subtle and it&#146s not flexible. Chrysler &#150 take a look at VW&#146s 1.8 turbo engine and think again

RIDE AND HANDLING

The PTGT is not a big car &#150 until that is you try to turn it around. I&#146ve seen oil tankers turn in a tighter circle. Three point turns become five point turns as you struggle with the lack of turning circle &#150 going full lock to full lock in the hope that the wheels will turn more than a fraction of an inch. I&#146m not sure I understand why it must be so &#150 any hints anyone?

Gear changes are light and reasonably precise, tyres are  grippy and best of all the handling doesn&#146t seem to be unduly affected by weight &#150 The Hearse feeling a spry fully loaded as it did with only one up. Not at all bad and much better than anticipated.

REFINEMENT

The Cruiser does okay here. Wind noise is better suppressed than I&#146d imagined it would be in something quite a slab sided as this car and the whole thing feels more car than van. It&#146s happier cruising at speed than it is in the city (hence the name I suppose) and can get a little gruff under acceleration.

BEHIND THE WHEEL

Inside the car it&#146s all a little disappointing. The bravery that went into the exterior didn&#146t carry through to the interior and it all looks just a little bit standard for my liking. It&#146s al a little 1990s Toyota.

Swathes of dark grey cloth hardly lift the sombre mood either.

Seats are of the &#145you must have a huge arrse&#146 American school &#150 soft, comfy and ample.

Meanwhile gauges are nicely laid out if a little on the &#145brittle plastic&#146 side. There&#146s something about shiny plastic that makes me think badly made market toy rather than quality automobile and the Cruiser is guilty of shiny plastics almost everywhere you look.

Duller than you&#146d think &#150 but practical I guess (is this what Cruiser buyers want?)

SPACE / PRACTICALITY

Chrysler would have you believe that the Cruiser as the most practical car on the road. Not true. It&#146s not even a proper MPV. Look at Europe&#146s Opel Zafira or at the mad but brilliant Fiat Multipla and you&#146ll see what I mean.

The Cruiser is nothing more than a car with room for 5, a couple of extra cubby holes in which children can hide things that will mould up over months and a promise of removable seats. Well yes they are removable &#150 if you can lift them. The rear seat must account for about 40% of the whole car&#146s body weight and I defy anyone to move it alone. It&#146s heavy, cumbersome and positively counter-intuitive.

Not only that &#150 whilst the PTGT has room for five &#150 it doesn&#146t have seats for them. The rear seat splits 60 / 40 and is of the &#145bench style&#146 &#150 rather than being 3 individual seats. Cue arguments about who last sat in the middle (&#145the seat of death&#146) and harping about the poor design.

So despite getting us and our luggage to where we wanted to go the Cruiser was a bit of a let down here.

EQUIPMENT

Liked the compass &#150 genuinely handy. Radio was huge and took both CDS and tapes &#150 only tried the former and sound was okay, no better. Controls fiddly. Cruise, traction control, alarm all handy. Power sunroof a positive boon &#150 very nice indeed. Leather seats always nice &#150 though the leather seemed to have been taken from what must have been very old cows given its sags and wrinkles (a description not lost on the inhabitants of PTGT I assure you)

It&#146s well stacked

BUYING / OWNING

Not a cheap proposition the GT, but the warranty is good and the economy (we managed 23 mpg) isn&#146t bad for the US (but is still shocking people&#133). Residuals are softening now and the new car will hit the resale value of this one. Negotiate big discounts would be my advice.

QUALITY / RELIABILITY

The mechanicals are tough and proven &#150 you shouldn&#146t have a problem there. Flimsy trim and those brittle plastics worry me though.

SAFETY

We had 4 wheel ABS, 4 air bags (no side airbags that I could see) and traction control. That was about it. The Cruiser is a pretty solid car however and has performed well in safety tests. Visibility was good and the car inspired confidence, no worries I&#146d say.


SUMMARY

So 1,700 miles, 21 arguments, 6 missed turns, 412 toilet breaks, 5 this is the last one Whopper Meals later and The Hearse has gone back to Enterprise. It was a funny old car &#150 once driving it you forgot that from the outside it looked special and I think that that&#146s a shame.

Performance and handling were adequate but they lacked a little &#145fizz&#146. The interior was dark and bland, lacking personality. Practicality? Well it got us there and back and hauled our stuff but not quite as easily as we&#146d have hoped.

I guess that what this comes down to is that the PT Cruiser GT promises a lot and delivers just more than average &#150 leaving you feeling more deflated than exhilarated.
