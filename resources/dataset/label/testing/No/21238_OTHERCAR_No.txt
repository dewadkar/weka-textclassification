            Why would i buy this vehicle?  Simple.  It will last forever and it will give you good gas mileage.  

But is this what you really want?  A car is a driving experience and my New Camry doesn't do it for me.  

The Camry is my graduation gift from my grandparents.  Lovely people, but they got it all wrong...A car is your second home and driving should be an experience, not a chore.

Interior
The car looks good and I must give Toyota &quot;props&quot; for making the controls in reach of the driver.  But comfort is another story.  The seats feel like you are sitting on leather-wrapped patio furniture.  Definately the comfort I desire.  Taking the hour long commutes seems ugh!

Forget about backseat room.  This car wasn't made for the drive-in (unless you LIKE watching the movie).  I would recommend the backseat for kids.  2 adults have a hard time sitting back there.

The other positive is the &quot;Japanese Silence Box&quot;.  You hear no noise.  Not from the tires, not from the road, and not from the engine.  The last one I don't like b/c i like listening to the purr of my engine.  

Exterior
The car is made of shotty sheet metal.  My friend's wife crashed hers at 20 mph and caused $6000 worth of repair.  Oh, and the chevy she ran into....$250 worth of damage.  You do the math.  The paint job isn't that great either with the paint already fading.  

Power
Underpowered.  Even with the v6, this car is a bust.  Maybe i just want more power, but the camry doesn't do it for me off the line.  50 more horsepower would've done the trick.
