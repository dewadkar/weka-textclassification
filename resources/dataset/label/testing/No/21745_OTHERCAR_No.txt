            My fiancee Kimberly has owned a 1998 Chevy Cavalier for a couple of years now, and I've logged plenty of hours behind the wheel.  I don't have any serious complaints about it--I've driven it clear from Texas to California.  It's got about 20,000 miles on it, and we haven't had any major problems.  It is very plain, however; the base model is relatively inexpensive, and looks so.  But, as I've said, what do you want for $12,000?  That's what a good deal on this entry-level car will run you.

And, ultimately, it is a good deal, particularly for a first car; GM has some great deals for the first-time buyer.  They want to insure that you'll buy GM in the future, so they give you a break from the start.  The car itself runs well, for the most part; we had some issues with hesitation and stalling for a bit, but after an oil change, they went away.  Other than that, it's been reliable; Chevy's become much better at producing reliable cars that require very little maintenance.  It's got adequate power to keep up with freeway traffic, the automatic transmission is smooth, the ride is reasonably comfortable, even on long trips.

It's also bigger than most entry-level sedans; two adults of average height can ride comfortably in the back.  The instruments are rudimentary, but easy to read; the sound system is very basic, and the seat adjustment is rough.  Everything is manual, windows, locks, mirrors, etc., and there's no rear defroster, but again, we're talking about the base model.  It's a perfectly reasonable deal for $12,000 and a first car.<br><br>
