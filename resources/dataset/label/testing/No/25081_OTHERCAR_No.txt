            I got this Cavalier as a rental when my car was wrecked.  It's an okay car to rent, but I would never own one.

It is one of the most uncomfortable cars I have ever driven.  I am a mother of two, a teen-ager and a pre-teen, and I spend a lot of time in my car.  Comfort is one of the biggest things that I look for.  The Cavalier does not have it.

Gas mileage is another biggie for a working mom like me.  The mileage is also very bad.  I drive about 70 miles round trip to work, and must fill up twice a week.

Some good points are that it is a nice looking car, sporty, yet large enough to meet our needs.  I also like the fact that there are outlets for a phone charger on both the driver and passenger sides.

Those are the only pros I can think of, now back to the cons. The engine is sluggish at best.  It runs okay on the freeway, but this isn't a car to drive when negotiating a lot of traffic.  Forget about ever making a quick get-a-way out of a parking lot into traffic.

I feel that there are much better cars, in the same price range out there.  This isn't a car that I would ever purchase for myself.
