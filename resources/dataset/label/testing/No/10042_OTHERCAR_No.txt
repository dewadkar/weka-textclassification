            I bought this car brand new off the lot at Auburn Valley KIA from the Giant Of The Valley.  The first problem was a dead battery, which should have forewarned me of the future, but I was blinded by the appeal of a new car.  At about 10,000 miles I noticed the brakes hopping while braking and so I took it in, the dealership said that the front and rear brake pads and shoes and drums and rotors were totally shot, as in metal on metal grinding.  Thankfully the car was under warranty and it was repaired free of charge.  The second thing to go wrong was, out of the blue, the radio knob fell off and I was no longer able to adjust the volume until I installed a pair of needle nose vise grips to the spot where the knob was.  The dealer said no problem a new stereo will be in in two weeks.  Two weeks later the power windows stop working and I return to the dealer for this and to check on my radio, the dealer informs me that the radio that was sent was not a cd player like mine and it will be another two weeks and the window parts will be in then too.  After another two weeks, I find out that the radio will be another three weeks for what ever reason and they replace my main window control switch in the drivers side to repair the windows.  I failed to mention, in typing this, that, I had to take a day off of work each time that I went to get something taken care of since the dealership closes at 4:00pm and is not open on saturday's.  The road noise I noticed after about a week and was told that that is normal for the car and when the brakes went out I was told that it was some thing that they knew about but I was not informed about, the same went for the window problem.  The gas mileage never got above 22 MPG city or hwy., and the sticker said it would get more like 28-30MPG, The good thing about it was the looks when the tail fin was added and that is about it for it.  I finally got smart and tried to contact the dealership heads and got nowhere and got the same results at KIA so I traded it in for a Chevy S-10 instead and now I am still paying for it since the dealer stuck me like a pig in the deal,  I ended up paying 14,000 for a 9,000 dollar car. BUYER BEWARE OF DEALERS!!!!!!!!!!!

P.S.  The rear letters "LS" started to fall off and after it became warm outside and after washing the car.
