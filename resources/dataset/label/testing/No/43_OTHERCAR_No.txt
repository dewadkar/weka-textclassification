            I bought my Amigo new in 1998.  The first week I had the car, there was a noise in the front end.  I took the car in and a "cross bar" had come loose from the suspension.   

The second time it happened, I took it in and the dealership fixed it again.  The third time it happened the dealership wanted me to leave it all day AGAIN.  I said "no, I know what is wrong with it and I'm not leaving it all day again.  I will come in and you can fix it while I am there".  So, they fixed it again and told me every time, that the bolts kept coming losing and they had now changed them so it shouldn't happen again.  

During this time, the dome light would intermittently come on and off during driving.  First time...they said they fixed it.  I drove off the lot and it happened again.  Second time I was told that the tailgate "switch" was placed to far back and they moved it up so that it would connect better when the tailgate closed.  

Driving down the road one day, the sunroof cover fell on my head. Took the car in.  They fix it.  Two weeks later it happens again.  They then have a recall: #98V-260: "The primer applied to prepare the surface prior to bonding the sunshade holders to the sunroof weakened bonding strength of the adhesive, resulting in an unsatisfactory bond of the holder to the sunroof.  The poor bond could result in separation of the holder, causing the sunshade to fall, possibly striking a vehicle occupant."   I could've had a serious accident both times.   

Recall notice #2 98V-111:"Incorrect rear seat belt shoulder anchor bolts were fitted in production, which could result in failure of the rear seat belts to provide proper protection in the event of a vehicle crash."  Took the car in, the car is in the shop all day again. (it took 4 months to get the parts to fix this recall problem). 

Recall notice #3 9802L3: "The integrated attachment clip located on the back of the accelerator pedal pad may break.  The accelerator pedal pad will become loose from the accelerator rod assembly and the pad may slop off."  Took the car in, it is in the shop all day.  

My rearview mirror falls off while driving during my 3rd month owning the car.  I don't bother taking the car in, because I cannot afford another "rental car" bill.    

Two months into owning the car, I notice the stitching coming out of one of the windows (on the convertible top).  I call the dealership.  They want me to bring the car in and have an Isuzu Rep. look at it.   He does and concludes that I have put the top down with the windows left in and it is causing the stitching to come out.  I call the customer service and they again say "this is consistent with owners putting the top down with the windows left in."   I explain over and over and over again that I have never done this.   They continue to repeat this back to me every time I would call.   I then talk to the customer service manager at Isuzu.   I ask him if he is calling me a liar, because I have NEVER put the top down with the windows left in.  He said "well, we are certainly not calling you a liar, however, we do not know what the dealership did to the car before you bought it."   They were rude and had a spiel for every thing.   They even had the nerve to say that the stitching could not possibly ever coming out of the window due to poor manufacturing!!!!   I had to call the owner of the dealership and tell him that now Isuzu was placing the blame on what they had done to the car before I even owned it.   I finally got my window, but the dealership had to pay for it.  

If you want a lot of headaches and no help solving your car problems, the please do buy an Amigo  (which is spelled incorrectly on the car, if you look at the name it is actually spelled, Anigo!!!  That should tell you what morons they are).

UPDATE: 3/03
Recall notice:  ABS system needs replaced because during stopping, may malfunction and extend stopping distance that could lead to an adcident.
**I noticed this the first year I had this car.  I kept telling people that even if I ran over a tiny pebble, it would take 15 feet for the car to stop and was told many times that that is how Anti-Lock breaks work!
