            I bought this camera 2 weeks ago at U-Bid, an online auction site, for $139. The camera has a $50 Rebate, so my cost is $89. I have taken many photos with this camera, both indoors and outdoors. I have found that the indoor shots come out pretty well as long as you are not shooting beyond the cameras flash length, which seems to be about 10'. Beyond that the picture quality deteriorates rapidly. Within 10' the photos are crisp and with good color balance. The outdoor shots have been better than the indoor shots. The colors are very vivid and accurate. The 1.5" LCD is difficult to view in sunlight, but this is true of all the Digital cameras I have seen. The Battery life seems to be not real great, I got about 125 shots out a a set of 4 AA batteries, which is not real great. I have purchased 2 sets of NiMh batteries, and a charger so I can use one set and charge the other set. This camera has 1.3 Mega Pixels, and does a pretty good job on printed photos up to 5x7". The camera comes with an internal 8mb storage,and has a slot for removable storage of Compact Flash Type I. In the highest resolution the 8mb will hold 17 photos.
The Software Pkg. is very good. It comes with Photo Suite SE. I have found that program to be very good at correcting the indoor photos and have been able to enhance these shots enough to make them pretty darn good. It has a number of Special Effects that are pretty cool as well.
All things considered, I would recommend this camera, but only for a starter camera, or for an inexperienced photographer. I will be passing this camera on to my 16 year old son when I decide on a 4 megapixel camera for myself. 

UPDATE 3-30-02

We have had to return this camera for warranty service. The camera will turn itself off after taking a picture. Then it would not turn on at all. I got the camera back 3 weeks ago, all seemed fine for a short time. Now the camera is repeating it's earlier behavior, in turning itself off. I contacted Pentax, and they said to send it back for another repair attempt. I'm very upset about this, and hope Pentax will just replace it with a new camera, we'll see!!
