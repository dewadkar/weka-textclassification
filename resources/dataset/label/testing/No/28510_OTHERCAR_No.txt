            As a Saab owner my decision was easy.  I would trade in my trusty 900 convertible with 150k on the clock for a shiny, new, practical 9-3 SE 5 door.

With the 205hp motor and 5 speed I would still feel like I was driving a sports car but would have all the practicality of owning a near station wagon.  Saabs have a unique style in many ways and the appearance of the car is stunning.  It is loaded with many great features and thoughtful designs.

My praise for this car runs out there.  I have leased this car for about 9 months and have become increasingly annoyed as my ownership experience rolls on.  Being nibbled on by little squeaks and rattles, I have been given some really stupid and unacceptable explanations for a car of this stature.  Pieces of trim have fallen out and I have made at least 8 visits to the dealer to have them addressed including an appointment with one of the factory representatives.  Below I will list the shortcomings of the car and then I can get into what my experiences have been with the service department.  The number in parentheses indicates number of visits to dealer.

Grille piece fell off   (1)
Sunroof rattles and whistles  (4)
Drivers seat creaks EVERY TIME I DEPRESS THE CLUTCH (2)
Intermittant squeak when going over large bumps  (3)
Rattling of suspension parts (1)
Headlamp wiper often times askew  (2)
Annoying squeak in suspension WHENEVER I GET INTO THE CAR (2)

There should be no mistake that this car is fun to drive on a newly paved road with no manholes, expansion joints.  And Carter Saab's service department has worked hard on trying to fix some of the problems with the car.  But these are some of the remedies that they offered when they gave the car back to me after a &quot;repair&quot;.

Your cel phone was rolling around in the trunk--technician clearly not interested in truly troubleshooting any problems with the car when he offered this one up.
Your license plate was loose on the trunk--this one speaks for itself
All our other cars do the same thing--if this is the case you will not be in business for long.  If I was working for Saab, I would be embarrassed to utter these words.
Your not pulling up hard enough on the parking brake lever--If I were to pull up any harder on the brake lever, it would be awfully difficult for my wife to disengage it.

I took these responses to be dumb, patronizing remarks to a white collar customer who could not possibly know is butt from his elbow when it comes to cars.  When I took the manufacturers representative on a test run with it he simply told me that he could not hear the noises at all.  Then he told me that he could hear a noise on one of the &quot;grab handles&quot; located directly over my door.  If he could not hear a sound in the sunroof, how could he hear a noise on my grab handle?  It gets really interesting when I had taken a mechanic for a ride and he heard the sound without any problem and diagnosed it to the sunroof.  While Saab has admitted to having problems with the sunroof, they will not fix it.  It is my understanding that the sunroof repair would be over $2000.00.  Since my meeting with Saab I have requested a 6 disk changer for the car so that I do not have to listen to symphony of sounds that the car makes.


The extensive list of problems with this car and its fit and finish issues are unacceptable.  There is a reason why this car is less expensive than an Audi, BMW or Mercedes.  It should not be looked at a viable competitor to any of these cars.  While it does offer styling and performance, quality is low.  It lacks the certain Fort Knox type feel of the big three German cars.  Based on Saab's attitude toward their customers they will likely never be a competitor.

If you are a car enthusiast and are turned on my high quality then this car is not for you.  If rattles, whistles, squeaks and creaks do not bother you then this car is a hoot to drive and you probably will not have any problem.
