            My wife and I bought a new 95 Nissan Sentra from a local dealer.  I have to say it has been the most undependable vehicle I have ever owned!!

GOOD POINTS:
at least the tires &amp; Paint are still good

Bad Points:
$1500 worth of brake work
2 different factory recalls, both of which the dealer tried to charge us for
numerous minor engine problems $100+ each time
door lock and unlock on there own for the past 3 years
auto window buttons are flimsy to say the least
had to threaten to sue Nissan to get a factory defect fixed
cost way to much 

Many more problems to numerous to mention
