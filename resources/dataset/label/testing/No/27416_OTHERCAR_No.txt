            I bought my '95 Dodge Neon in 1994, and have had it for 5 1/2 years.
If it weren't for all the problems I have had, I might buy another one.
It has a lot better inside room than other competing subcompacts, has pretty good handling (as long as there's no ice), good gas mileage, good looks, and was one of the cheaper cars around.

However, these are the following problems I had with it. (This is with
regular oil changes every 3,000 miles)

1) Faulty brake switch, which caused the brake lights to stay on and
drain the battery in the dead of winter. Not fun.
2) Major oil leak from the cam shaft at 20,000 miles. It drained nearly
all of the oil from the car.
3) Blown head gasket at 30,000 miles
4) Product recall (maybe fuel line, I don't remember).
5) Blown head gasket again at 67,000 miles
6) Transmission leaking oil from pump
7) Struts leaking oil at 50,000 miles

I have an extended warranty, which is supposed to cover # 5 and 6 (nearly $1000), but I'd rather have a car for which I didn't have to buy one. I think I'll buy a Honda next time. (As long as it's not made in the US)
