            Being the owners of a 1991 Hyundai it was with some trepidition that we considered purchasing a new model.  Due to the unprecedented warranty, 5 years bumper to bumper and 10 years on the engine/transmission, we felt it was worth a second look.  

I am happy to report that Hyundai is FINALLY producing a quality automobile at a very reasonable price.  The fit and finish is tight, the doors close smoothly and the entire body of the vehicle is far more solid than it's predecessors.  

We opted for the GS model with the power package, CD, AC and sunroof and still came in under $12,000. the car is peppy, brakes and handles well and compares favorably to the Accord (our other test vehicle).

For the price and the warranty you can't go wrong.  One thing I would caution prospective purchasers about is to thoroughly check out your local dealer. Be sure your dealer is reputable and that they have an adequate service department.  Good Luck<br><br>
