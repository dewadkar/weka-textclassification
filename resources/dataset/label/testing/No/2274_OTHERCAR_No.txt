            Working at a consumer information company, we had a lot of calls to answer about the Isuzu Amigo. What I have gathered through customer complaints is that the Amigo by Isuzu is a car that fits a very small group of people. Complaints registered from car doors falling off to windshield wipers missing. It seems to be that Isuzu Amigo's are a car that only screams &quot;caveat emptor!&quot;
    Amigo's are a very nice looking car with great mileage to the gallon. Like all Isuzu brands, the Amigo is roomy and comfortable. Its a great car to drive around the town in, but it can also take the harsh off road trips. Amigo's are a good looking, yet sturdy car.
    I would definetly recommend the Isuzu Amigo to any buyer looking for a long life and dependable car. Let me just mind you, keep your eyes pealed when buying Amigo's or any other Isuzu. You might be surprised at the parts and pieces you will end up missing.<br><br>
