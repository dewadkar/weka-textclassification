            Once, a long, long time ago (the 1980s) in a land far far away (the orient) a car company decided to design a pickup truck and then some. What they came up with was a very nice utility vehicle, they dubbed, the 4-Runner (Forerunner, get it?). it was a live axled pickup truck with a built in removable camper and two seats bolted to the back. And for this, it was amazing.  See, this was an SUV before the trend came in, and, because of it, it was really designed to rough it up with the best of them.

Now, over a decade and a half later, it's direct descendants still sell across the US, though they're a far cry from that original pickup truck.

The 4Runner fits across several slots in the automotive industry, the first is a lower end entry level SUV, and it streaches all the way up into the luxury SUV area, with prices ranging from about $24,000 to $44,000 for some limited models, this leaves plenty of room for an owner to choose exactly what he or she wants to spend.

The 4Runner has mellowed out considerably from the rough-and-ready halfbreed pickup truck it was born as, the live front axle has been replaced with independant front suspension for better road ride, the pickup truck frame and body are mostly gone, replaced with a frame and body specifically designed to balance comfort and strength. The rear suspension is now Coil-sprung, not leaf-sprung like the original, and the engines have (Thankfully) improved in power.

The base model engine of the 4Runner is a 4 cylender (22re based) engine, putting out an even 150 HP and 177 ft-lbs of torque. This would be good for a car, even some 4 door SUV's manage to make do quite well with powerplants like this, but for a 4,000+ lb, non-aerodynamic vehicle like the 4Runner, it just does not cut the mustard.

The V6 varients (3.4 liter) are much improved upon the older (3.0) models, which offered a measely 170 HP and rather low torque (both coming in at high RPMs), thankfully the 3.4 liter puts out a healthy 180 HP and 215 lb-ft of torque, though the HP still peaks at a very high RPM.

The interior is classic Toyota, very well thought out, very well built. A marine drill instructor could sit in one and not find a single thing wrong or out of place. (and anyone who's been in the service knows that a drill instructor could find a dust mite hiding underneath a gnat). 

The seats are VERY comfortable in all of the trim levels I have driven, and the sound system is excellent. Even the cupholders are decent!

The 5 speed transmission is very strong, and the 4 Speed automatic (AW4) has been referred to as Bulletproof, and I would have to agree with it.

The Transfer case (the bit that provides four wheel drive and low-range) is equally buff, and the low range gearing is the same ratio as the Jeep's, Land-Rovers, Etc. (This is good, folks)

The rear seats have alot of legroom, and cargo space was not lacking.

These plusses make a VERY attractive vehicle so far.
The minuses, while not many, caused me some concearn however,

One is, that it's simply not as capable in the off-road department as it's forefathers in the 1980's were. The independant front suspension, while on paper providing a simple solution to car-like ride and truck-like off-road performance, somehow wound up a bit stale. The ride, while nice, isn't as good as it's Live-axle competition in the Land-Rovers and Grand Cherokee's, and it's off-road performance also dims in light of the affore mentioned competition.

Now, by &quot;Not as capable&quot; as a land-rover or Jeep, this means that most users are going to be able to put their 4Runners through rocky trails that would make arnold schwartzenegger's hummer flinch (he wouldn't want to scratch that nice black paint, would he?), so it's no slouch in the off-road department, It's just that there are other vehicles in it's price range that do much, much better, even with the 4Runners optional electronic locking rear differential (Three cheers for Toyota for offering a locking diff stock!).

In the more extreme off-roading situations, the IFS (independant front suspension) becomes a liability; the IFS struts will drop only so much, so when one side reaches a large rock and goes up, it lifts the other wheel off the ground. while you still have the locking rear differential to provide power to at least one wheel with traction, it is very dangerous to leave a wheel in the air, one problem is that when you get over the rock and the center of gravity shifts, instead of the springs slowly eating it up as you go over, you physically slam down the side that was airborne (Air doesn't act well as a spring, unless confined in a bag). when you hit there's a good chance you're going to bounce, and that bounce can lead to all sorts of interesting problems. (want to bounce over a few inches closer to that 300 foot drop?)

It really disheartens me that toyota chose to go the IFS route on even it's land-cruisers now, as their live axle vehicles were truely great in the extreme off-road catagory. But, I suppose, like any marketting decision, comfort for the masses exceeds the needs (ok, desires) of the few. 

But like I said, unless you're planning a trip to Moab or the Rubicon, it's nothing that you will EVER notice.

The other problem with the 4Runner is the engine. the 4 Cylender engine, while reliable as a rock, is just too weak to consider using, unless you live in the backwoods where you'll never see an interstate.

The V6 engine, while more powerfull, still leaves something to be desired. Maybe I'm spoiled by the other SUV's with much improved power-to-weight ratio (Cherokee with the I6, Grand Cherokee with the V8, Explorer with the 4.0 SOHC 6 or the V8, any chevy with the 350 engine), but the 4Runner just feels slow to me. Maybe it's because I'm at 5,000 feet of elevation. I don't know.

Toyota has offered it's TRD (Toyota racing development) supercharger to the fray, providing about 240 HP (YES!), but at the cost of a few thousand dollars, and bringing another little quirk of the engine to light...

The Head Gaskets.  Ever since toyota released it's 3.0 liter truck engine, they've had a problem with the head gaskets going bad (these are the parts that keep oil and coolant from intermixing within the engine), and when they go bad, coolant seeps into the oil and combustion chambers, (cylenders) and Bad Things Happen (TM). The first sign of this is a loss of coolant and a wet &quot;Heavy&quot; exhaust. The second sign of this is the engine block cracking from relatively &quot;Cold&quot; coolant meeting the &quot;Hot&quot; cylender walls. Simple metal fatigue. While it's arguably rare (about 10% of 3.0 liters and about 5% of the redesigned 3.4 liters), it does happen, and if that block cracks, you are stranded. Not annoyed, but simply stranded. the engine will not function. &quot;It's dead, jim&quot;.

Toyota has several &quot;Silent Recalls&quot; out on this problem for both the 3.0 and the 3.4 liter engines (meaning that if it dies, toyota will replace the gaskets free of charge within 100,000 miles), and most dealerships will even ofer a loaner vehicle while they do the work (replacing a head gasket requires completely stripping down the engine.)

now, that being covered, the TRD supercharger puts alot more stress on the engine, and as such, alot more stress on those head gaskets...

Apart from this, other problems that I had noticed in the past (rear suspension's tendancy to sag after a few months of ownership) HAVE been correctly addressed and fixed, so newer 4Runners don't ride &quot;Nose Up&quot; as you may notice some other ones doing on the road. (No, it's not an optical illusion of the front fenders being higher than the rear, if you put a marble on the floor of the driver's seat, it will roll all the way back untill it bumps the tailgate. this is not normal. put a marble on one that doesn't have the sag problem and it will not have this tendancy.)


Now, other than those few little problems, the truck is quite solid, and like I said, the rest of the drivetrain is 100% bulletproof.

But for the price of the 4Runner, and what you get when you pay that price, I feel there Are better options out there now, as the legendary toyota Reliability just isn't there for the V6 engine. Test drive a few other trucks in the price range and see what you get with those. The Pathfinder, Rodeo (passport) and Mitsubishi Montero Sport, not to mention the Land-Rovers and the Jeeps (though some of them have some quality issues as well) are more than competitive with the 4Runner for quite a bit less (when comparing similer models).<br><br>
