<TEXT>
            I have a '95 Nissan Altima GXE.  I bought it a year ago and have put 25K miles on it to arrive at today's grand total of 66K miles.  The only work done on it has been routine maintenance, including the replacement of the upper and lower radiator hoses.
The only complaint I have about my car is the drivers seat causes my back to ache if I sit in it too long.  This was not something I realized when I test drove the car, but after my two hour trip home in my new car I was in pain.
When I called the dealership and talked to them, one of the salesmen said they had the same problem with their Altima.  He finally bought a new car as he had an hour commute each day to work.  My solution has been to try different seat adjustments and leaning up to keep my back stretched out while driving.
Hopefully, this will make others consider their comfort over the long haul.  Maybe an overnight test drive would have helped.<br><br>
