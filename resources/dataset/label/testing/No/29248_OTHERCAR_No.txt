            I have a '95 2-door Blazer LS.  It was the worst decision my husband and I ever made as far as cars, and I can't wait to get rid of it.  About two years after we first bought it, the entire electrical system went out while my daughter and I were driving it back to the Dealer to fix the problem of the windshield wipers completely crumping in heavy rain the week before.  Thankfully, we'd gotten close to the Dealer when it completely died, and I could walk to them while leaving my daughter on the side of the road with a totally dead car.  That was fixed.  It's also been in for &quot;recalls&quot; twice in the past 5 years.  This is the first car I've had that seems to have chronic problems.  It struggles BADLY trying to switch from first to second gear so there's no pick-up speed unless you've been driving for awhile (it's an automatic shift), it has SEVERE blind spots (you can barely see anyone to the right-rear or left-rear by checking side and rear-view mirrors if they're close behind you and actually have to open your window and look all around), the anti-lock brakes catch even when you're going slowly down a minor incline and brake softly at the bottom, the brakes alone are sluggish...I could go on.&lt;sigh&gt;  In my family, that car's called the &quot;deathmobile&quot;.  We bought it when my son-in-law said he thought it was a really neat car and a good one.  He realized, after driving it himself (and knowing of our problems with it), that he was wrong.  For me?...no more Blazers...I'm goin back to Nissan.    <br><br>
