            Well, Having driven one (it pays to be in the right place at the right time) and seen a few around...it's a nice enough car, but not worth the hype right now...(or the $5000 above MSRP that dealers are charging)

  The car drives pretty well...not fast by any measure of the imagination but you won't have any problems keeping up with traffic....and it's a nice firm ride (you can tell how short the wheelbase is when you hit potholes and such) and the seats are rather comfy, although i didn't get the chance to really test them on an hour long test drive...

The transmission shifted pretty smoothly...i would have liked to have tried but there was not one on the lot...

the visibility is not bad but &quot;van-like&quot; in the rear...and i could imagine that with some rear-seat passengers it could get almost impossible

Overall, I liked the car.  It's relatively roomy and has really people-friendly interior...and it's not terribly fast but it will keep up with the monster SUVs (just don't try to race anyone...you'll lose)

I wanted one for the style.  What caused me to leave the dealership was the &quot;premium&quot; that the dealers were asking...

I'll likely buy one in a few years after the hype has worn off (and the  v6 is available)

If you REALLY want one...go get it...But there is no history of depreciation on these vehicles and no way to not look like a jerk when you paid $25K for an $18K vehicle<br><br>
