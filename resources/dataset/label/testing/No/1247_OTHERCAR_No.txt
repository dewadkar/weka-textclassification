            I am a professional web designer not a professional photographer, but this camera is one of the better cameras I've used. I will explain what I feel are the negatives and positives. You can get the specs from the 
other opinions. 

I was looking for a camera that was versatile, easy to use, and took great pictures. I had previously owned the Nikon 950 version (around $750). I was very happy with that camera except for the issue of red eye. So I upgraded to the 990 version. 

<b>Negatives</b>
1) I found that compared to the 950 Nikon, this camera is a little more difficult to use. The menu options and navigating through the choices you want are not as obvious as the 950's menu. 
2) Another major issue is the red eye problems with taking pictures of people/animals with the Flash. Now both the 990 and the 950 have this problem I read in an article because the flash is too close to the 
optics/lens. Although it seems the problem is not as bad in this camera as compared to the 950. But for this kind of money this shouldn't be an issue. The solution may be to shut off the flash and buy a flash 
attachment, but I have yet to try it. Of course you can use Photo Editing software to fix the problem, but this isn't what you pay the big bucks for.
3) No case comes with the camera. The case is only $12 dollars on buy.com but for this kind of money Nikon should have thrown it in. The 950 version has a case.

<b>Positives</b>
1) The quality of the pictures is superb. At 3.34 megapixels this is what you are paying for. I was very happy with the picture quality in various lighting except of course when there is problems with the red eye.
2) It has the ability to record 40-second movies. This is a really great feature for the web. It creates a movie in *.mov format. So if you have QuickTime (or Windows Media Player) on your computer you can view 
the movies. It's as simple as changing a menu selection. These movies can eat up space on your CompactFlash card though about 1MB for every 10 secs of movie.
3) The camera has a lot of additional features and settings, which as a web designer and not a photographer, I haven't be able to use yet. But for basic functionality (point and click) it's fairly easy. The tough part is using and understanding the numerous manual settings.

Overall, I would recommend the camera but wait until the price comes down. I bought mine for $900 at mobshop.com. The problem with the red eye personally bothers me but if you're willing to overlook it or 
not take many pictures with the flash or are handy with photo editing software then this really isn't an issue for you.
