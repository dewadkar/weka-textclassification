            When my father first got this car, it had been wrecked and had about 120,000 miles on it.  He seemed to enjoy it, and after his last car, it was a dream mobile.  But over time, the car has gone down in value and reliability.  My first note to anyone looking at buying this car used is to take it to a mechanic and make sure that this car does not have any hidden problems associated with it.  Second note is, try and find a more reliable vehicle if at all possible.
Just going straight down typical things you look for in a car, the paint job and molding along it chips and falls off.  I have noticed this with many GM cars (especially my grandparents Buick Roadmaster)and so this is something that a person needs to look at.  The windows don't work half the time, and the safety belts for the front passenger and the back seat passengers do not function properly.  Although my father rigged them with an attempt for them to function properly, the front passenger seat belt sags horribly and because he has them set at a certain length in the back seat (because they do not go in and out varying on the person sitting in the car) you can choke to death or fall out if you are too small.  The seats are comfortable, which could be a good thing if it wasn't for the seat belts not working.
The electronics in the car is also not the best that it could be.  The radio rarely works and the brights on the car do not function properly.  As well, the interior lights located between the front seat and passenger seats and the back of the car do not operate at all.
One fault of my father's that was not GM's is the fact my dad never changed his timing belt.  On the way home from work, his timing belt went and ruined his whole engine.  He had to replace it and this engine runs horribly and gets about 12 to 14 miles to the gallon.  My suggestion is to make sure the timing belt has been replaced on this car, because it will go out when you least suspect it.
The car is definitely okay- especially if you need an SUV to junk out instead of simply use to drive around.  But if you need to use it to transport children or just simply rely on to go to work, try to find a better model or SUV.<br><br>
