            I have been an amateur 35mm photographer for 45 years and I found the DC-280 disappointing. Although technically this is a zoom camera, I usually think of &quot;zoom&quot; as involving some telephoto at the high end. The DC-280 only zooms optically to an equivalent of 60mm. This is more like the standard 50mm or 55mm view of a 35mm film camera. So what we have here is a digital camera that actually zooms only from moderate wide angle to normal angle. Of course you can triple the 60mm with the digital zoom, but at the expense of convenience and picture quality.

Another negative aspect of this camera is the LCD display. It is difficult to view in sunlight, even while shading the display, and requires constant adjustment of the brightness control. Also the viewing angle of the LCD is more restricted than that of another digital camera I own. Kodak placed the LCD right where your nose will hit it while using the viewfinder. I am constantly having to wipe smudges off the surface.

My other digital camera, an Olympus D340R, although not a zoom camera, produces images with much better mid-tones, color rendition and saturation. Even though it has less resolution, it blows up prints almost as well, and the LCD display is bright and crisp, even in the sun. Considering the huge difference in price, I don't think the Kodak was a good buy. Had I tried it out first, I would not have purchased it.  <br><br>
