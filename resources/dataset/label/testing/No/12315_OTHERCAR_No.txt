            A letter to Mitsubishi Motors

To Whom It May Concern:

In October 1999, I purchased a new 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS, from Colonial Mitsubishi, in Danbury, CT.  For the first 2 years I was extremely satisfied with the vehicle, and the service that I received from my dealership.
However, late last year I began having issues with Mitsubishi�s commitment to service, both at the dealership and corporate level, which is not so much an issue with the quality of the products, because the problems are relatively minor. I will explain.

In November 2001, my brakes began to develop a vibration and slight noise, and with nearly 30,000 miles on the vehicle I decided it was probably time for a brake job.  I phoned the dealership, and was told that it would cost nearly $300 for the service.  I opted instead to use another mechanic I trusted to check out the vehicle, who informed me that my pads were not completely worn out, but that he believed the rotors were warped or had some �hot spots�.  He told me that the rotors would be normally covered under the 3/36 warranty, and sent me back to the dealership.

After thoroughly checking my warranty, I went to Colonial Mitsubishi and asked about getting the rotors replaced or resurfaced under the warranty, and was informed that the rotors we only covered under warranty after the pads were replaced. Once again, I was offered a full brake job at a price nearly double the average local rate, due in part to �special pads� that my car needed which added to the price of the �brake special� offered. I declined, opting for a third party brake specialist.

Because I was told at the dealership that the rotors would be covered after a brake job had been done, I instructed that only the pads be replaced.  I was under the assumption, based on what I had been told at the dealership, that if the vibration problem still remained, the rotors would be fixed under warranty. After the pads had been replaced, the vibration problem had not been resolved, and I returned to the dealership.

After checking the brakes, the service representative informed me that there was no problem with the braking systems, and that the rotors were glazed and should have been resurfaced when the pads were replaced. They further informed me that the rotors were NOT covered under the warranty, and were part of normal maintenance. Lastly, the service manager explained that because non-Mitsubishi brake pads had been used, and that the brake repair had been done improperly because the �shims� had not been re-installed with the new pads, any warranty would not apply anyway.  They offered again to do a complete brake job, including resurfacing the rotors and genuine Mitsubishi pads. Once again, due to the price and to my belief that the Napa pads, (which were in near-new condition with only 400 miles on them), were superior in quality, I declined. I did however pay for replacement �shims� even though I later learned that no such shims were present on the OEM pads when replaced.

In frustration, I rechecked the warranty to verify that the rotors were indeed a covered item.  Per the wording in the warranty, only items specifically excluded from the 3/36 warranty policy were so excluded, and that if not specifically excluded the item would be covered. While �brake pads and linings� are excluded, brake rotors (which are neither a pad or lining) are not specifically excluded, which by default means they are covered.  

I then phoned Mitsubishi�s customer service number, expecting to get some assistance with what I perceived to be a difficult dealership.  Unfortunately, that is when my real disillusionment with Mitsubishi began. The woman that I spoke with was both rude and unconcerned with my satisfaction with your product.  She claimed to have checked with her supervisor to verify that rotors were not a covered item. Having read the warranty policy in full before calling, I asked her to read me the part from the warranty, which excluded the rotors, but she refused stating she did not have the warranty available. I explained to her what my copy of the warranty (which I DID have in front of me) said, and was informed that, �if the dealership decided it�s not covered, then it�s not covered�. I attempted to explain all that had already occurred, but to no avail. 

I was ready to give up. My frustration had reached a boiling point, and I decided it wasn�t worth the effort to pursue this, even though I was ready to write letters to everyone from consumer reports to my congressman. It probably would have ended there, if not for my most recent service visit.

I had been having problems with the hatchback of the eclipse, in that the hydraulic struts that assist in lifting the hatch had lost their ability to do so. Lifting the hatch was becoming increasingly difficult, often requiring two hands. Also, I would pop the hatch from inside the car, get out and try to lift it, but the hatch had not fully released due to the struts being unable to lift the hatch enough to clear the latch.. 

One day, I was a few blocks away from Colonial Mitsubishi, and decided to drop by the to have them take a quick look at it, figuring they would probably need to order the parts.  I was told they weren�t able to even look at it, and that I would need to make an appointment. I did so, returning several days later, where after 2 minutes they confirmed that the parts needed to be ordered and sent me off.  I made an appointment, and had the struts replaced on my third visit a week later, which were covered fully under the warranty. 

The next few times I opened the hatchback, however, I noticed that it did not seem noticeably easier to lift. In the few days following, I have had several occasions where the same problems I experienced prior to the repair were occurring, including the hatch not fully releasing using the interior lever.  

I phoned the dealership, to see if there was some adjustment that could be made, or if perhaps the struts were incorrect or defective. I was told that those were the only ones for the car and that the factory spoiler was to blame. They said there wasn�t anything that could be done if replacing them didn�t fix the problem (even though I had problem free operation during the first 2 years). They said they�d look at it the next time I was in for service (which will be never), but that I would probably just have to live with it.

So, I find myself writing this letter, which I am sending not just to Mitsubishi, but to every consumer protection agency I can think of. With 2� years and 35,500 miles on my vehicle, I am no longer a happy Eclipse owner. I have lost my respect for Mitsubishi and your dedication to your customer, and plan to do all that I am able to let the rest of the world know why.  

I doubt that there is much that Mitsubishi can do to change my feelings at this point, though getting the problems repaired (properly and under warranty) would be a start. Rest assured that as I write my car payment check to Mitsubishi each coming month I will be thinking about my next car�a Toyota, Honda, or maybe even a US make.  

The thrill is gone, and your commitment to service and customer satisfaction is what killed and buried it.  As a service provider myself, I realized a long time ago that every problem with a product is an opportunity to let your company�s commitment to service shine.  People hope for quality, but they expect service.  When a company fails to support their products by providing the service to back them up, any successes will be short lived.  There are simply too many choices to accept less.
Sincerely and respectfully yours,

DROOLINDOG
