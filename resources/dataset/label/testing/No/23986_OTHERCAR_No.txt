            After reading all the reviews about what a great car the new 93 850GLT was going to be, I promptly ran down to the local dealer and put a deposit on one out of the first shipment. Six weeks later I was cruising in my dream car.  Three weeks later it was in for repair.  Five years later (I know I'm a glutton for punishment) and over 200 repairs the 100K warrantee was over.  A month after the warranty ran out it needed $3K more in repairs.  It was time to trade it in, but to my dismay, I could not find a dealership that wanted it.  Trade-in estimates ranged from $3K to $5K on $30K new cars.  The Volvo dealer wouldn't even take it in trade on another V70 for two reasons; they said I had suffered enough and new ones weren't any better than the one I had.<br><br>
