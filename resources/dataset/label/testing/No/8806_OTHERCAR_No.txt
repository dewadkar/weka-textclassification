            For Honda-philes who wait for the release of the company's SE Accord every 3-4 years, the moment of truth is at hand.  The Accord SE (or specifically Special Edition, of which Honda makes particular note in its ads) is a 2000 model, but a &quot;special&quot; edition of this almost-perfect automobile it is not.

Background:  The Accord SE models are released every 3-4 years to mark the end of a particular run in the design of a current Accord.  That is to say, when the Accord is expected to be redesigned, the SE is released.  So in this instance, since the SE is a 2000 model, we expect to see a redesigned Accord beginning with the 2001 model year.  Whether it is to run-down supplies and facilities of excess materials, or to present their &quot;perfected&quot; car from which 2-3 years of real-life testing results (the latter being the reason I agree with least), the release of the Accord SE model is anticipated by many Honda enthusiasts.

As such, we were excited and anxious about this 2000 Accord SE.  But, we were DISAPPOINTED.

In essence, Accord SE models are Accord LX models with a few extras thrown-in to make it special.  Of those extra features, we have come to expect at a minimum the sunroof and exclusive color.  And Honda has failed on both of those points.  The sunroof is not an option in the new SE, and the color looks too similar to the &quot;mica&quot; cashmere that's available in both LX and EX models.

While we appreciate the standard ABS in the SE, that's a feature that can be had in the top-line EX and even LX for a nominal cost.  Anti-lock brakes is not a feature that will sell an SE to a Honda enthusiast.

Honda buyers who prefer top-of-the-line everything should look at buying the Accord EX instead of the SE.  Similarly, buyers who need all the comforts of a fully-loaded car, but can do without the sunroof, and premium stereo should look at buying an Accord LX.  For those who nitpick, the only exterior difference between a 2000 SE and a 2000 EX is the SE does not have body-matched sills (trim below the doors that runs between front and rear wheel wells) and the &quot;special&quot; alloy wheels.

The Accord SE is a waste of money and time.  When we bought our 99 Accord LX in anticipation of a spectacular 2000 Accord SE, we expected a color that would turn heads --similar to the 97 Accord SE in &quot;Black Currant Pearl.&quot;

Lowdown:  Accord SE is an Accord LX (as it usually is) but this year lacks a sunroof (with which it usually came equipped), and does not come in a color that sets it apart enough to be called &quot;Special Edition.&quot;

Recommendation:  If you want top-of-the-line, buy an EX.  We gave the Accord SE 3 stars for being as bulletproof as an Accord will be, but couldn't give it 4 or 5 stars because it simply is NOT an SE.
