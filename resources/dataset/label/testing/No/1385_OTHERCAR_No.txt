            I purchased my 1995 VW Golf CL really thinking that I was moving up (I had owned a 1988 VW Fox prior - the most boxy-looking automobile on the road).  Having driven VWs all my life, I knew that you wouldn't be able to kill the engine on these things, and that the body would fall apart first.

Well, I was certainly right!  Here are the list of "niggly things" that have plagued me (not to mention my pocketbook) since my purchase 2 years ago:

*The automatic door locks broke the minute it got cold.  If you live in a cold climate (Canada) do not take this car through the car wash - the lock mechanism is in the handle, and freezes with the slightest bit of condensation.  A few mornings I managed to get a back door open and crawl over the seats to start my car.

*The fuel milage (compared to my Fox) has been disappointing.  I have taken it to the shop for numerous tune-ups, and it doesn't seem to improve.

*Normal wear and tear repairs in the last year:  shocks, struts, muffler (there are 2), breaks - they all went at once.

*the electrical/starting system is less than stellar and extremely cranky in the cold.  This is because the starting mechanisms and relay switches are positioned directly behind the grille and the wind blows directly on them. If you use a block heater, you MUST plug in this vehicle in order to be certain it will start.

Positive things:

* For a small car, it handles very well and is fun to drive.
* The seats are very comfortable, making long trips easier.
* The built-in alarm system is a great deterrent to car thieves.
* The 6 speaker sound system is quite stellar - but the cassette player doesn't do it justice.
