            The circumstances that I came about getting the Grand Am weren't the best; my Chevy Cavalier went through the lemon law (it was in the shop 42 times in the first year).  Rather than take GM to court, we decided to settle for the purchase price of the car towards another car at the same dealer.  They only carried Chevys and Pontiac, so that is why I chose the Grand Am.

I was 19 when I got the car and really loved it.  It was quick (V-6, versus my four cylinder Cavalier), looked nice, and very comfortable--especially the seats.  I thought I would own it until it fell apart.  Well, I wouldn't have to wait too long before it started to fall apart.  After about six months, everything started to rattle and squeak.  Also the seat belt latch broke, and the knobs for the air control fell off.  Then the breaks wore through faster than any car I have ever had before and since, (and I definitely do not ride the breaks).  Before we owned our current cars (Nissan and Honda), I thought I would own a Grand Am forever, but now that I see that there are much better cars made out there I would never go back to GM.

I would really love to have the pride and own an American, but every time I have had one I have had trouble.  My current car has had no problems in the first three years, and there are still no rattles.  So maybe if you would like to lease a Grand Am for two years it might be a good idea, but don't expect it to last much longer than that.<br><br>
