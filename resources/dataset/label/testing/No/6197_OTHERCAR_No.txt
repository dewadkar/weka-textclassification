            I was all excited about getting a digital camera to take some great pics of family and general shooting purposes.  I was not planning on using it for any professional reasons, so I thought a 2 megapixel would be fine for me.  I did some research and decided I liked the Fuji 2800 and the Kodak DX4900.  When I got to the store I talked to the salesman who said he loved his Kodak.  When I compared the two, the Kodak just appealed more because it was a 4 megapixel and only $20 more than the 2 megapixel I was looking at.  I also trusted the name "Kodak" since they have been in the camera industry for quite some time.  So it was settled, I was buying the Kodak.

After my purchase, I was so excited and ready to try it out.  So I played all night taking pics of everybody around me and everything in sight!  When I got home I downloaded the software (which ended up being a pain!).  I then transferred my images to the computer and began reviewing them.  I noticed that some of the pics were fuzzy or blurred and wondered why since I was only a few feet away from the subject.  This concerned me, but I just thought I had not had all my settings adjusted correctly since this was my first night to use it.  The next day I took a few more pics of family and they turned out pretty good (but I did not use any zoom).  The next day we attended the state fair and I was very excited about catching some great pics of all of us on the rides.  Boy was I ever disappointed!  Not only that, but the stupid battery when out in the middle of the fair.  I couldn't believe it!  I had just bought the camera 2 days ago and we had only taken about 20 pics total!  I was very upset because as I was trying to take photos the camera would shut off.  Well when we got home, I decided to transfer the pics to the computer to see what great shots I had captured.  This is where the deciding factor of returning the camera came in.  The photos were very crappy.  I couldn't even make out that it was me in the photo on several.  My husband was only about 10 ft. away when he took some of these.  The problem was he had zoomed in to get me on the ride before it started.  It just looked like a big blur.  Several others were the same way.  We were standing outside one of those funhouse things when my neice walked out, and we took a pic of her, again this was just a blur.  

I returned the camera the next day.  What good is a camera if you can't see the people you are taking pics of?  I decided on the Fuji 2800 because it has a 6x optical zoom compared to the Kodak's 2x.  Another issue I had with the Kodak is the easy share dock is sold separate which will add another $80 to your bill.  I was overall very disappointed with the Kodak.
