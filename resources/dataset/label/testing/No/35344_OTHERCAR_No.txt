            The biggest mistake I ever made was being lured in by the good looks of the Chrysler Town and Country (our son quickly
nicknamed it the "Town and Crappy"). We had been satisfied
with our 1991 Toyota Previa and needed a second minivan when
Chrysler came out with the redesigned 1996 Town and Country.
Much sleeker than the Previa, and with almost as much room
and more power, the T&C caught our fancy during a test drive. But the dealer didn't have the model we wanted, so I flew out of state to purchase the one we did.

The car DIED on the ride home, and that was just the start of this nightmare. The problem had to do with "electronic settings," and though it took the dealer almost two weeks to get and install a replacement part, we were offered a loaner car for ONE day -- and that came only after repeated calls to Detroit! 

The car was at the dealership more than it was in our driveway. And the dealership was nasty! We figured they were ticked off at their lot in life -- having to sell and repair the worst-made cars on the market. When we'd take the car in, we'd find ourselves sitting with scads of other equally aggravated T&C owners. 

Things continued to get worse. The sucker would die on us for no apparent reason. Air conditioning settings stopped working. The CD player would skip and, simultaneously, all the lights on the panels would go off. In less than a year, fluids began leaking. The windshield wipers would suddenly and mysteriously turn themselves on, then stop. We decided the car was possessed! Christine II!

Not one Chrysler, Dodge, or Plymouth dealer that we
approached would buy back this disaster, at any price! They
literally laughed at us! Less than two years after we purchased it, we managed to persuade a Toyota dealer to take it in trade (plus $16,000) on a Toyota Sienna. I'm sure it's being used as a planter by now. 

We considered getting folks together to file a class action suit against Chrysler. Chrysler knew this car was a lemon, but refused to take responsibility for their incompetence. Instead, they supposedly made improvements in later models.
But, judging from the number of "for sale" ads in the classifieds for all years of the Town and Country, I'd say things haven't changed much.  They can keep all their bells, whistles, and cupholders -- I'll take a Previa with 200,000 miles over a new Chrysler minivan any day.  

If I could give a product NO stars, this would get it. Try finding a satisfied owner of a 1996 Town and Country. Betcha ya can't!
