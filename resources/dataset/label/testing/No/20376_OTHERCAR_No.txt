                    I recently purchased a tribute lx from a local dealer and I have to say it was the best purchase so far that I could have ever made. The suv handles comparably to a sports car just higher up. It has plenty of power and I have not even got on it hard yet, but the passing power is incredible for a six cylinder. I purchased the white with abs,tow and luxury package. I have to say that the sunroof alone is worth the extra amount. Though I must say that there are several small problems though. First I am going to recieve a recall notice for a possible faulty o-ring fuel gasket. This on top of one that the dealer checked for a possible problem with cruise control. The other negatives are that the seats are not the most comfortable but they are not that bad. Another is that the shifter is on the column not floor{automatic}.The shifter is in the way of radio controls, again though not to bad. 
       Now lets get to the positives,again the power is great,the handling is great,rear seat space is comfortable and plentiful,Roof rack is a nice little xtra dont know if I will use it but nice to have. Radio controls are big and easy to understand and use,sound quality is clear and crisp. The rear window opening seperately is great and really comes in handy.The tribute is an eye catcher I see people looking at it all the time and it makes me feel good about my purchase.The only way now to buy one though is to get a price from one of the internet auto dealers like autobytel or cars direct.com. They quote a price that is reasonable compared to dealers asking sticker or above. They will get you the price and then get you in touch with a local dealer that hopefully will honor that price i found that some will and some wont only if you order and wait for it. I researched hard and long before my purchase. 
        I researched ford ,Toyota,nissan,honda drove them all they could not stand up to the power and handling of the tribute as well as price for what you get. If this has helped please rate my opinion and i will know i am helping by writing this review. If you have any questions you can email me at jk61268@aol.com. I  strongly stand by this opinion and am glad I made the decision i did. Zoom zoom zoom
        I recently took my tribute on the beach to try the four wheel drive out worked wonderfully had to deflate the tires but drove through the sand as well as any other 4wd{well almost}I had no problems getting through the sand and turned fine I can say it passed my test with flying colors.The only thing I had to do was buy a compressor that plugged into the truck power supply I would be afraid to drive the deflated tires for even 50 feet under low pressure.This suv is alot of fun.Dont know how often I will take it on the beach hear in NJ but I am sure I will again.



Update 6/02 love the trib hate the problems.Some are very minor like seat wont go back all the way.But there is a problem with the trib stalling going down inclines.I have read of many others with the same problem happens intermittently.I had it in  a while ago but had no fix for the problem.I guess first year vehicle danger.If you buy one make sure warranty is good.
