            I believe the expression is... &quot;When iMotors.com tries to sell you lemons, you make lots of lemonade for the rental car agency.&quot; That is what brought me to this car. Unfortunately, saying &quot;I think I can, I think I can,&quot; won't let you keep up on the freeway. And so begins my sad tale�

A long time ago, in a far away land... Ok, it was about 4 months ago and on the internet... I ran into iMotors.com. They promised me a &quot;like new&quot; used car and so the saga began. After two bad cars from them (one was even a different model from that mentioned on the CARFAX VIN report!) I am still in a rental. This time, I got the 2000 Chevrolet (formerly GEO) Metro.

<b>Room</b> - Actually, this car reminds me of the clown car in the circus (that is a good thing, though). That car was a tiny car, but somehow a lot of clowns somehow were able to squeeze themselves inside. The same is true here. It leaves at least half a foot on both sides of even the &quot;compact car&quot; parking spaces. At the same time, even a basketball player (ok, maybe Spud Webb more than Wilt Chamberlain) will have plenty of headroom. Also, you can even put real people in the back seats! The trunk will hold 1-2 large suitcases or about 100 kilos of cocaine (if you are with the DEA, forget I said that).

<b>Styling</b> - This is not the worst car you can drive, but you should have other things going for you if you expect to cruise the strip in this car. Lack of power windows and a real window defogger are just a few of the things you will feel are missing if you last vehicle had more than two wheels. As a previous reviewer stated, the body is not terribly strong and the bumpers are filled with Styrofoam. (�Packed with packing peanuts, the Metro is really satisfying!�)

<b>Engine</b> - In arial combat, as well as California freeways, there are no points for second place. This is not good for the Metro. I think I would have preferred an open floorboard so I could move the car along with my feet like Fred Flintstone.  That would have probably made it go faster. I cannot reliably drive even at the 65 MPH speed limit without the car whining and screaming. In the 0-60 test, this car clocks in at an �if you are lucky.� It may be a �neighborhood� car, but I have a 5-mile commute, 2 miles of which are on the freeway, and I keep thinking I am taking my life into my hands every time.

<b>Mileage</b> - I have only driven this car for about a tank and a half, but so far, I get about 25 mpg, not even close to the 60 or so that some people talk about. Sure, it is better than the 3 inches per gallon that a cruise ship gets, but still not a total gas miser in these high priced gas times.

<b>Features</b> - As noted above, lack of �power� items (steering, windows, seats, defroster) is somewhat of a concern. It is not a big deal for me to unroll a window or turn the car, but for someone smaller or weaker, it might be an issue. Make sure you try all these things and are comfortable with them before you buy.

<b>Price</b> - If you really want a �new� car and have little money, this might be one of your only choices. That in itself might be a benefit. On the other hand, a used car of another type would likely make you much happier. As a rental, the $5 savings over the next larger car might not be a big deal unless you are paying for it yourself. In that case, especially if you are renting long term, like me, this might be worth considering.

<b>Bottom line</b> - If you don�t need power or styling, or even features, but just need to spend as little as possible, this might be the car for you. If you can see beyond the lowest price, I urge you to be more discriminating.<br><br>
