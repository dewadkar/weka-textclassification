            Here's my history.. you be the judge:

Bought vehicle with 19000 miles

Replaced alternator immediately (factory warranty)

Replaced fuel pump ($500 range). Replacement has lifetime warranty, why didn't the original?

Headlights started intermittently going off. Replaced headlight switch ($200 range I think)

Cooling system started gurgling due to Dex-Cool coolant which GMC started using in 1995/96 vehicles. Good luck getting someone at GMC to admit that there is a problem with the Dex-Cool and their 4.3 liter aluminin block.
Had Dex-Cool chemically flushed and replaced with green Prestone. The gurgling cleared up within a week. Not sure of cost but it was at least another $100

Had problem with front wheel drive axle - replacement in the $500 range. Also, when Thomas GMC of Coon Rapids, Mn
did the work, they nicked an ABS wheel speed sensor wire + crossthreaded 2 lug nuts. I had to debug the ABS problem, then dealer fixed ABS gratus.

About a year ago, the windshield wipers started to become intermittent. I never fixed this since I was always able to get them going by banging on the wiper assembly under the hood.

Two weeks ago, a vacuum leak noise started when depressing the brake pedal + brakes started to feel mushy. Thomas GMC said master cyclinder was bad. Thomas replaced master cyclinder ($500+) then told me that brakes worked but still had vacuum leak. They said master cyclinder problem caused the brake booster to go out and they would give me a deal and replace the booster for $400. This was when I said enough is enough and told them to do now more work. This was on Friday. On Saturday I went out a dumped the Jimmy for a 2000 Toyota 4Runner.

Other problem, nuisances:

Goodyear was never able to balance the tires for a smooth ride. I don't think Jimmys are meant to be driven over 45 MPH.

On last trip to dealership (the brake eposide), I was told the the power steering pump was leaking at the shaft, the oil lines were leaking at the crimps, and that the stationary CV joints where drying up. These problems can be fixed by the new owner.
