            The Honda Accord was the only other car I looked at when I was shopping to replace my trusty 1985 Camry because my old Camry was such an incredibly dependable well built car. I should have bought the Accord.

The Camry I purchased is an LE, with the power windows and door locks, but NOT the power seats. It had a simple am/fm/cassette stereo (the standard equipment).  I have since replaced it with a am/fm/CD player. I purchased this car NEW in 1997.

I really don't have a lot of good things to say about this model year Camry. It's been a big disappointment. Some of it is mechanical but most is that the car has not held up. Here are the reasons I don't like this car.

I do want the readers to know that with the exception of ONE time that I allowed about 8-9k miles without an oil change, the car has been maintained according to the maintenance schedule in the owner's manual. 

Here are some of the problems/complaints I have had, and this is NOT all inclusive.

1) Initially after purchase the car was returned several times to the dealer for strut tower problems (I have no idea what that is but the car sounded like it was going to fall apart when I went over the smallest bumps).  I was told I wouldn't have the problem again, but it has recently reappeared.

2) 1-1/2 yrs ago, Worn engine seals, sludge on the engine. The owners manual says the oil should be changed every 6k miles. I went a couple of thousand miles past that and I paid over $500 to clean the engine. (note: other than this ONE time, I have changed the oil regularly at 3,000 miles). The dealership was 'great' and they replaced the seals under warranty by 'adjusting' the claim somehow to show it should be a warranty item. I was very grateful...but guess what I just got in the mail last week (6/02)? I received a letter from Toyota saying that a small number of Camry owners have been experiencing a engine sludge problem and that they will pay for repairs provided the owner can show the car has been maintained properly. I have now learned to keep ALL maintenance receipts. So evidently this was NOT my fault. I wonder now if the dealership knew about this and that's why they were so willing to replace the engine seals at no cost to me.

3) 2 yrs ago, the paint was peeling on the bumper. It was repainted under warranty and I just had to have it redone.

4) The switch on the dome light broke (Dec, 2000) $75

5) The rear cup holders broke (not repaired due to cost, about $60), 

6) Power door lock problems. When I lock the doors with the driver's side lock and then go to open them again, the doors won't reopen using the door lock. This is especially annoying when you've locked the doors and then need to unlock them again to get in the back door. The doors have to be unlocked manually or via the key in the front door.  I have learned to live with that because it was going to cost over $300 to fix.

7) Another unrelated power door lock problem occurred and the part and labor was also about $300. 

8) During the past month the engine light went on and I had to spend $500 to replace the EGR Valve, modulator and VSV. I was told that while this was not absolutely critical these parts monitor and regulate the oxygen into the engine. If not replaced, the engine could at some point possibly stall while driving. Sounds critical to me, but being a guy that is clueless about this kind of thing I'm not sure if I was being 'taken for a drive.' (pun intended)

9) The trunk lock has been replaced twice over the past two years, and

10) The console storage cover latch broken. (spring broke so cover won't latch. Also too expensive to fix; $60. I can live with the cover not tight.

Another thing that really bothers me is the rear window defroster. The rear window defroster only covers the center of the window. The defroster 'wires' in my old Camry covered and defrosted the entire windshield. Most other cars I have looked at also cover the entire windshield. The upscale Avalon also appears to defrost the entire rear window. Why did Toyota do this on the Camry?

Speaking of defrosting, the front defroster (defogger?) only works when the air conditioner is on. There is a control setting to have a combination air vent/and window defroster on that does not use the air conditioner, but after almost 5 years it has never defogged the windows.

I wondered if I just got a lemon. But then I ran into someone at work with the same model year Camry that I have and he has experienced many of the same complaints and problems with his car that I had. So it makes me wonder if any of the other reviewers have had similar problems now that more time has passed since they wrote their reviews.

--beginning of update--
So, what IS there about this car that's good? The Camry for its size class has a lot of leg room. The rear seat fits 3 adults ok, and no problems with three kids. I have also always been impressed by the amount of trunk space in this car. 

The dashboard controls are VERY well placed and easy to read. The air conditioner also works very well and has been very reliable (especially important since I moved to Florida a few years ago.)

How's gas mileage? Fair. I drive mostly interstate, but I-4 is usually like a parking lot, so I guess you can consider that the same as local roads ;-)  I usually range about 24mpg.  When I do long distance driving I have occasionally gotten about 26-27 mpg. Gas mileage may be better for others than for myself because I use the air conditioner all the time which decreases mileage.

The steering is stiff and I like that! It makes me feel like I have more control while driving. The car corners well, too. I feel safe in this car.

One of the the drawbacks on Epinions is that when consumers write reviews the products are fairly new and readers of the reviews don't have the benefit of long term use. That's not necessarily the fault of the reviewers since models change so frequently on so many items that by the time people REALLY get to see if something is reliable, it's been replaced several times by other models. That's one of the good things about reviewing older cars. People will still be buying them so the advice can be valuable.

I'm hoping that this will be helpful to some people who are seeking reviews on used cars for advice.

I will not look at buying another Camry in the future.

<b> Update 6/12/03 </b> I have had very little luck selling this car at below the "Blue Book Value."  It turns out (according to two different dealers and some other people I spoke to) that the market is flooded with Camrys which then really hurts the resale value. You may want to consider this if you're buying a new one (and you're lucky if buying a used one because the prices should be pretty good!)
