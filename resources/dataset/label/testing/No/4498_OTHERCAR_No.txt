            Ok, now if you have read about me then I think that you will think that I am not going to be so good with the review because I am only 13. But I think ownership of four years and countless rides I think I can give you quite a review.

Features

These are some things I like about this van. It has a nice air conditioning system that will keep you cool in the summer and warm in the winter no matter what seat you are seating in. The LX model which I have also comes with very soft cloth seats that I can sleep on any time I want to. There is also a nice and smooth quiet ride. There is also an electric antenna that goes up by itself too.

My Story

This is more of a What Should I Know review. I am going to start off complaining so feel free to exit my review at any time. There has been so many problems with my van I don't think I can count them all.

Stereo

Yes the stereo took a crap. Some how the radio went bad and we had to get it fixed which means taking the radio out (big pain). But I must say that the system is really good except the woofer which is very quiet (we replaced it).

Wheels And Tires

Yes the wheels and tires went bad also. At first we have started off with a sort of rut metal scraping sound in big brake stops and wide turns. Turns out that something went wrong and it was with some shocks or something. Had to get that fixed too.

The Quality

Now we are talking about a van here. Something that is strong and durable, hey, not this one! My mom broke off the antenna when going out of the garage by hitting the garage door with it. It broke partially then my dad just ripped it off. Had to get that thing replaced. Also the door handle. My dad accidentally opened it up hard and hit it on the side of the house and the handle just flew off. Now you would think our van is pretty gimped but I'm not done yet!

Why The Buy

Don't ask. It was cheap and the overall look was beautiful. Maybe it was just our used version that turned me off.

The Good

The good about owning this vehicle is that it is quieter than the Dodge Caravan and drives plenty better. The seats are also the best out there and the stereo is quiet but impressive.

The Bad

There are so many problems and problems. If you are going to own one of these for God sakes take care of it or you will be spending lots of money for repairs just like my family.

The Bottom Line

Your average clunker. If I were you I would go for a different van such as the Honda Oddossey.
