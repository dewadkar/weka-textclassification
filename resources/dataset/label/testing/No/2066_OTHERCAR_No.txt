            I had high hopes for this camera because it uses a CCD sensor to pick up images.  However, the picture quality is terrible!  To get an idea of what the pictures turn out like, take a picture and turn the contrast and color saturation up so high that details of the picture disappear.  That's what happens.  Dark pictures don't turn out, and the flash makes everything a too bright.  Only the central focal point of the picture turns out well.  I also went through the first pair of batteries in the first day- after about 30 pictures!  Rediculous!  Now, despite these major, major shortcomings, the camera isn't bad for it's $130 price tag.  It works extremely well as a web cam (probably the best web cam ever made), and is very small and lightweight.  Pictures taken on a cloudy day outside usually turn out great.  Anything else is terrible.  I'm returning mine to trade up to an Agfa CL34 which has a better light sensor and a higher quality CCD.  If this isn't any better, I'm going to have to sacrifice the webcam capability to get Fuji's 1400 Zoom- for $230, that's the best deal in town on an extremely high quality camera.<br><br>
