            The Forester has comfortable ride, even for long trips. The handling is good and acceleration is adequate. Cargo room is generous. Leg room in the rear seat is tight.

At 26,000 miles I had to replace the tires (Yokahama) and front and rear brakes. Total cost was about $750. Since I lease vehicles to avoid having costly repairs, this was a major disappointment. The only good new is that the new tires provide much better traction. 

When the heater is set in the floor position, way too much air comes out of the upper vents. The dealer said this is normal. The result is cold feet and hot everything else. 

Any beverage in the cupholder takes a direct hit from the vent. The heater controls are totally obscured by a beverage in the cup holder. 

The paint is fading, especially below the rear wiper. It may rub out, but a modern car should not have to be waxed regularly to maintain its finish. 

The moon roof is very noisy when open at speeds above about 25 MPH, so I rarely use it. There is no tinting on the cargo area glass, so the car gets very hot in the summer.
