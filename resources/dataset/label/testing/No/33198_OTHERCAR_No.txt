            My wife and I have been looking for a new family car for several months. Not yet ready for a true family sedan, I was looking for a sedan with a nice ride, roomy and stylish. And, I didn't want to spend a fortune (shooting for around $30K). 

My experience with the Catera is based on a test drive, so I can't say much about the long-term reliability. My drive was for about 30 minutes and logged about 20 during the drive. Other cars were compared were the Maxima 20th Anniversary Sports Edition (our choice for purchase), I30 (nearly identical to the Maxima, but cost more), Bonneville, 300M and BMW 325i.

The Catera was the last car, out of the 6, we test drove. I never considered the Catera as I thought it would be out of my price range. However, Cadillac had a special offer on leasing that made the payments reasonable. My expectations were that a car in this price range, and a Cadillac to boot, would be comparable to the other 5 cars we had driven.

First Impression
We, my wife and I, found the Catera to have rather sharp looks (others may hate it). It fit the bill from a sporty sedan and a roomy interior. The Catera had lots of toys to play with, including OnStar, traction control, etc.  

Ride
Compared to the others, the Catera rode rough! The salesman said this was due to the German Engineering, hogwash as the 325i was smoother. The Catera definitely showed my why it's "The Car the Zigs" as cornering had too much roll and we "zigged" and "zagged" in turns. Engine vibration was very noticeable on acceleration and traveling down the highway. Way too much road noise for a car in this price range. 

Roominess
Headroom was decent, even with the sunroof. Front legroom was good. Rear seating, while decent legroom felt hard. The rear headrest was tipped to far forward, making it uncomfortable (I'd remove them if I owned the car). The car offered more room than the 325i (god does the BMW have a small backseat area). Headroom in the back was about average, better than the Bonneville.

Performance
Again, comparing to similar priced cars, the Catera was sluggish and seemed to strain to get off the line. Engine noise was much louder than the other models. At highway speeds the car lacked enough "oomph" to get into passing speed.  At 200 horsepower, the Catera is, in my opinion, underpowered. 

Value
At the $30K range, all the cars are similar. The Catera though was sticker priced $2K more than a comparably equipped Infinity I30. Cadillac though discounts more than Infinity so actual difference was about $1K. Still, to me the Cadillac should be priced lower than the I30.

Lasting Impression
As my wife and I drove home, we talked about the car. There wasn't anything really bad about the Catera. But then, compared to the other cars we drove there wasn't a lot of good things to be said for it either. The Catera was a middle of the road type of car, with nothing really setting it ahead in the pack. With the troubled history of this car one would think Cadillac would do something to make this car sell itself. All it did was sold us on another model.
