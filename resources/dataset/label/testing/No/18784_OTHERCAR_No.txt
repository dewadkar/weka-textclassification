            I drove a 1997 Sephia as a company car that had been purchased new. Considering the low cost, it ran fairly well and was economical. You have to overlook some shortcomings (loud engine, rough ride, etc.) in an $8000 car, but some points must be made.

The scary braking is enough for me to urge anyone considering this car to beware. Unless this particular car was an exception, the Sephia locks up and slides horribly on any wet road surface, even at remarkably low speeds. Saving a few bucks isn't worth my life -- I would NOT buy this model without anti-lock brakes, which are an expensive option!

Reliability didn't seem very good, either. There were no major problems -- just a lot of small annoying glitches. the automatic transmission shifter locked up and needed to be freed through an access hole. The back-up lights and truck lock work intermittently. The alternator died well before its time. Also, oil consumption is heavy -- about 1400 miles per quart. Modern autos shouldn't need any oil between oil changes.

The plusses: fairly comfortable and roomy for a small car(and I'm 6' 4&quot;), reasonable gas mileage (32 mpg average), great A/C, good standard radio and versatile with the folding rear seats.

Unless you get an extremely low price, I'd look further or check KIA's newer models. I would expect improvements (a la Hyundai).<br><br>
