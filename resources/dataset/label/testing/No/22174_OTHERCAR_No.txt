            I bought my 1998 VW Golf new in 1999. I absolutely love the way it drives and looks;but it has really been nothing but grief. 

First problem I noted was the squealing brakes, that was in the first week after I bought it. Took it to 3 dealerships before they could tell me that it was due to glazing on the drums and really could not be fixed. Fine, okay, I can live with a little noise. 

Second, water in the back hatch after 5 months of ownership. Took 3 dealerships again to tell me that the bulb in my taillight was for some reason melting the tailight lens. Okay, replace bulb and taillight lens, no more problem, right? Approximately 6 months later, more water inside the trunk! Now I have exceeded the 24,000 mile mark of the warranty. VW of America tells me too bad, so sad, pay for the replacement taillight lens yourself. Also, dealership has no idea why the lens is getting melted. They replace the lens and change to a lower wattage bulb. Just to let you know, I have had to come to live with the water in my car because it still leaks! The problem remains unresolved.

Third, (the bigee) my alarm/keyless entry system (which the whole car seems to be based upon) starts going nuts. Horn won't stop honking unless battery is disconnected. Bring it to dealership and they say nothing is wrong. Problem stops for about 6 months, then comes back with a vengeance! Doors start locking/unlocking themselves, horn is going off constantly, hatchback is popping open. Take it to second dealership (barely able to get it there) they hook it to computer but still don't know what the problem is, but at least this time they can't deny the possessed vehicle sitting in their garage. They propose changing the alarm control unit to see if that would fix it. Well sort of. Car stops going nuts but keyless entry remote will not work. They have no idea why not, but at least I have my car back. VW of America again says that they are not responsible even though problem first occurred while under warranty. My alarm/door locks work fine for about a year, until yesterday when the alarm starts wigging out again. I don't know what to do!

Last and least, the one of the interior lights has stopped working, replaced bulb, but to no avail.

Basically, as much as I love VWs and particularly love the way my car handles and looks, I would not advise anyone to consider buying at 1998 Golf, they have serious problems. And because of the level of nonconcern that I received from VW of America, I would not recommend any newer VW. You'd do better to get yourself a vintage VW where at least if something goes wrong you have a chance of understanding it. Now I have a leaky, psycho car : (

Note: I've been reading of several other people with problems with the alarm system. If you have problems, file a report with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), that's the only way we have a chance of getting our problems addressed since VW is choosing to ignore them.
