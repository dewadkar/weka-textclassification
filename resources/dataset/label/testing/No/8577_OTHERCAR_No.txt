            I bought a 1994 Grand Am for $5000 with 80K from a young man last October and I have all heck with this car since I got it.  The previous owner told me that the only problem that he had was a few fuses kept blowing but that was it.  Well....that is not all that kept blowing.  First off this car is accident prone I'd swear to it.  I got the sun roof shattered and cost me $700 to fix.  Then, I had the radio stolen out which was a $400 radio.  Not to mention no one seems to notice that the wheels  on these cars are aluminum alloy wheels that cost about $500 from the dealership a piece(not including the tire itself, of course)!  How I know this is b/c a wheel was stolen off my car (they tried to get all 4 but there were wheel locks on the others!) But then things started to go with the car itself.  

It started with the tail lights and parking lights going out so we switched out the headlight switch and it worked after 3 switches, but not for long.  We were leaving for work one morning and went to turn the ignition key and the starter would not disengage.  I smelled something burning inside of the steering column and thought that my car was going to blow up.  We unhooked the battery (to disengage the starter)but by that time the starter, ignition switch, and their wires were burned up.  Then we replaced all of those parts and a new switch, thinking that we may have caused a short when we put the new one on.  Not to mention that anytime that you have to fix or change something it is a royal pain b/c you see the manufacturers of this particular vehicle make it to where it is too difficult to fix yourself b/c you have to do stupid things, like unhook the air bag and remove the whole steering column in order to change a stupid switch, that you have to take it to a auto shop to have anything done!  Needless to say we still do it ourselves!

Well, it has now been about 2 months since the episode with the burning steering wheel and now two days ago my alternator went dead.  Now just fyi if you have to change the alternator or the belt on this car, you have to lift the engine and remove one of the motor mounts.  A 30 minute job to change this out ended in a 4 hour saga.  The next day we went to go get another headlight switched (the 4th one now) and my AC just decided to quit working.  Now it wouldn't be that bad had my windows decided to work.  One of the motors is out in the passenger side and the drivers side window is all messed up. All of the braces in the door are broken, which has caused the window to be all scratched up.  Therefore we keep it up, b/c if we put it down it won't go back up.  This did not go well with the A/C gone!!

Let's see..what else.  The struts and strut mounts have been replaced twice and I must now do it again due to a weird popping noise when I turn my wheel.  The breaks when checked look fine, but when breaking I get some really weird noises.  The cruise control hasn't worked since the first week that I got the car.  Both seats are not electric but are movable, and the latches and springs are broken underneath (and me being 5'0" doesn't help me).  The whole A/C will only blow out of the front vents (no bottom vents and no defrost vents).  Sometimes the ABS light likes to come on when it feels like it.  All of the gauges vibrate around so it is hard to tell what they actually read.  I think that this much work to a car the first nine months that you get it is crazy.  Trust me when I say that these cars are not worth the cost of keeping them.
