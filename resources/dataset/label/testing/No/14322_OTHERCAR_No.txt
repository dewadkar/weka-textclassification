            We just bought this car last year (2002), there is only 40,000km on it, and it has just been terible. All 4 tires have alredy been replaced, 2 blew up, 2 warped. The dealer is a @#&^#$^#, they refuse to hold up theyre warranty coverage. The engine light comes on every week, and tends to stay for a few days, mostly when the gas tank becomes low. Handling is nothing great, just standard, anything over 50kmh in a turn and you slide like mad, the suspension is so bad i'm afraid my neck will snap when I hit a pot hole or a speed bump. 

The dealer has been just terible, everytime we take the car in they mess something up, last time they aligned the wheels wrong. The breaks are alwready wearing off, and I just don't feel safe driving this car, the construction seems flimsy and gives the impresion it will crumple on impact. 

The interior design is pretty nice, but until there is something seriously wrong you won't know it until it's too late, the car only shows speed, gas, temperature. Sound system is impressive, sounds very well for a stock system. 

There is very little you can do to make this car look good from behind, it's just ugly. Although the front is nice. Under the hood the engine is just so ugly, wires and things everywhere, completly unorganized, looks terible.
