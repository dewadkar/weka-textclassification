            My son owns a 1991 Dodge Monaco.  This car was bought new by his Grandfather, then when he passed away it was given to my sons Father.  A year and a half ago my sons Father died at a very early age of  42.  With my son about to graduate from high school and attend college, and now without a Father to help support him through college, I talked my son into keeping his Fathers Dodge Monaco.

After $3,000, in a year and a half, this appears to have been a HUGE mistake.  To me it made sense to put even $3,000 into a car that had 55,000 original miles and no rust.  But the problems continue to exist.  All the power window controllers had to be replaced and one of the power mirrors.  The air conditioner needs to be replaced but that we do not plan on doing. 

My sons Father had an accident with the car that he never fixed so went spent $1,000 on body work.  No one, of course had any used parts for this car and we had to buy new.  The tune up cost a lot of money with everything the auto shop needed to replace. 

The Dodge dealer that worked on several of the mechanical issues allowed my son to keep fixing various mechanical problems and then one of the head mechanics finally told me to get rid of the car.  He said this car will be nothing but trouble, that they all were. 

The car was leaking oil so we took the car in and had the head gasket replaced.  One month later the car was still leaking oil and then had to have all the seals replaced.  Within one week of all the seals being replaced the car was pouring out oil.  The mechanic took the car apart again and he had to replace the seals again, one of the seals split right in half.  He told me he used top of the line seals the first time and again the second time but now he used something else to help seal the seal.  

This mechanic told me also that I should get rid of the car.  I have spoken with many mechanics and was told by all of them that the aluminium engine will always cause us trouble.  The mechanic that repaired the seals and gasket told me I need to have the cam or something replaced and that this is a VERY expensive job, mostly because the part is very expensive.  

The car is also leaking power steering fluid.  We have also replaced the thermostat on the car, all 4 tires, new shocks and new brakes.  All of this has been done to a car that now only has 65,000 miles on it and all within a year and a half.  It is not that we are taking the car to bad mechanics, the car has been seen by numerous mechanics including several from the Dodge dealership.  Oh yeah I almost forgot, the mechanic also told me that the car needs a new radiator.

I am do amazed that a car with such few miles could have so many problems.  This is so upsetting to me and my son.  Now without the financial help of his Dad, not to mention the loss of his Dad and putting all this money into this car and now all the mechanics say to get rid of this car.  We will never get the $3,000 out of the car that we put into it plus we have to dish out more money to buy another car. 

If anyone has any mechanical suggestions on the vehicle please let me know.
