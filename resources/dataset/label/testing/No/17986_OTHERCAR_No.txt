            I actually bought the next step up in Mustek digital video camera, the DV4000.  Like another reviewer stated, the DV4000 died on me within the first 5 minutes of testing it!  I plugged it in to charge the proprietary battery for about 1.5 hours (the instructions do not mention anything about how long it takes to charge), and then turned it on still connected to AC power (which is something the instructions do say you can do).  I was able to record about 20 seconds of video and take two test pictures before the camera died, and now it won't turn back on.  After initially charging the battery, the camera (and battery) was extremely warm to the point of being uncomfortable to hold for more than a few seconds.  I do not think that is normal.  

Both the DV3000 and DV4000 seem like they would be great little gadgets to own and use, and you just will not believe how absolutely tiny it is until it is in your hand -- it really is the approximate size of a stack of 6 credit cards!  The DV4000 has additional features of being used as a MP3 player and digital voice recorder, and those would have been nice features to have in addition to still and video photography.  Having dealt with inferior Mustek products in the past (handheld scanners), I was hoping their quality control had improved.  Unfortunately, it has not.  

I have a Gateway SV-120 coming in the next few days, which is a similar camera, but less features (no webcam, MP3, or digital voice record).  The Gateway model is also only a 2 megapixel camera, but the Mustek is just a 2mp camera with hardware enhancements to bump it up to 3 or 4 megapixels.  The Gateway model also has an internal flash, which makes it a lot more useable indoors.  

The Mustek version of this formfactor just does not seem ready for primetime.  I have sent mine back to HSN after receiving no response from Mustek Tech Support on this problem.  I will not buy another Mustek product.
