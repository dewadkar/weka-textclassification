            I wanted a cheap car to drive to work.  I didn't really care about fuel mileage, just so I wouldn't put the mileage on my weekend convertible (which was a bought during a moment of insanity).  It was cheap ($4500) and already had near 93K on it.

I liked the styling the most.  I have the SE with the Aero kit and the 3.4 multi-valve V6.  It was also loaded with every gadget, from the HUD display, power seats to the Power Sunroof.  It also handled pretty well and was comfortable to drive on the highway.

But the reliability and durability of this car is poor.  The tranny whines like crazy (people have been telling to rebuild it for over a year now) but hasn't broken down yet.  The struts are going, the driver seat is in poor condition (I can feel the bottom coils when I go over a bump), I have seen a little smoke coming from the steering wheel column and I have fixed the Alternator and Battery twice (once was under warranty).  The brakes are very poor performers (even though they are 4-wheel discs with ABS) and GM is currently under a class action lawsuit due to the design of the brakes.  Also the engine, even though it has 200 hp is weak when mated to the 4 sp automatic.

However, for the price I paid, I can't really complain.  However, I will not be keeping this car for long and I really am weary of GM's quality problems (as much as Daimler-Chrysler). <br><br>
