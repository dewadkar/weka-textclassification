            I received a refurbished Kodak DC215 free of charge from an organization to help other organizations post web photos.  It looked like a nice, heavy, quality brand new camera and came in unopened packaging with its components.  I didn't know it was refurbished until I looked at the bottom and noticed a REFURBISHED sticker on it.  A red flag went up when I saw this and left me "ah haaaa-ing" as to why it didn't cost anything.  I was then actually expecting problems after noticing it wasn't brand new.

When I checked the Kodak website for this camera, it had been "discontinued" according to their website.  Hmmmm.....I wonder why?  I've seen a lot of them on ebay that have broken battery compartment doors and other problems.  Was it coincidence?

This camera EATS batteries!  I purchased a package of brand new heavy duty AAs, took about 5 or 6 photos (with the LCD screen on) and the batteries were completely drained!  The lens cannot retract when the batteries die while using the camera (it is supposed to retract when you shut the camera off).  This increases your chance of a scratched lens since the lens cover will not go on unless the lens is retracted (you can't do it manually).  I heard that the LCD screen is what sucks up most of the batteries' life.

Another problem that I noticed was it's ability to save photos to the picture card.  I took 5 photos and the camera appeared to save them.  When I got home to upload the photos, the pictures were not there...even though the camera counter indicated that 5 photos had been taken.  My advice on this point is to always use the REVIEW feature to make sure you see that the photos were saved before you leave to upload them.

One more thing I noticed with my camera (not sure about anyone else's) but the battery tray that slides into the camera is plastic and the batteries don't fit in snuggly.  They wobble around which leads me to believe that they may not be getting good contact.

Still another problem was with the LCD screen.  If you take photos outdoors, often you cannot see the image in the LCD screen.  You have to use the regular viewfinder or take indoor photos only.

Because of the fact that this model of Kodak camera was discontinued, I believe that it was done so because of the problems it seems to have.  I haven't checked into a repair estimate and would assume that it would probably be wiser and more cost effective to purchase a new camera.  Especially since there are important plastic parts that can break.
