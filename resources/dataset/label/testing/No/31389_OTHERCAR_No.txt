            The Oldsmobile Alero gives value for those who are probably looking for compacts.  The great things about it is that their radio is large enough so that the controls are easy enough to operate without taking your eyes off the road, even though there aren't steering wheel mounted radio controls. The rear defogger is fast which allows clear visibility on a misty day.  

However, it doesn't mean it's perfect, since Oldsmobile just announced their discontinuation of the nameplate in the coming years, last year.  Hence, it will only lead to hefty depreciation which is a problem since it hasn't really established a reputation to the market as something that is recommendable.

Comfort is rather on the short coming since the air conditioning is weak on hot days and it doesn't really keep up with the hot air outside or sunlight. In addition, the ccontrols for the fan speed and vent controls are rather stiff, plus when the AC is on it's hard to tell whether it's on or not since it's easily washed out by sunlight.  Then the rear seat's cushion is too low for long distance comfort and for those who are 5'8" or above the headliner rubs against the head and with the power roof it could get worse.  Then there's the driver's seat, although it has a height adjuster, the adjustment doesn't really accommodate decent thigh support for those who need more of it.  And the lumbar support, which is underneath the seat, is awkward to reach and the support doesn't really alleviate my back pains since I have to keep adjusting it every 15-20 minutes.

The engine itself is rather noisy since I have a 4-cylinder and it growls when driven in a rural road and expressway.  The reliability is rather low by modern standards, since the indicators such as "Low Tire Pressure" is constantly on, even though I have my tires inspected and repumped.  The chimes that keep repeating itself for the "Low Tire Pressure" indicator is annoying and it doesn't really occur.

For the worksmanship, it's subpar compared to the foreign nameplates.  The passenger's airbag cover is not really aligned on the front console and the paint isn't really all that smooth.

As a result to used car buyers, excercise caution when buying North American nameplates.  Remember, when cars are on the expensive side within the same class, they're usually more reliable and they retain a larger percent for the resale value.
