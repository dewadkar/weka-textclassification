            My brother in-law purchased a fully loaded SLT a couple months back.  When he told me this, I was very excited to see it and take a test drive.  Maybe I let my expectations get a little too high because when I sat in the truck, I was very disappointed.  The general layout of all the controls and instrumentation was not placed too ergonomically.  Maybe Dodge should take some pointers from the Japanese automakers.  

Well off we go, and boy does this bad boy have A LOT of power.  I believe it is a 5.9L V8 and it does have a lot of torque.  Throughout the test drive I was looking for things to like about the truck besides the power, but couldn't really find anything.  The ride is quite harsh even for a SUV.  The steering seemed very sluggish and unresponsive.  

The seats are descent but I couldn't imagine riding in them for over an hour.  The truck itself is very big but the interior space does not do it justice.  Not enough cabin room for a truck of this magnitude.  

My brother in-law has told me that he is not happy at all with the Durango.  The gas mileage he is getting is somewhere between 11-13mpg.  There is a couple of rattles in the interior that started showing itself recently and he also agrees that the seats do not have enough support.   

Overall, the only thing that impressed me about the Durango was the power and torque of the V8.  I was and still am very disappointed on the Durangos ride and comfort.  If I had the money for a full size SUV, I would stick with one of the GM models.
