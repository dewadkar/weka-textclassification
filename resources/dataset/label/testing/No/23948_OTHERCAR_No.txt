            This is digital camera from Oregon Scientific isn't too great I have never heard from this brand name anyways. But before I tell you its no good I will Point its cons and Pros. 

Pros: Small: its very small the thickness of two credit cards put together no not as small as they want you to think but its seriously thin. 

Easy to use: Its seriously easy to use and to delete pictures and browse through its limited menus. with a few clicks of a button and you successfully deleted all the pictures or just some. 

Battery: It has good battery life, lasts pretty long. and heres the best part you don't ever have to buy a baterries for it, its a rechargeable built in battery that recharges via the USB cable(its included) 

Cons: Blurry Images: Ok off the bat this cameras quality of pictures are not all that good, its either a hit or miss, some pictures come out pretty decent and others leave you upset. And Im talking about pictures in its highest resolution. 

No Flash / Light Source: This camera has no flash, so this makes it a pain to take decent pictures at night or inside a building, without extreme lighting. It will refuse to take a picture unless there is enough light, it will beep every time there is not enough light, and will not take the picture. This feature is good because you will have a lot of messed up pictures. You will need a spot light basically to provide any good pictures indoor. Even when it lets you because you have enough light they come out dark and on top of the blurriness equals trash! 

Overall this camera isn't all that good. I got it via the Marlboro offer, so it didn't cost me much. But I would say do not buy this camera look else where!
