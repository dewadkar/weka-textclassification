            I am renting Dodge Stratus because one of our vehicles is in the shop.  I have to say that I'm completely torn on whether or not I like it.  The ES that I'm driving does have a very sporty appearance and I like the white gauges.  The only thing I don't like about the outside appearance is the hubcaps.  They look terrible.  I haven't done a lot of homework on this car so I don't know whether or not the car even comes with aluminum wheels or what the wheels look like if they do.

Inside the car, I don't feel like it's really that comfortable.  I absolutely hate the tilt-wheel mechanism.  I think it's cheap and a pain. The seats are very weird feeling.  I don't know what to think of them really.  They have good lower- and upper-back support, but somewhere in the middle there isn't any.  What's that about?

The legroom is very tight.  I'm 6'0&quot; and don't have many problems with cars but the Stratus is small.  I commute 120 miles a day and I'm really not comfortable.  I've been in worse cars, (my wife's old Geo Storm) but not many.  It's pretty cramped.

I don't like the controls for the stereo because they are little hard to reach, especially when you have to keep your eyes on the road.  You have to eject the tape in order to listen to the radio and learning how to set the presets for FM2 takes awhile to figure out.  The dome light turns off when you shut the door not when you turn the key.

The trunk looks like it's pretty big.  The door opens nice and wide but you have to do all the work.  If you pop the trunk from inside, the only thing that happens is the latch releases.  You have to reach up over the expanse of the trunk opening to open and close it.  I was being a little lazy today and only opened the trunk halfway.  What resulted is that my wife ended up smacking her head on the door.

Also, the button to release the rear seat-back is a little out of the way. You have to stretch across to the middle in order to get this to work. Come on Daimler-Chrysler, is it too much to ask for two buttons?  I mean this car is above $15K.  Spend a little.

The actual drive experience of the car is pretty good.  It's got plenty of power.  The only thing I don't like about this is that whenever I set the cruise control, the car tends to want to jump up a couple miles per hour. I'll set it for 65 and the car will cruise at 67 or 68.  It seems to be a little high maintenance.  Also, to cancel the cruise control you have to practically slam on the brakes.  Most cars you just lightly tap but not the Stratus.

I know that it has a cancel button on the steering wheel, but who remembers that.  I have driven no other car by any other manufacturer that has that feature.  I usually end up trying to turn cruise on using that button anyway.

I'm not at all impressed with the Air Conditioning.  It takes forever to cool the car down.  Our dog (Grimm, the Great Dane) rides to and from work with us and he has done nothing but pant to and from work.  Our car has a couple vents in the back seat, but even so it takes a lot to cool that car down.

As far as my overall impression of the car, I'm torn.  There's things I like on it, but there's enough that I don't like that I wouldn't buy one. The car is OK, not something you cruise town in and say, &quot;Hey, look at what I just bought.&quot;  People could care less.

To get this car to look cool would take new wheels and tires (preferably low-profile) and tint.  This probably wouldn't look good on the maroon one I'm driving though.<br><br>
