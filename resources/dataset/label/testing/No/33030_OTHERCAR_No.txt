            I bought this as a new car in 1995 and I don't think that I had 6 months over the time that I owned it without having to go to the shop.  At first, it was problems with the electrical system.  Then, my breaks went out at 20,000 mi (and I didn't drive it that hard).  I had a problem (which turned out to be the distributor cap) that took the service dept (all Dodge dealerships) about 5 days to figure out, then another 3 days to fix.  I had a full warranty, but this doesn't cover much.  Especially the fact that one might need transportation while the vehicle was in the shop!!!  I was impressed with the roominess, but that was about it.
It had a very hard and noisy acceleration (I had the V6 automatic) and got ticketed many times (or pulled over) due to the build of the car.  (I have a Honda Accord now and haven't been pulled over since).
I bought the extended warranty about 2.5 years after I originally purchased it (w/0$ deductible) for about $1000.  I would guess that I got the $1000 back and plus with service trips and problems with the car in the first 8 months of the extended warranty.
I also visited many Dodge dealerships and service depts and had very poor treatment at all of them (especially the one I purchased the car at).
Because of this car, I would NEVER buy a Dodge again and am really having doubts about any Chrysler product.  I am also now very wary about purchasing new models in their first year.
Other problems that my friends had with their '95 Avengers:
-Transmission dead at about 10,000 mi
-Engine caught on fire in a parking lot
-Many electrical problems
-Alarm will randomly go off for no reason
-Very high insurance rates.<br><br>
