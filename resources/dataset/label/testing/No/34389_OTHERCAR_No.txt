            <b>Comfort and Amenities:</b>
Very comfortable but seats could be better designed, only missing item - built in digital compass

<b>Performance and Handling:</b>
Average performance despite 200 hp 3.0 L engine (heavy car - 3,800 lbs).
You tend to slide around in the seats during sharp cornering. Brakes are very smooth.

<b>Safety:</b>
Large blind spots around car due to thick 'A' & 'C' pillars

<b>General Comments:</b>
We just bought a fully loaded one with 18,000 miles for $20 K (inclusive of all taxes & fees - which would put the price of the car alone to about $18,575) from Hennesey Cadillac in Atlanta, GA in mid July 2000. The dealer had started at a total 'drive out' price of $20,800.

When negotiating the price of a used car, this is the way to do it - focus on the total price to drive it out not just the price of the car.
We had already been approved for a 8.5% loan from PeopleFirst.com

Fair value for the car with mileage & options was anywhere from $22 K (www.edmunds.com) to $23 K (www.kbb.com).

The dealer even installed new tires on it since the prev ones were 'scalloped'. It came off a lease and the prev owner did not fix an alignment problem (quite noticeable while driving) and it ended up spoiling all 4 tires which would have cost $500 to replace at Firestone.

The dealer could make this swap by downgrading the wheels from alloy to regular which they told us and got our permission for.

We had to pick up the tab for the 4 wheel alignment ($60 @ NTB).

The major problems with it are:

* there seems to be no good place to put your elbows during long drives - it would really reduce arm fatigue if the center console(?) was higher up and the elbow rests on the doors were wider so you could drive with both hands on the wheel with your elbows supported

* the cup holders take up all the space in the middle and there is none left for your tapes/cds, etc.

* the central location for all the window switches is ok but it would be nicer to have the switches on the front doors as well (currently there are no window switches on the front doors which is not intuitive)

* the remote keyless systems is totally silent with no audio feedback so you are never certain you locked the car unless you saw the lights blink

* black exterior & black leather interior without much window tinting makes for a blistering hot car if left out in the sun -
we plan to get max window tinting and are using a reflective sunshade

* low power to weight ratio:
the 3.0 L 200 hp engine has decent power but not for a 3,800 lb car.
This car would greatly benefit with a more powerful engine - maybe with 250 hp or more and more low end torque also

* no built in compass

* poor lumbar support (its manual and we have set it to the max)

* ugly and bulky turn lever

* the stereo does not switch off automatically when the ignition is turned off (we just found out that it does switch off when the driver door closes but it still drains the battery until then)

* 2 buttons for the horn - bad design - you should be able to hit it anywhere in the middle just like in other lower priced sedans (e.g., 95 Mitsubishi Galant which also has dual airbags)

* every time we switch off the ignition, we have to manually switch off the stereo and unplug our radar detector (which is quite annoying) since the power to the cig lighter does not cut off at all (this is an advertised feature in the owner's manual!)

* the headrests are almost impossible to move (slide down) and after struggling with them for some time we have given up and decided to take it to the dealer since the back seat headrests obstruct your rear view

* the pillars (A and C pillars?) are quite thick and create large blind spots towards the left front and right rear of the driver

* the key seems to get stuck in the ignition when trying to take it out - this happens about 40 - 50% of the time and you have to restart the car and then turn it off to get it out which is annoying

* the steering wheel also seems to block some of the gauges (e.g., oil, battery) and you have to move your head to see them (bad design)

* the turn signal indicators are located at either end of the dash which takes a little getting used to since we were accustomed to seeing the signals much closer to each other and in the center of the dash

* we had to stick on 3" circular mirrors on the side mirrors for better visibility around the car (about $5 for a pair)

* the rear view mirror should be wider since the car has larger blind spots (the front & rear pillars should also be much thinner)

* you will tend to slide around a little in your seat during a tight turn - they should cradle you better

* ALL cars should move their ignition from the steering column to the dash (e.g., Chevy Malibu, Pontiac Bonneville) or the center console (e.g., Saab) - once you get used to the new location you realize its much better ergonomically than wrapping your arm around the wheel everytime

* poor gas mileage - about 17-18 mpg average in mixed driving which is what some SUVs get! This should be at least 20 mpg in a sedan.

* better armrests & head rests please!

We love:

* 200 watt BOSE sound system with 8 speakers
* tape/CD combo
* radio antenna printed on rear glass instead of having to be a retractable or fixed one
* 6-way dual power seats
* memory settings for driver seat & mirrors
* radio/cd controls on steering wheel
* rear air ducts
* dual climate control
* traction control
* outside temp monitor
* automatic dimming rear view mirror
* express up & down on ALL 4 windows
* runs on regular gas (just discovered that premium is recommended in the owners manual!)
* awesome brakes - silky smooth
* moonroof closes automatically which the key is taken out of the ignition - every luxury car should have this feature and also extend it to all 4 windows (i.e., having them close automatically when the key is taken out (maybe with a manual override)

Its our first caddy (maybe even the last) and we only plan to keep it for 1-2 years before the bumper to bumper warranty ends since its rated VERY unreliable by Consumer Reports.

<b> Update (mid Aug 2000): </b>

* We got the max tinting allowed for $200

* The alignment problem returned, NTB swapped the tires around and reduced the problem somewhat for no charge but its still a little annoying

* The air bag light came on and it had to be taken to the dealer to get fixed - some wiring had to be replaced and it was covered under manuf. warranty

* A few days later the key started getting stuck in the ignition! Luckily we were able to reproduce this problem after some trying at the dealership - the shift was apparently not locking in place when Parked, this was also covered under warranty

* When I tried to replace the temp dealer tag with the perm one, the top left screw bracket(?) came off entirely. I'm talking about the plastic clip that the screw goes into - I've screwed the plate in the top right & bottom left spots for now. I'm too tired making 25 mile round trips to the dealer - I'll wait for a few more weeks for a couple of other things to break and get them all fixed in one go!

* Now the engine hesitates for almost a second when you press the gas from a stop which is annoying (and embarassing when minivans out accelerate your 'luxury' car!).

<b> Update (early Sep 2000): </b>

* There is a strange noise that comes from the right front area inside the car (near the speaker and side mirror) - you can only hear it when the car is moving but its not regular (almost sounds like a small short in a circuit) just a little static/hiss for 1-2 secs at a go. Hope I can reproduce this at the dealership!

* The door locks have decided to start acting funny - everytime I use the remote/keyless to unlock, all 4 doors unlock and the driver's side locks back after 1-2 secs! Then if I lock & unlock, everything is fine ...

This would be the 4th non-routine/repair trip in 8 weeks!

Next time i'll heed consumer reports advice to avoid the VERY unreliable cars! I've learnt my lesson.

* The service dept is closed on weekends so you have to get there before 6pm on a workday! Does caddy think its owners don't have full time jobs?

<b> Update (mid Sep 2000): </b>

* the right front speaker (tweeter) was replaced - it was shorting and producing that strange noise

* the driver's door lock was also replaced

* the air bag light came on for a 2nd time during the ride to the dealership! (great timing!) this was also fixed

* turns out the alignment was not done properly and the dealership charges $220 for a 4 wheel alignment! that's 3 to 4 TIMES the average market price here ($60 - 75). talk about ripping off your customers...
I'm going to take it back to NTB in a few weeks to find out why they could not fix it the first time around. I'd hate to have to pay 2 times for the same repair problem.

<b> Update (late Oct 2000): </b>

* got alignment fixed for the 3rd time in 3 months! luckily we did not have to pay for it (NTB gets full marks for customer service - there is no warranty on alignments)

I'm very concerned about the alignment - it gets thrown off so easily, i think its a manufacturing defect. I should not have to pay to get this fixed so often. I have never had this problem with any of the other cars I've owned and I'm not driving this one any differently.

<b> Update (early Dec 2000): </b>

The hissing/crackling noise has returned from the front right speaker.
The driver's door does not close properly when the temp falls below freezing! I had to borrow my wife's car to go to work. When it had thawed out by afternoon, it started working fine. I'll be taking it back again.

<b> Update (late Apr 2001): </b>

The front brake pads & rotors had to be replaced.
The total cost was $450 @ Midas!
The rotors alone were $185 each.
They had the best prices of Firestone & Goodyear.
It seemed outrageously expensive.
Apparently the brake wear sensors are like fuses - they only go off once before they have to be replaced @ $10 each!

Total spent on non-routine repairs = $560 in first year of ownership.
