            My parents bought me a used '90 Calais when I was in school back in 1993 after I had crashed my car in a winter black ice accident. I thought it was great. It had a sun roof and the doors were very heavy. The car would warn me if I didn't shut the blinkers off. It was a nice little car. Right around 1995, my radiator was leaking fluid. I took it to a mechanic who told me to take it to the dealer. The dealer told me that the head gasket had cracked. So for about $1000 I fixed it. I was traveling overseas after I graduated in 1995 and returned home in 1996. When my brother drove my car, he told me that it would stall out. And when I got back, I witnessed this happen a couple of times. So we took it to the mechanics--a cracked head problem again. Suffice it to say that at about 150,000 miles we got rid of this car which also had problem with rust spots. <br><br>
