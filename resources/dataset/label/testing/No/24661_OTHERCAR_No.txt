            I find myself amused, looking at the first line of Saturn's 'Story':  "Saturn was created with one simple idea: to put people first."  This has been far from my experience.  

I purchased a new 2003 ION 2 in early December and it has since been in for repairs 5 times, 4 of which for the same problem (front turn signal malfunction).  In addition it has had water damage from a leaking seal and a malfunctioning brake light.

This didn't bother me so much as the response I received from Sharon Combs, the General Manager for my division when I asked for a new vehicle since this one obviously isn't performing within reasonable satisfaction.  She informed me with very little tact that I had to be patient, that 'these things take time,' and that 'Saturn isn't in the business of buying back cars.'  She acted as though this was the first time that the vehicle had been in for repairs.  Her condescending tone and manner was of little help as well.  In addition, she felt very comfortable telling me things like &#147I understand how you feel&#148 and &#147I want to make you satisfied,&#148 yet everything that followed those phrases left me feeling complete unimportant to them.  I&#146ve since been in contact with her superior, their electrical engineer who was nothing more than a Public Relations man and couldn't tell me anything substantial, and my case has been review twice by their board for a buyback.  I've received nothing but snide comments and utter refusal.  Just to be clear, I'm not stating anything in particular about my local dealership.  I am commenting about the Saturn corporation.  True, it's possible that as far as I've dealt is nothing more than the Texas area, but you should still ask yourself if your area is really that different.

Now my car has been in for the fourth and final time for repairs.  They now diagnose the problem as electrical (RF) noise related to my cell phone charger.  Their solution?  Buy a new charger.  No need to fix the car, let&#146s just try and get around the problem.  To test this theory, I got in another Ion and plugged in my charger and sure enough, one of the head lamps stopped working.  Saturn claims that it is not their responsibility to accommodate accessories used in the power point of a vehicle and that they have only had problems with generic phone chargers.  They have not registered this defect with the Safety Review Board of the Department of Transportation as they are legal required, nor are they even acknowledging this as a defect.  In addition, cell phone chargers are not the only cause for these symptoms.  Anything that produces any small amount of RF noise will produce the same effects.  One example would be an arcing spark plug (not too uncommon) even from the vehicle next to you. I have already experienced problems when my phone charger and phone where no where around, so this obviously can not be the only cause.

Recently I noticed another Ion in a parking lot and sought out the owner.  When I found her, I inquired if she had experienced similar problems to my own.  She said that she had, but had not as of yet taken the vehicle in for repairs.  I asked if it seemed to be related to her cell phone charger and she said that it was.  The difference with her, however, is that she was using a Nokia brand charger, not generic.

Now that I've gotten all of that out of my system, I'm prepared to move on to the remaining aspects of my vehicle.  First, let's talk about the interior.  The seats are not terrible, but I've definitely been in more comfortable chairs.  The cloth is just plain repulsive if you end up with the mix-matched colors, but fairly nice if you get the leather or nearly solid cloth.  It seems to have a bit more room than previous models but is still a little cramped in the back.  The trunk is just plain huge for a car of this size.  Last, the instrument cluster is in the center of the dash.  They said it was for easier visibility, but I find that it's rather annoying going from this car to on with the cluster behind the wheel.  It's not necessarily a bad location, but I don't really see the point.

It handles pretty well, though it didn't blow me away as the dealer claimed it would.  He said that it was designed to take corners much better than their previous models, but it seem about the same to me.  Also, it has a bigger engine that the S series, which was supposed to give it more power, but it seems to me that it was increased just enough to handle the increased weight.

That being said, I encourage anyone who already owns an Ion to test their vehicle for this defect.  If you experience problems, take your car in immediately.  In addition, contact the Department of Transportation at 1-800-424-9393 immediately since Saturn has failed to report this problem and is unwilling to inform their customers of the defect.  If you have not purchased this vehicle as of yet, I encourage you to look elsewhere.  The features found in this vehicle are not one of a kind.  In fact, I think you'll find several vehicles out there that are quite similar.  I have had three problems with mine, 1 of which is definitely not an isolated incident.  I just feel that if you're going to pay $15,000 - $20,000 you should feel you made a good purchase, and with this vehicle you won't.
