            The relative popularity of the RAV4 is curious.  It's attributes include nimble handling, smooth transmission, and optional AWD, but it's not particularly roomy.  What's the point of an SUV if it's not roomy and has questionable off-road ability.  The engine is pitifully weak, often revving to over 4,000 rpms for adequate power, especially with the auto.  

The interior fittings are definitely not appropriate for its price.  The only pieces of soft touch plastic are the steering wheel, shifter and the interior door grab handles.  EVERYTHING else is cheap plastic!  The fabric on the ceiling is almost identical to that of a Hyundai Accent, which is not a complement.  At least it seems put together fairly well.  

It's not very comfortable.  It lacks arnrests for passengers front and rear.  The rear seat is very cramped for average sized males, especially in legroom.  I can't complain about headroom however.  At 60 mph I can't hear backseat passengers talking, the road noise is so loud.  

The AWD works well and its engagement is almost imperceptible. The only real problem has been that our transmission went out 26,000 miles.  Fortunately it was under warranty.  

Overall, if you need AWD, get a Subaru legacy or Impreza.  If you don't, for the money there are so many better choices.  Almost any midsize car would be cheaper and better optioned, not to mention, quieter, roomier and more comfortable.<br><br>
