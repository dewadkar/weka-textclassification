            I bought a 1990 LS400 in May 1998 with 112,000 miles on it and love it.  It now has 128,000 miles, but the past 4 months have proved that this isn't the perfect car.   I GOT RID OF IT WITH 135,000 MILES ON IT.  SINCE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SELL EXCEPT TO A CROOKED USED CAR DEALER, I GAVE IT TO MY CHURCH.  (long story, more to this than just the car) THE WHOLESALE BLUE BOOK WAS $8100 AND THE USED CAR DEALER OFFERED ME $6000.  I ROLLED MY EYES THINKING "I SPENT $6300 IN REPAIRS THE PAST 18 MONTHS!"

March 1999 - Heater control valve was leaking - - - $239 to replace.

June 1999 - Oil change and advised that the AC compressor was leaking.  $109.  

The dealer practices are what I expected for a upper-class car make.  It concerned me when the service advisor threw 4-digit repair bills like it was no big deal, so I haven't been back since the $40 oil change.

July 1999 the AC compressor died (in Las Vegas that isn't acceptable when it's 110 degrees in the shade)  that set me back $1200.

July 1999 the air suspension froze-up and the car was not safe to drive.  The driver side front shock was all the way down to the ground, and the passenger side rear was all the way up.  Apparently when the shocks leak too much the pump ($1600 to replace) shuts off and you are stuck with a mind shattering stiff ride with no air coming in or out of the suspension.  I opted to gut the air suspension and replace it with factory shock and strut suspension and saved $800 over repairing the problematic air suspension.  Each air shock costs $800 and has to be replaced in pairs.  This was done at the same time as the AC compressor and this alone cost $2200 to do.  I was confident that this would be a permanent fix because the air shocks only last approximately 40,000 miles.

Eight days later a high pressure freon hose broke.  At this point my mechanic felt sorry for me and only charged me the cost of the part  - - - $156.  

October 1999 - Power steering rack was leaking and 8 new spark plugs were needed. - - $940.  They also replaced the antifreeze no charge.  I think they discovered the "new guy" shouldn't have told me that regular green antifreeze won't hurt it.  I've heard and read that only the pink alcohol(?) based antifreeze is to be used.

FROM OCTOBER 1999 TO MARCH 2001 I ALSO:

REPLACED THE POWER STEERING RACK AGAIN  $260 (MECHANIC FELT SORRY FOR ME AGAIN CUT ME A GREAT DEAL).

REPLACED THE BATTERY TWICE  $120 FIRST TIME, THE SECOND WAS REPLACED FREE UNDER WARRANTY.

REPLACED TIMING BELT AND WATER PUMP, WATER PUMP WAS LEAKING TIMING BELT WASN'T DUE FOR CHANGING FOR ANOTHER 20000 MILES.  $650

I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO RELIEVED TO BE RID OF SOMETHING LIKE I WAS THIS CAR.  NIGHTMARE AFTER NIGHTMARE WAS THE STORY WITH THIS AUTOMOBILE.  I ONLY DROVE IT 2600 MILES THE LAST 13 MONTHS I HAD IT AND IT SEEMED SOMETHING WAS LEAKING OR BREAKING ALL THE TIME.

I VALETED A LEXUS JUST LIKE THIS ONE I HAD AT WORK AND IT HAD 300,000 MILES ON IT.  I KNEW IT WAS POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE THAT, BUT AT WHAT PRICE?!?!?!??!

LEXUS MAKES A FINE AUTOMOBILE, BUT I'LL NEVER EVER EVER RECOMMEND ANYONE BUYING ONE WITHOUT A WARRANTY.

I'm in need of new front brake pads and rotors which will cost $425 when that is done.  The car stops fine, but sometimes shakes violently when I am braking.

Unfortunately for my Mastercard, I love this car and will hate the day that comes when it's gone.  My mechanic assured me he shouldn't be seeing me for a while except the for the brakes within the next few months. 

I took a road trip to L.A. last week and received an amazing 25 MPG travelling 80 to 85 MPH most of the trip.
