            The mc3 is an okay idea, but is almost half a product. I almost wish I could see the next version of this, because I'm sure it would be something I'd be happier with. The mc3 is a multimedia device for capturing digital stills and video and for listening to MP3 format digital music.
  The unit is targeted at active youths for outdoor activities. The camera's resolution is 640-by-480 for still images. For QuickTime format movies, the mc3 has 320-by-240 resolution at either 10 or 20 frames per second. (Length of movies and number of stills depend on the size of the CompactFlash removable media.)
  The mc3 is designed for low-power usage. It has a 1.6-inch reflective LCD, geared to outdoor review of images or for information display of MP3 music.
  That�s one of the reasons why the unit -- I can�t really call it a camera -- is a missed effort. The Kodak engineers paid so much attention to power-saving designs; they�ve actually limited its usefulness. Didn�t it occur to them that perhaps shutterbugs would want to use it indoors? Well, you can�t! The low-power reflective LCD is impossible to see indoors. That�s because the LCD relies on the ambient light to illuminate the image.
  Since there isn�t an optical viewfinder, the LCD is the only way to compose a picture.
  Also, there�s no flash unit. All in all, this is an outdoors-only picture-taking machine. Yet, for an outdoors-intended device, it�s not really suited for that either. There�s no lens cap or weatherproofing.
  As an MP3 player, I actually found the mc3 to be pretty capable. The LCD provides song information in a clear and concise manner, on a screen that is much nicer (if outdoors) than many MP3-only players.
  The mc3 comes bundled with three AAA batteries,which are inserted in the oversized handgrip. This makes it lopsided when you hold it. I also wonder why a rechargeable battery wasn't built for this; they created an optional USB dock as an accessory. It would have been much cooler if this also recharged the battery as well.
  Other bundled items include ear buds, USB cable and video- and image-editing software. The device comes in two configurations: A $229 version (with 16 Mb CompactFlash card) and a $299 version (with 64 Mb CompactFlash card). Optional accessories include a dock with USB cable, AV cable and carrying case.
