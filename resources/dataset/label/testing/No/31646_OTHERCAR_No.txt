                Since the first time I saw the car, several years earlier..I wanted it and had to have it.  Finally, when I could afford it, I purchased the car in July 1998.  
    I took the car in for minor things to start (new car stuff).
    Beginning in September 1998, the reality of my misfortune began to take place.  A knocking noise from under the chassis (sounded like someone hitting the undercarriage with a wrench) began.  The car has gone in a total of 6 times for this problem (unable to be fixed).  They have replaced struts, catalytic convertor, and other items to suppress &quot;the noise&quot;.  The car horn has gone out 4 times.  The temperature indicator has gone out twice, and a laundry list of other odds and ends.
    To date the car's horn is out again, and the noise is louder than ever.  Currently, I am in the midst of litigation. 
    What can I say, I traded in a Mitsubishi Diamante (1993), basically trouble free, for the car of my dreams...and it turns out to be a nightmare. 
    I still love the ride of the car, but after 5 minutes of hearing a knocking sound it's all for not.  It's a beautiful car, but it is only skin (and interior) deep.<br><br>
