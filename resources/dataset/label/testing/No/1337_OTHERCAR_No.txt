            In July 1999 i traded in my trusty but tired 91' Dodge Dakota for a 1999 Chevy Silverado. I got the 4800v8,4wd automatic, a/c, tow package, no fancy stuff. I bought this truck for its very smooth ride, comfortable seats and its power. All of these features still make me glad for buying a silverado. However I should have known better not to buy one when I test drove one the transmission failed and we had to get towed back to the dealer. The salesman was good and I ended up buying Chevy anyhow.

When I picked up this truck it was like driving home a cadillac after my previous truck. I have absolutely no complaints about the how this truck drives. It handles nice, rides smooth, quiet no wind noise, no rattily features, and smooth breaking. I also tow a 16' flatbed tandem axle trailer approximately 5000 lbs. loaded. I can honestly say this truck tows that trailer as if its not even there. Plenty of reserve power. Gas mileage is great too I average 16mpg even hauling a good load. That's it for good news.

The payload capacity of the cargo box itself leaves a lot to be desired. the second day I had this truck I threw about 500lbs of gear in the back and was shocked to see the poor truck sag to the ground I figure its max is about 800lbs., certainly not a half ton. My old Dakota could haul twice the weight. I have helper springs on order I just hope I wont sacrifice my smooth ride.

In December the engine occasionally began stalling after short trips at my second oil change I had the dealer look at it with no finding. The end of February I started noticing a faint rumbling somewhere in the steering.
It slowly got worse then in March one night driving home my service engine soon light came on. I checked all the fluids, hoses, belt, gas cap etc. found no trouble. The next day I called my dealer and told them the details and they scheduled for the following monday. I dropped the truck off for monday morning they kept it until wednesday For 3 days I was without a truck in those 3 days they had several mechanics drive it look at it and put their computer on it. They found nothing wrong they did not even hear steering noise which is very noticeable now. So I got my truck back still broke all they managed to fix was to shut off the idiot light. 

Maybe when its time to trade this truck in they will have bugs worked out of this model, but I don't think its gonna last that long. I would look at the Toyota Tundra for my next vehicle!
