            I recently rented a midsize car in Reno and I got a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee instead.  Quite a deal, huh? See this review to see how this happened.

Anyway, what did I think of this SUV??

<b>Exterior</b>

It has average styling for an SUV.  They are typically big vehicles and this goes along with the trend.  There were already a few chips in the paint, so I don't know if it is poor paint, or the fact that it's a rental.  I wouldn't have expected much body damage with only 8000 miles on it.

<b>Interior</b>

The inside was very spacious.  I think you could seat 5 without difficulty.  The fabric was nice on the seats (not leather, but in the heat I wouldn't have wanted leather anyway).  The inside looked more classy than the exterior did.

<b>Interior features</b>

The coolest feature had to be the digital thermometer (outside temperature) and digital compass.  I've never driven a car with this before!  In addition it had cruise, AM/FM cassette (I'm sure CD is available), A/C, power windows and locks.  This car had most of the comforts you would expect.  

<b>Power</b>

Now, I'm no car expert ("Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a mechanic"), but I think this vehicle is underpowered.  It has a V6 engine and for this size SUV, I didn't feel we had enough power.  Now I'm used to a manual and I was driving an automatic, but I still think that they could give this a little more.  I cannot imagine trying to tow using this beast!

<b>Handling</b>

It's got a nice smooth ride to it, but I wouldn't want to parallel park this thing!  I drive an SUV normally (1998 Isuzu Rodeo), so I'm used to big, but this didn't handle well at all.  

<b>Gas mileage</b>

I didn't calculate it, but I'd guess it to be about 17 mpg.  Now, I know it's an SUV, but even my Rodeo gets about 22-23 mpg.

<i>Editorial note:  Wow!  It is taking me a long time to write this.  I have a patient in labor right now.</i>

<b>Interior space</b>

I don't know the exact specs, and I didn't do a lot of hauling with this SUV, but it seems as though it could hold a lot.

<b>Overall</b>

I think this was an OK SUV to rent (especially since I didn't pay to rent the SUV, only the midsize price), but I don't think I would ever consider buying this.  I've not been impressed with Jeep in the past, and I think it is overpriced for the power you get.

Thanks for reading my review.
