            This is an excellent car for those who refuse to buy imports, but those who refuse to buy imports do so at their own peril. It has been proven an overabundance of times that American cars are far from dependable. I knew this when i bought this car, but I still believed in that Saturn promise of being different.
Well, it was different than any other American car I'd ever owned, but it was in no where near as good as the Honda that it replaced. Who would have thought a 1992 Saturn with 100k would have me wishing i still had my 1984 Honda with 180k? 
This car suffers from plastic jitters, problems with the power windows, and some sort of an engine problem which has the car eating through catalytic converters. What's worse is that it will cost me a few hundred dollars just for a mechanic to take a look at what is wrong inside because Saturns are built in such a way that they require more time in labor. 
Getting the A/C recharged is another hidden gem, at a wopping $440.
But the real kicker with this car was the day i leaned back to get some change out of my pocket and the seat back broke in half! Now I'm not a big guy or anything, so trust me it's just that cheaply made. Now i have a car that can't pass inspection and puts my at risk of my life everytime i operate it. What's more, the seat back will cost $300 to replace.

There are much, much better choices in this category. 

Still better than a Ford or a Chevy, that's for sure, plus it holds its resale value better than those cars.
    BUT
Honda. Honda. It seems all i can say to myself anymore is Honda.
