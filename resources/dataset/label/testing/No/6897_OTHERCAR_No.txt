After waiting 4 months [including several weeks of unanticipated delays; it was supposed to be here 11/25] for my 2004 Porsche Cayenne Twin turbo, I was initially excited to take possession of it late december [12/20] 2003.  It was special ordered from Germany, with significant upgrades, including the off-road package, sport pipes, navigation system, etc...

The first few days the Porsche performed well in terms of handling, etc..., but the door locks were erratic and didn't seem to respond to the electronic keys.  Appeals to the dealer and service technicians were generally unhelpful, and I finally resolved myself to having to open the door from the drivers side for the next several years.  

Next, on the afternoon of 12/22,  came the stalls.  The entire electrical system turned off on several occasions when I attempted to start up the engine. This started on  Porsche roadside assistance was contacted [they promptly and courteously arrived w/ jumper cables], and after several episodes of these stalls and jump starts, service technicians at Stead motors told me there was something wrong with the battery, and it would need repair.  I was told to drive the car for 45 minutes to an hour after the jump start, and to take the car in for formal assessment on 12/26, when the battery could be changed.  BTW; the rear lift gate also was stuck closed and wouldn't open after the first stall on December 22nd.  

Originally, the rear door light was stuck on and the signal for the door would blink on the dash with attendant noise.  The sales agents [Niello Porsche - Sacramento] recommendation to 'close the door harder' and 'make sure the rear gate is closed' despite multiple maddening attempts didn't resolve the problem.  The beeping stopped, but the door got locked permanently shut.  Sadly, the car was ordered from a dealer in Sacramento [Niello Acura-Porsche], and the closest repair facility was in my area, Walnut Creek, CA, approximately 70 miles away from the source.  At the dealers recommendation, I took the car in to Stead Motors in Walnut Creek for repair.    

Initially, the service manager offered an enterprise rental car for my use while the repair was undertaken, but after enterprise [located next door] told me they had no car, he offered me a ride to my office and told me I could get reimbursed $30/day for a rental.  I told him I thought this was ridiculous, since the car was brand new, and an economy Hertz rental was $59/day; why was I being further penalized for buying a lemon of a car?  

I went to my office anyway [I'm a physician and had to attend to some patient care issues], and made reservations for a Hertz car [I had an important engagement in LA I had to leave for at 2:00 pm that day; the dealer was to call me by noon, but didn't get in touch till 1:45 - but that's another story...].  Finally I got in touch with the mechanics, and they told me the car was ready, but the lift gate was still stuck shut [it would have to be repaired on another occasion].  They assured me they had done a complete check of the electrical system by computerized analysis and it looked fine.  I got a shuttle ride to the dealership, got the Cayenne, thanked the mechanics and went to the post-office about 0.5 miles away, only to have the same stall problem after picking up my mail.  A technician came out and jump started the car and I drove it to Stead motors again [by now it was about 4:00 pm, and I was late for the trip to LA  - The Hertz rental was cancelled because I was told the Cayenne was fine]. I left the Cayenne at Steads for repairs over the weekend - it was the afternoon of 12/26.  This time the service mgr. got me a boxter rental and I accepted it gladly, but struck with the apparent crappy,  over-rated mechanical reliability of Porsche [this was my first one], I used my fathers Buick Electra for the trip to LA.  

Monday afternoon [12/29] the service manager called me to tell me the car was ready.  The  thorough inspection the preceding friday had revealed that the tire pressure had not been relieved upon initial receipt of the vehicle [they overinflate during shipment].  This was readily friday remedied by relieving some pressure, but the evaluation of the faulty electrical system on monday had revealed the leads to the battery were literally disconnected - they were simply resting on the battery terminals!  According to the manager, that's why the car sporadically started or not on so many occasions.  He indicated that the tire pressure issue and battery connection, etc... were part of a manddatory pre-purchase screen which is performed on each Porsche, but appeared to have not been performed on this one.  I couldn't fathom the apparent indifference/ineptitude of the initial Porsche technicians at Niello before presenting this unprepared car to a customer, but was delighted that at least after much suffering/time lost from work/angst over the holidays the problem had finally been resolved.   

The lift gate now worked, although the handle had been replaced with a butt-ugly black plastic unit instead of the original piece...

The electrical system with the doors still remains a mystery, and never works for the passenger doors.  From time to time [about every third time I try to enter or exit the car], the car alarm goes off without provocation...

This morning, 12/31, a new problem arose spontaneously...The warning signal for the rear lift gate began beeping loudly every two seconds.  
The gate was repeatedly opened and closed carefully, including the lift gate, the glass top panel, and the rear tire console.  The maddening alarm and its dash board signal still keep going off every time I drive.  

I have a call in to Porsche to get the car problem addressed, but am rapidly losing all faith in this product. 
The technicians apparently don't know how the car is put together [in their defense, it is a new model; their technical expertise in Cayenne complications is limited and maybe I should have waited a few years].  Because Porsche is closed on 1/1/04, I will not use the car tomorrow, and hope it can be checked on friday 1/2/04.  

Now the good things: despite almost complete ineptitude in dealing with my cars problems, the dealer, service techs, etc... were otherwise pleasant and professional [except for the car rental b.s. [above]].  The car is very fast, maneuvers well, has excellent ride, and accelerates and handles beautifully.  Too bad about the mind numbins incessant chirping of the rear lift gate alarm, the replacement handle, the door locks.  If only the Porsche engineers could go back to work and it could work as well as a Ford or Chevy mechanically and electrically...

If there is any more crap I have to put up with repairing a brand new Porsche, I guarantee you I will never buy this brand again...   I had been a loyal BMW customer [also bought from Niello] and loved the brand and service.  I bought the Cayenne because I liked he test ride better than the BMW X5, but now am having some serious second thoughts...

I want to impress upon Porsche what they are going to lose here - I buy about one new luxury car every 1-2 years; many of my friends do the same, I hope someone from Porsche considers how this incredibly negative experience will color my perception of their over-rated German engineering quality...
