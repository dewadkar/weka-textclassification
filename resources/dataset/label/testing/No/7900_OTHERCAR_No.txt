               I'm guessing you've read a few other reviews already, and are no doubt familiar with the features and specs of this camera, so we'll deal with living with it.

   I originally purchased this camera around fifteen months ago as a gift for my wife, as she had taken a shine to my 1.3Mp Olympus D-150. While this camera was larger, it offered 2.1Mp resolution, and more "non-menu" controlled features.
   She loved this camera, and it gave birth to an interest in photography, which I have encouraged, and nourished by trading her up to a Canon G2 this Christmas, While I inherited the A20, and our daughter now has the D-150. 

   In general photography, the results from this camera are more than adequate to satisfy the average amateur user, and only the limitations of it's available features prevent the more artistic use of an enthusiast. 
   However, I must qualify this by stating that we do use powerful photo-editing software at home, and can correct exposure problems, color casts, or composure prior to printing. This means that we can operate to a wider tolerance than some. If you intend to just use the shots "as is", you may (depending on your personal tastes) find the results mildly over exposed (around 1/2 stop), but this can be adjusted on the camera to suit yourself. Never having used the software supplied with the camera, I can't comment on it.
 
   I use a digital camera primarily for work. I am an  electrical engineer for a machine manufacturer, and am required to carry out field work to prove new designs, investigate possible design issues, and commissionings of modified proven products. 
  This gives me a requirement for taking "technical photography" shots to expound upon what I have observed in the field. Frequently these shots are taken internally to machinery, and under very poor lighting conditions. I frequently use the "Macro" mode, and some are even taken "blind", with the camera at arms length.
Even under these circumstances I can normally produce the evidence I need quickly and easily.
  At home, we use a card reader to download the images, and having done so since we've had the camera, no-one seem to know where it's cabling is now....... So, when I recently had to produce some images quickly at work for a briefing,a lack of proprietry cord let me down. Had it been a standard USB (like Olympus cameras), This would not have happened.
   I have since purchased a PC Card adaptor for the CF card, so I can now load the images directly into my laptop.
   Personally, I find the menu options less easy to use than the Olympus version, but my wife views things the other way round, so I guess this is just a matter of personal taste and familiarity.

   Like most digital cameras, especially when using the screen a lot, battery life was poor, then my friend told me about "photolife" (Energizer Eï¿½ photo lithium) batteries. These are around twice the price of standard alkalines, but are designed for this use, and last fantastically well. I find myself changing batteries around every two months now, rather than about weekly as it was before. So now I have no complaints there. 
  Also, the supplied memory card is hopelessly inadequate, and was quickly replaced by a 64Mb unit. As I only shoot with the minimum compression possible, this at least allows me to take a reasonable number of shots (65, as opposed to 7, as supplied. Fortunately these are now reasonably priced, but when thinking of buying, factor in the price of additional memory.

In summary, much as though I hate to let the camera do the thinking for me, the nature of my usage requires it to be so. This camera has never let either my wife, or myself, down, continually producing results within the limits we operate with easily.
