            15 Months old, 21+ unscheduled service visits.  With all that's been replaced it should be a 2001...

GM SmartLease -- A Deal with the Devil.
http://www.lemoncar.ca

In October 1999 we took possession of a brand new 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier under the terms of a 36 month GMAC SmartLease. During our first 15 months with this vehicle it has been in for unscheduled service more than 19 times, an average of once every three weeks. We find this to be unacceptable, and have asked General Motors for assistance to terminate our lease on this vehicle. This experience has become a nightmare. The staff at General Motors customer service have been arrogant, rude and condescending to us through this entire process. General Motors of Canada is refusing to take responsibility for this abnormally unreliable automobile, but are willing to continuously 'repair, but not replace' this vehicle, until the warranty runs out.

General Motors has no regard for the overwhelming amount of time and effort invested by us to keep this vehicle running. They have indicated they will no longer be reviewing our case, and no action will be taken by them to assist us any further. By refusing to do anything reasonable to amend the situation, they are implying it�s just fine with them, business as usual.

General Motors has given us two choices. We are allowed to give GM $6300 for the privilege of having been leased a lemon and return the vehicle, leaving us without a vehicle. Option two is that we can pay them $3900, and lease a new GM vehicle. Essentially they are asking us to pay for their mistake and enjoy the ride.

We have been dealing with Mews Chevrolet Oldsmobile, and they have been most helpful in trying to find us a solution. However, they are restricted by their colleagues at GM who have been most unwilling to help us out. General Motors position is that as long as the vehicle is repairable, it is the customer�s problem not theirs. One GM representative has told us that the problems we have experienced are of a �cosmetic� nature and are not considered grounds for a buyback or further assistance. Please be aware that the attached service history represents �cosmetic� issues and is completely acceptable to General Motors. The following are �cosmetic� components on new General Motors vehicles:

Front Brakes
Rear Brakes
Anti-Lock Braking Systems
Traction Control Systems
Transmissions
Air-Conditioner Compressors
Emergency Jack
Windshield Washer Nozzles

It�s time for General Motors to take responsibility for sub-standard products, horrible customer support, and own up to their manufacturing mistakes.
