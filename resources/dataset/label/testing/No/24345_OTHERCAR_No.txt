            I've already written an opinion on this truck but it needs updating.  When I bought the truck I bought a new spray in Rhinoliner.  I've had a Rhinoliner in my Chevy for three years and it is still undamaged so I wanted to give my new Dakota the same protection.  I had noticed that the paint on this truck scuffs easily and seems to be very thin and soft.  It is almost as if the outer coat doesn't adhere to the primer as well as it should. My friend who has a 2000 Dakota has the same problem, his paint is badly scuffed and scratched.

  One day, I loaded a shelf unit into my Dakota by sliding it over the Rhinoliner.  Now, I've done the same thing to my chevy liner for years with no damage.  Imagine my chagrin when the paint in the bed of my Dakota let go of the primer and the Rhinoliner rolled up like a carpet!!!  I took it to the dealer to have them check the paint and Cruise control, and transmission, and air leaks, and upholstery coming apart, and rubber door gaskets falling off. They fixed the gasket, re-hooked the upholstery fasteners and said everything else, including the rolled up Rhinoliner was NOT THEIR FAULT!!! 

I have been to three different Dodge dealers for service and all of them have consistently &quot;dodged&quot; their responsibilities under the warranty.  Is this Chrysler policy, to avoid the expense of legitimate warranty work, or do the service people know that you cant make a flawed design work right and therefore will not waste time trying?  I think it's a little of the first and a whole lot of the second.  

The last time I went for service the service manager told me that he wished he had his 96 Dakota back because the 2000 Dakota with V-6 which he now drives is not as good a truck.  Well, he knows that much anyway.  And I have a feeling he knows that there is no way to fix this deeply flawed design.<br><br>
