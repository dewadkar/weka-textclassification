            As my family expanded, it became time to ditch my beloved coupe in favor of a people- and stuff-hauler.  Trying to avoid a minivan, I chose a used '96 Sable GS wagon.  It was a comfortable car with the most generous cargo area of any wagon I found.  The car was comfortable for my passengers, but the driving position was a little awkward for me, a 6-foot-tall man.  I liked the car's amenities -- power windows and locks, power antenna, and heated side mirrors.  It was good on gas, and had great power.

Unfortunately, reliability was not this car's forte.  At about 40,000 miles, the head gasket blew, spewing rusty coolant all over my driveway.  $1,200 fixed it.  At about 45,000 miles, a freeze plug blew, again spewing rusty coolant all over my driveway.  A freeze plug is a $4 part that requires $1,000 in labor to replace.  Now, I don't know how my cooling system got rusty, *especially* the second time.  Something may have been fishy with my little wagon's history.  Not wanting to take any chances, after fixing the freeze plug I drove it straight to a Toyota dealer and traded it on a Sienna minivan, which is a much better vehicle.<br><br>
