            This camera has a lot of good features but it is much too large and heavy for the average tourist to pack for transport or carry around while sight-seeing.  For that one reason only, I would not recommend it to anyone who may want to use it while travelling away from home.  The only other possible negative is the use of floppy disks instead of memory sticks.  Floppy disks are convenient and it is easy to load pictures into the computer from the A drive but memory sticks have much more space and devices are now available to make loading into the computer easy.  I found the camera easy to learn how to operate.  For those who decide to buy this camera, I recommend buying an extra battery (about $70) to prevent getting stuck in the middle of a photo session with a dead battery.   <br><br>
