            I bought my catera about six months ago, it has been in the shop five times, it rattles when going over bumps and the carpeting is coming off the floor.  I called Cadillac for two months before i received  a call back about the car,i was told it would be replaced. two weeks later they called back and said as long as it was under warranty it would be fixed! so i asked &quot;if this car goes in the shop twelve times in the next twelve months all you intend to do is fix it?&quot; the response was yes! i can not believe that after spending $38,000 on a car that this is the treatment that you should expect. one of the things that i think is unfair is the fact that this is a lease and all of the extra miles i put on this car to drive to the repair shop and the extra miles they put on the car by test diving it after repair comes out of my wallet at the end of the lease.  i am very disappointed         <br><br>
