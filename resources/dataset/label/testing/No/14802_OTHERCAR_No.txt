            This letter as written to the PR Director of Volvo should cover our feelings about the vehicle and problems we encountered- all 12 pages of service records. Oh, and of course Volvo's response: "We're sorry you have had trouble with your 1999 S80, they did have inherent initial problems, but we can't help you." A great reward for 30 years of brand loyalty. We'll be Volvo-free VERY shortly!

A BRIEF LIST OF 1999 S80 T6 ISSUES BEYOND REGULAR WEAR & TEAR.

As per our conversation, here is a brief list of technological issues we are having with our car. All seem quite bizarre and are certainly unexpected considering the reliability of the 12 Volvo�s, P1800 through S80, T6, which we have collectively owned prior. 

Over the 30 years, we have admired Volvo, the car and the corporation, and have been loyal to your brand. The S80 has questioned our loyalty. We are extremely disappointed (a vast understatement) in this car, and the dealer�s efforts to solve our numerous and endless problems. I guess after all of these years of patronage, our hope is that Volvo will step up to the plate for us. Here is an initial list of� things that make us go hmmmm�?

�Ghostly� Issues
�	Seats randomly move while vehicle is in motion.
�	Lumbar tightens & softens randomly (now we know  
        this is a manual feature, but some way, some how,  
        the lower seat back has moved while driving).
�	Ignition is turned on and rear window opened.
�	The passenger door opened once while the car was 
        in motion with no preceding messages. Door had been 
        closed tightly all day.  
�	Radio has gone randomly on several occasions. But, 
        at least it�s a pre-selected station Barbara enjoys 
Other Persistent Issues
�	Profound left side rattle.
�	Car seems to remain on for up to 2 hours after keys 
        are removed, the fan or blower remains on. It may 
        go off, but can and will restart randomly.
�	When vehicle is put in reverse, the vehicle remains 
        stationary while accelerator is depressed for 5-6 
        seconds.
�	Rear driver-side door gives a message its open, 
        very often with flashing light. Must stop the car, 
        open and re-close. Hitting a bump, among other 
        things, seem cause this.
�	Check engine light has gone on many, many times 
        with the occasional panic message of stop 
        immediately. We call the dealer immediately, and 
        they nonchalantly respond �its just a quirk, ignore 
        it for now.� 
�	Front end clunking. Was recalled and repaired, but, 
        it came back. Most issues dealt with and serviced, 
        have come back. 
�	In the summer months, the car has a chronic fishy 
        smell. Volvo initially suggested it was the 
        heating/air system and suggested adding Chlorox;  
        yes Chlorox, to the coolant system. Is that healthy 
        for us? After we had a collective aneurysm, they 
        changed their minds, and made some adjustments. 
�	Additional foul odors persist which service claims 
        must be the leather, and yes, that�s the premium 
        leather option we opted for at great expense. 
�	Cold draft persists to the right of the accelerator 
        pedal.
�	Seat memory loses settings each time it snows. 
�	In addition to and in support of our claims we have 
        included the service records from our dealership 
        beginning in Oct. of 1999 through Dec. 2001.
�	And, I�ll tell you based on learning a bit about 
        this ghost, the results of the National Insurance 
        Institutes finding on your 5mph crash test, don�t  
        surprise me in the least.

The car is now three years old. It has been serviced more times than all of our other Volvos collectively. We live in fear of the next calamity that befalls this car. After each service call we expect that that most recently repaired issues are the last. Not so. Either the same issue persists or a new one arises. Our frustration is enormous.
In preparation for this letter, we reviewed the service reports from Eagle Auto Mall. A good deal of the service issues that we have reported over the past three years are not documented by Eagle, supporting the theory that a good deal of the problems reported were not taken seriously.
We are looking to you, Dan, to help us to do what is necessary to have a Volvo that we can once again call reliable and to renew our faith in Volvo as a responsible automotive manufacturer. We appreciate your help on this and look forward to hearing from you soon. 

We got offered the opportunity to buy a 2002 Demo model at near retail value and offer wholesale for ours. That was Volvo's abysmal solution.
