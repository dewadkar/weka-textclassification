            This is the worst car I have ever driven, except for a 1976 Nova that cost $400 and was only supposed to get me through one last semester of school.  This one, however, cost over $15,0000, and was supposed to be a new car.

This was my wife's first real new car.  First, the dealer was supposed to supply a brand new, GM employee discount car.  Instead, on the day of delivery, they gave her the option of a program car with more bells &amp; whistles, or waiting for a car they were supposed to have ready.  If this happens to you, walk from the dealership.  Don't look back.

Then, at 3,000 miles, and after telling the dealer repeatedly that there was engine noise and other engine trouble and them saying the car was fine, the entire engine had to be replaced.  Thank God for warranties, but if the dealer had listened to the customer, Pontiac would probably not have had to replace an entire engine.

The moral of that story - don't go to Pontiac dealers in Buffalo, NY, especially North Buffalo.  They will lie to you and take advantage of you - repeatedly.

Then, at 15,000 miles, the front suspension was fixed under recall.  At 30,000, a cellunoid in the front right brake system developed intermittent noise which has never been diagnosed.

Here, however, I have a recommendation - If you live in Western New York, the most hard working, honest Pontiac dealer repair shop is on Transit Rd. in Lockport.  Ask for John.  You couldn't have asked for a better mechanic who actually listened to a single woman's concerns, and took her seriously.  (My wife got the car before we were married.)  The sales people are known to treat women like they don't know what they're talking about, but the maintenance department is the best you could ask for.

At 70,000 miles, the transmission fluid became fouled for unexplained reasons.  This was after it had already been serviced at its scheduled interval.  At 84,000 miles, the air conditioning compressor needed replacing - $400 for a patch job, $800 if we opted for the full replacement.  At 85,000 miles, the daytime running lights stopped working.  At 85,000 miles, the coolant system developed a small, but labor-intensive and very expensive-to-fix, leak.

The aluminum wheels - always leak air.  You can't afford to not pay attention to your air pressure, unless you don't mind being late for work because you've got another flat.

If you're over two hundred pounds, as many normal-sized guys are, the seats are brutal.  Pontiac did not put in enough padding, probably on the theory that only women drive Grand Ams regularly.  If you're six foot tall, the seats hit you in the wrong place in the back - the car is made for smaller people.  Plus, leg room is scarce, even in the front.  If you're five foot, five, you're fine.  Otherwise, move along to another car.  My 1991 Nissan Sentra was by far superior as far as front seat comfort and leg room are concerned.

About its performance - It moves fast enough for a domestic mid-size sedan.  Nothing inspiring.  Even a low-level Honda Accord has more fun appeal.  However, getting up to merging speed is a breeze.  The Dodge Stratus from the same relative era is much wider and has much more room in the front and back.  Early Chevy Malibus are more comfortable with less bumps.  Nissan Altimas rock in comparison.

It does everything it should for a cheap four-door sedan, as long as the pavement is smooth as glass.  On brand new pavement, it's smooth as a baby's bottom.  But where in the Northeast do you have brand new pavement?  You will wear your coffee on your shirt every morning on the way to the office like it's your personal fashion statement.  On even the slightest of bumps, the back end kicks up and over on you, and you feel like you're going to wreck the thing. It seems that Pontiac made the car light to be responsive through curves, but scrimped on the suspension, in order to keep the car cheap enough to stay competitive.

Believe me, over bumps, even if you're part of a younger, price-sensitive crowd like those just getting out of school and looking for a commuting car, you will feel every bump magnified to the n'th degree over what's minimally acceptable.  Keep looking.<br><br>
