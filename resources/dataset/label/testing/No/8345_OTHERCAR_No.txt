            I bought the Largan Lmini 350 digital, just to have a camera to take pictures for auctions. So as far as auctions go it is fine,but to much time involved for adjusting and editing. Strange though, it takes beautiful clear pictures outdoors (in the DAYTIME),BUT at night forget it, you are just out of luck. Using artificial light of any type just does not seem to work well with this camera. The pictures are either just barely visible or so bright that you can not fix them, even with photo editing software. The contrast seems to be the problem, at least with my experience of the pictures I have taken. Some pictures can be repaired with the Adobe Photo 3.0 software included with the camera. The Photo 3.0 software does however, make downloading the pictures a snap. To download the pictures,you just open the Adobe Photo 3.0 program, click onto,(get photos), then click on the digital camera.
If you want the pictures to download onto the computer all at the same time,then hold down the shift key, while you make the choice to download all the photos. The instructions however, do not tell you this bit of information. I had to figure it out. Some of the pictures look like just a black square, but those can usually be fixed by bringing up the brightness until the picture is visible. Some of the pictures can be visible, if you play around with brightness and contrast. This, I might add is an awful lot of work to get a picture, so that it is viewable, but what can you really expect with such a cheap price. However, cheap or expensive, you are entitled to get what is advertised and in my opinion, you do not get what is promised, without having a Detective Degree of some type to pick it apart. When I tried to get Largan to help, it hit a dead end. You have to get it from the people from whom you purchased the camera. Of course they only sell them and do not know much else. I had sore fingers just trying to get the pictures to erase. I probably click them 20 or so times before it finally kicks in and starts to erase the pictures. Having to do this, in its self alone, will run the battery life down real fast. This camera is ok for Pictures outside during the daylight hours, but I would rather have a 35mm any day. The only good thing I have really found in this camera, is the convenience it gives for auctions and the money you save on film. You are the one that will have to ask yourself, " Is it worth the money saved for the time and headaches involved in trying to figure out all the things that are not explained in the instruction?" Lets face it, the trouble shooting is useless in the online manual. It does not address any of the actual problems encountered with this camera.
