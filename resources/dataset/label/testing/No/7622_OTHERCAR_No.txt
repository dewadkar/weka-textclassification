            I bought a 1996 SLT 4x4 Jimmy in 1998 with 35,000 miles.  I soon fell in love with my Jimmy until my habits caught up with me.  I spend an inordinate amount of time in the woods hunting and fishing.  This Jimmy was exactly what I wanted as far as having comfort and reliability in one package.  It gets me every where I need to go and I have never got into anything with it I couldn't get myself out off.  However, I think I have paid an unfair price for using it off road.  After having my Jimmy for only 5,000 miles I had to replace all the universal joints and the ball joints costing a nausating $2,200.  I'm not extremley rough on my Jimmy, but since I've had it I've had three sets of ball joints. And, since I first bought this Jimmy the ride had become more loose.  The shop said this is really not all that uncommon. So if your looking for something to carry your family around and get you to all those hard to reach off road honey holes for recreation, I suggest getting something that has an off road suspension like a Z-71.  But overall, for in the city purposes this is a great vehicle.<br><br>
