            <I>I am sure that I am the final entry into this write off.  While I am sure I still have my reasones.  My reasons are based in the arsenic waters of memory and respect.  I remember Rodiem to this day and I respect what he would want to read from me.

Roadiem was my best friend on this site.  I chatted with him almost daily during his final months and I loved every minute of it.  Rodiem was the brother that I had never had.  We often talked about this in regards to our similarities.  

We met with a comment that I left upon his Slap Shot movie review, we departed in a hail of tragedy for poor Roadiem.  I�m sorry that my epinion is so late in coming but I simply had to find something to write about of which, I think Roadiem would be happy with.  

Roadiem use to always tell me that my articles made him laugh.  This admission of his was funny because Roadiem�s articles use to always make me laugh.  One time I chatted with his wife and she told me that Rodiem and I were one and the same when it comes to any sense of humor. 

I�m sorry if this review offends any of you.  Based upon my conversations with Roadiem (Mike) I feel that he would like this.  I�m just trying to give my best �web based friend� his best giggle in the �other world�.  I�m sure that, if there is a heaven, he is reading all of us now.</i>

The crowd gathered outside of the Ritz restaurant and hotel in Paris writhed and seethed in a massive array of bodies clamoring among one another for a rare chance to get glimpse of the former Princess of Wales.  Occasionally as a familiar looking shadow passed the front windows of the restaurant the crowd would swell forward and erupt into a deafening cacophony of excited shouts punctuated by the blinding explosion of flashbulbs from a hundred different cameras.  These were normal citizens, tourist, and hungry paparazzi that had been transformed into human predators by the promise of a peek at the actual flesh of Royalty.

Despite the large collection of people jumping about and climbing over one another in the haphazard mix of the riot outside one lone security officer still managed to spot two men of which he had been searching for the entire day.  These men were infidels of the highest nature the security guard had been informed by his boss Mohammed Al Fayed that morning.  Fayed had instructed the guard to shoot them dead on site and then return the bodies to him so that their corpses could be desecrated by a pack of wild dogs.

The security guard reached into his suit coat grabbing the butt of the handgun resting comfortably in his shoulder holster as he pushed his way through the crowd in the direction of the men.  One was a pudgy fellow with a goofy look about him that belied some inner ignorance.  The other was a more suave looking fellow with an air about him that seemed electrified with some sort of lure for women.  They were both clothed in brightly colored Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts while carrying golf clubs slung upon their shoulders.

Nearing the pair the security officer pulled his gun and leveled it in the men�s direction.  He was going to kill them, and he was going to kill the stupid looking one first.  Even though he had no knowledge of the pair�s prior indiscretions that may have brought them to this point, the security guard slowly cocked the hammer of his semi-automatic and aimed his Glock in the direction his prey.  Mohammed Al Fayed would soon have meat for his dogs.

Upon hearing the all too familiar click of a firearm being chambered with it�s first shell, the good looking member of the pair turned back to look.  �Hey bub.�  He said tapping his friend on the shoulder.  �I think this fellow likes you.�

Turning, the dumb looking one saw the security guard with his gun leveled upon him.  �He likes me.�  He said to his friend.  �Maybe he likes me a little too much.  Let�s get out�ta here!� 

The two ran; disappearing into the vast crowd before the security guard could fire.  Frantically giving chase the security guard brutally began to push his way through the mass.  In the end it was simply impossible for the security guard to find them.  They had vanished� seemingly into thin air.

�That guy almost knocked my clock off.�  The silly looking member of the pair said ducking behind the back of the hotel near a spray painted trash bin.

�With a face like yours that wouldn�t have been a big loss necessarily.�  The handsome fellow replied.  Looking around the vacated rear of the hotel, he soon spied a black Mercedes S-280 idling near a service doorway.  �Say Bob,� He asked knocking his friend on the shoulder.  �Whadda� say we hide out in those digs until all this flimflam passes.�

Bob turned to spy the luxurious car, his eyes going wide at its sight.  �Say, that�s one of those S-280�s I�ve been telling you about Bing!  I�m sure we could get the Sultan�s daughter-in-law to go away from his son with us in one of those.�

Bing nodded as he regarded the automobile.  �Well if it�ll help I�d be willing to trade up on a guy like you for some fine wheels like that.�

�Oh brother.�  Bob responded before following his friend to the car in a brisk jog.  �If I�d have known that you would fall in love with the Sultans daughter-in-law to be that I�d fallen in love with and then now a car before leaving Paris I would have left you where I�d found you.�

Nearing the car, Bing slowed for a moment, admiring its sleek design before responding.  �Where?�  He asked, looking at Bob intensely.  �On the road to Bali?�

Turning to face the camera, Bob replied.  �It actually did pretty well at the box office ladies and gentlemen.�  Turning to leave and then again turning to face the camera, Bob added.  �It just didn�t have a great opening weekend folks.�   

Getting into the car the pair admired it�s lavish interior.  While the Mercedes S-280 that they may have entered that night had tan leather seats that were bucketed for the ultimate in driver and passenger comfort, Bob and Bing were unaware that the leather of the S-280 also comes optional in black.

�What�s this?�  Bob asked turning on the S-280�s radio.  Elton John blared from the grossly inadequate speakers and surround sound system of the car causing Bing and Bob to jump simultaneously.  

�Not good.�  Bing replied turning off the radio.

The Mercedes S-280 comes equipped standard with a sub-par sound system.  You can upgrade to a better model but it will cost you an additional $2,000 at the dealership.  Bob and Bing argued about the radio system for a bit and then decided that it would be more advantageous to just avoid all the hub-bub of the manufacturer and install your own at Best Buy.  

As the pair were arguing about the radio two people rushed into the back seat slamming their respective doors shut behind them.   

�Take us back to the Arc de Triumphe.�  A mans voice said from the back of the car.

Upon hearing the voice, Bob and Bing cringed.  Knowing before they even turned to greet their passengers who the voice belonged to, they slowly swiveled their necks around to meet the face of Dodi Fayed, the very son of the Sheik who was after their hides.

�You.�  Dodi said, leaning forward in an aggressive manner to greet the pair upon recognizing them.  

Turning to Bing, Bob yelled.  �Quick, try out that mumbo jumbo potion the gypsy gave us back in Nice.�

Since the Mercedes S-280 is so incredibly quite, Bing was able to reflect back on the very moment that he met the gypsy in Nice.  Pausing a moment before extracting the elixir from his coat pocket, Bing thought about his encounter with the mysterious cleric.  He had told her of his amore for the Princess of Wales.

<b>WAVY MOTIONS TO INDICATE FLASHBACK.</b>

<I>Sitting across from the gypsy Bing had said.  �Hey, this babe is a real five star dish but she�s dating some Arab hubble-a-hoo whose daddy owns a big mall in London right now.  Can you set me up with something that�ll get this guy off my back.�

�The path to love is a treacherous coarse.�  The gypsy had replied.

�You can�t kid me kiddo.�  Bing answered nodding.  �I�ve known too many women to not know that love is a thing you gotta� stay away from.�

�Take this potion.�  The gypsy quipped handing him a vile filled with some sort of mixed up blue liquid.  �With it, you shall put her lover in a trance.  Then you will be able to woo her with your words.�

Taking the test tube, Bing responded.  �With that Arab out of the way maybe I can have a little fun with this here princess.�</I>

<B>WAVY MOTIONS END FLASHBACK.</b>

Forcing himself back into the present, Bing extracted the tube of potion from his coat pocket.  Turning to face the pair he tossed the contents of the vial directly into Dodi Fayed�s eyes sending him instantly into a trance.  All was silent in the car except for the rushed and frantic breath of Princess Di.

�Hey pal?�  Bob said, his hands clenched around the steering wheel in a white knuckled fury.  �Whadda want me to do here?  Sing you a song?�

�Drive.�  Bing simply said, crawling into the back seat and arranging himself between the terrified princess and her unconscious lover.

�Drive?�  Bob asked.  �I don�t even know where this Arc de Tri-something is.�

�Just take the river front expressway.�  Bing answered, giving his friend a dismissing motion.

�I�ll drive.�  Bob replied sardonically as he eyed the pair in the more than accommodating rearview mirror of the S-280.  �Just don�t you two go getting fresh on each other back there.�

�Don�t worry about us getting fresh back here bub.� Bing replied as he eyed Bob in the oversized rearview mirror.  �With my rotten intentions, nothing back here�s going to be fresh.�

<I>�I gotta drive while Mr. Charmer gets his way with the Princess.�</I> Bob muttered to himself while jamming the Mercedes into gear and easing out onto the street beyond the parking lot.  

As he did so, Bob noticed a number of paparazzi advancing upon the car from alleyways and side roads through the automatically adjustable side-view mirrors that come standard with the S-280.  They emerged from seemingly the most improbable of positions flanking the S-280 with Euro-sport economy sized vehicles and Mopeds on all sides.

�I think the calvery has arrived you two.�  Bob responded jamming his thumb towards the rear windshield of the S-280 that was lined with several defroster coils as standard equipment.

Bing turned, regarding the vehicles lining the S-280 as Bob pulled to a stop at a stoplight.  �Out run them fatter-than me.  We�ve got a Mercedes with a lot of power and fancy stuff and they have something like what you have between your ears.�  

The headlights of the paparazzo automobiles were muted when eyed through the pristinely tinted windows of the Mercedes.  While he did not know it, Bing appreciated the tinted glass of the S-280 even though it had cost upwards of $700 to have it customized in that way from the factory.  Bob appreciated it as well.

Smiling at the flashing cameras surrounding the vehicle, Bob rammed the car down into gear advancing onto the riverfront expressway.  While the S-280 can be upgraded to an automatic for $1,500 Bob could not understand the reasoning for it.  All Mercedes automobiles respond faithfully when shifted and, as he advanced through the gears to gain safety in the Alma Tunnel, Bob began appreciate the advanced horsepower of the S-280.

Nearing the tunnel's entrance Bing reached across the seat, gripping the Princesses taught hand and began to sing.

<I>�These are crazy days but they make me shine,�
�With a face like tubbies and a face like mine.�
�You will soon pass him by.�</I>

He sang, flashing his doe eyes at the princes.  The lights of the tunnel began to pass them by in sudden eruption of fluorescent brilliance as they entered its length.  

Continuing, Bing continued with his song.

<I>�All around the world.�
�All around the world.�
�It�s gonna be okay.�</I>

Suddenly, upon hearing Bing�s song, Bob dropped the steering wheel and climbed through the spacious interior of the S-280 toward the rear, kicking Dodi Fayed off the back passenger seat and inserting himself in between the Princess and Bing.  

�Please don�t cry and never say die you fink of a friend.�  Bob said regarding them both malevolently as the car spun ruthlessly out of control.  Turning his attentions towards the Princess, Bob asked:  �What is it about a guy like me and a girl like you?  Doesn�t this silly sap bore you?�  He said jamming his thumb in the direction of his friend.

�Well.�  The Princess began to say.  

Princess Di spoke her single last word simply and softly in her elegant way as the car lurched toward an embankment lining the tunnel.  Upon hearing her voice speak for the first time that night the entire car fell silent.  It was the single most beautiful sound that had been uttered in a millennium.   

Unfortunately it was to be the very last thing sound that Princess Di would ever make during her living life.

The Mercedes S-280 suddely swung 180 degrees as it slammed into a rouge pylon lining the center lane of the Alma Tunnel.  The force of the collision sent Bob and Bing flying through the rear collapsible window of the S-280.  Princess Di remained trapped inside the vehicle, bound by it�s superior seat belts.   Her ultimate lover, Dodi Fayed, whom had laid unconsciousness on the floor of the roomy Mercedes perished with her as, Bob and Bing were ejected upon a nearby wall upon their heads.

Traffic crawled to a stop along the Alma Tunnel and riverfront expressway as the police arrived.  Barricades were set up and paparazzi were escorted to jail as the frantically dying Lady Di was rushed to the hospital.  Time stood still around the attentions of a single Mercedes S-280 as the Paris fire marshals cut the victims loose from the wreckage that night with their claws of death.

<I>Meanwhile:</I>

�You okay?�  Bob asked, regarding Bing who stood from his inert position while continuously shaking his head.

�I�m okay as long as I don�t need to know my name.�  Bing responded cupping his friend by the shoulder.

�You haven�t known your name since I introduced you to Mia-Ties.�  Bob said returning Bing�s grip upon his shoulders.

�You keep bringing that movie up don�t you fat-so?�  Bing quipped.

�I keep telling you, the Road to Bali was a good film.�  Bob said as the pair sneaked off into oblivion.  �It was at least better than the Mercedes S-280 in a crash.� 

�That was some heck of a crash Bing.�  Bing said, hobbling off towards a service exit.

�I�m Bob.�  Bob reminded his friend as he escorted him past the screams of the Princes of Wales and her lover Dodi Fayed still trapped in the wreckage.  �I just hope that you�re not referring to The Road to Bali.�

�I�m referring to a lot of things.�  Bing concluded.  �You for one.�
