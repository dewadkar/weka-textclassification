            A friend once said, as he was trying to repair an old skateboard, �the only thing worse than not having a screwdriver is having something that is almost like a screwdriver.�  Stupid at first, but with a little thought I began to realize the depth of this passing comment.  Think about it, the only thing worse than not having something you really need (or want), is having something that is ALMOST like it.  

And so it goes with sports cars.  The only thing worse than not having a real sports car, is having a car that seems like it should be a serious sports car, but is not.  Saab has a rich racing and rally heritage, no problem there.  Saabs are quirky, and even in their 2-stroke days had a performance edge to them.  The top goes down, that is an essential element for a sports car.  Finally, many sports cars are expensive � surely Saab has no problem there.  Yet somehow the Saab 9-3 convertible misses the mark.  Where did it go so wrong?

Inside the 9-3 are all the usual features found on European sport/luxury cars,  leather, wood, sporty seats, trip computer, and full analog gauges � including a turbo boost gauge, it all seems to be there. The leather seats are comfortable enough, and come with 3 person memory.  Seating position is also comfortable. But many of the fancy buttons and switches are confusing and require extra time to master.  The driver information center is nice on a car this price, but it too is confusing and awkward to use, apparently the Swedes ain�t keen on ergonomics.  A glass rear window with defroster is a convertible lovers dream come true. And while the stereo/CD player sounds great, it would automatically revert to the radio each time I turned the car off.  I put a certain CD in the player, drive for 30 min., and then realize I really need a raspberry Snapple.  When I restart the car, I would expect to continue hearing my favorite Kylie Minogue tune � the one that was playing when I stopped.  But no!? Instead I hear the radio.  So now I have to press the CD button, then try to remember the track # of the song I WAS listening to.  And this happened each time I stopped the car.  For $43,000 they can do better.

While the stereo was a pain to use, the power top is a dream.  Undo one latch, hold a button down and let the mechanized symphony begin.  The top puts itself down and stores nicely under a hard plastic boot, then puts all the windows down.  This car looks great with the top down.

I cannot fault the car on looks, two neighbor girls mistook the Saab 9-3 for a Mercedes or BMW.  I would never put the Saab in that company (it drives the wrong wheels), but often the observations of the average consumer ring truer than a professional who knows cars inside and out.  This is by far one of the best looking convertibles at any price.

On the road the Saab 9-3 delivers more than adequate performance, and the power comes on strong with a quiet whoosh.  The turbocharged 4 cylinder is smooth and powerful, and the faint whine of the turbo kicking in is very gratifying.  205 hp doesn�t seem like a lot, but consider this is a 4 cylinder, many V-6�s are putting out near 200 hp, Saab does it with a smaller engine which gets better fuel economy.  The downside to all this power is excessive torque steer. Stomp the gas and the steering wheel yanks to the left.  This car has more torque steer than� well than a Saab.  The only car I can think of with more annoying and fun sapping torque steer is the Oldsmobile Intrigue with its 215 hp V-6. But wait it gets better, for over $43k you�ll get cowl shake too.  The Saab 93 has more cowl shake than a Fiat Spider � trust me on this one, I know.  Traveling over railroad tracks or any uneven pavement will cause the dash and windshield to shake.  It makes the car seem rather cheap. To the Saab�s credit, the ride is rather pleasant with the top up.  Only the underpowered VW Cabrio has a quieter cabin with the soft top up.  Cruising at highway speeds with the top up is not as tiring or tedious as in many other convertibles.  The ride is compliant and sporty, without being too harsh or firm.  Suspension is perfect for around town errands as well as open road travel � it has a civility that other sporty cars lack.

Where the Saab really fails is in its ability to deliver serious �bang-for-the-buck.�  Although I am not a big Camaro fan, I cannot help but admit that the Camaro SS delivers serious performance for under $30,000 � that is a high bang-for-the-buck ratio.  The Saab 9-3 SE convertible with the premium package, retails for barely under $44,000.  For $43k  I better get a freakin� shotgun bang-for-the-buck.  We�re talking Porsche territory here!

Overall the Saab 9-3 SE convertible is a reasonably fun and likeable car, though it seems a little small for the price.  The 9-3 is able to retain much of the 900�s quirkiness without looking odd. You�ll get a great engine that is fun to drive hard, yet is refined enough for everyday use, and the power top is pure genius (hope it never breaks). This is a beautiful car, if you want compliments, get one. Just don�t let them know how much you paid.  That is when the snickering begins.
