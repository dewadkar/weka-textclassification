            I received this camera as a Christmas gift and have had nothing but problems with it. Within the first week, the tabs on the plastic battery cover broke but I was still able to get it to close enough to still work. My dad had bought it for me so he gave me the receipt and I tried to exchange it. He paid $199 at OfficeMax. When I called the store to see if they had any in stock, they said they did not. They would only offer in store credit so I decided to keep the camera since they did not have anything comparable available. 

Since then, the battery cover broke completely so I was only able to take pictures if I used the AC adaptor to plug it in. I called Thompson to have it serviced and they said I had to return it and they would send me a new one. It was under warranty but they would not send me a new one until I returned the original (I paid shipping) and they charged me $20 for them to ship the new one after they received the original. My only other option was to give them a credit card number where the would hold $400 (the original price) until I returned the camera. Personally, I didn't trust them with my $400...

I received the new one after about 4 weeks. It worked fine for about a month and then it just froze up. I couldn't turn it off, couldn't do anything with it. I called the service number (long distance) and was on hold for 30 minutes. They told me I needed to "reset" the camera. This fixed it for a short time. In the next couple of months, I had to reset the camera another 4 times. Keep in mind that it wipes out the memory card and all the pictures on it when it froze (so have a blank back-up you can swap). 

Well, it has frozen up again and apparently I've reached the reset limit because it won't reset anymore. Once again, I called the service number. I explained that it is no longer under warranty and asker where I could get it serviced. I was given 2 locations. I hopped in my car (it's June, it's Texas, it's 1pm, it's hot, and my AC isn't working) and drove 20 miles to the camera repair shop. They told me they don't work on digital cameras only camcorders. They called another camera shop for me and were told that if it's not under warranty, nobody services it. Sure enough, I called every camera shop in the yellow pages and NOBODY will touch it. 

My only option now is to return it to the manufacturer (Thomson Multimedia) and allow them to put a $400 hold on my credit card while they "fix" it. NO THANKS! I have a better chance of fixing it myself....I'm now looking for a tiny screwdriver....

Now, if the pictures were a good quality it might be worth letting them try to fix it but they aren't very good unless you have perfect lighting...

This camera is the worst product I have EVER seen or had the misfortune to own. 

I feel worse for my dad because he was very excited about the gift.
