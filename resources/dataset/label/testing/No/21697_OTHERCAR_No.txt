            I have noted the following problems with my 95 honda passport 6 cyl, manual tranny, rear wheel drive:

1.  The mechanism that drives the power windows snaps off at the most inopportune times (torrential rains/blizzard).  
The windows then making a terrible crunching noise and jam at half mast.  It then costs over $300 to repair each mechanism.  I am told they are made of plastic (not a smart idea).

2.  The door and door locks constantly jam and freeze making the passenger side doors functional approximately 50% of the time (and that number is dropping).  I have made many visits to the mechanic on this one.

3.  The engine hesitates and lugs enough to violently shake your coffee into your lap at around 2000-3000 rpms in 3rd gear.  You have to practically red line it before shifting.  Very annoying if you are used to driving something like a saab 900. Many trips to the mechanic on this one.  Went through the fuel system/timing with a fine tooth comb.  Have tried cleaning, etc.  No luck yet. 

4.  The brakes constantly need repair.

5.  Initially, reliability was a problem until changing spark plugs, wires.  Now the battery and brake light is on.  After replacing battery and checking alternator, my mechanice informs me that it is something in the circuitry that will have to be handled by the dealer (NO WAY! i'll use the strategically placed electrical tape method before I sink any hard earned $$$ into this vehicle).
