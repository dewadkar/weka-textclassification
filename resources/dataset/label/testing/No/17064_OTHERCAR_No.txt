            MY warranty just ran out 2 weeks ago.  I would like to share my experiences (chronologically) with this car over the last three years for current and future owners.

June 1997 � Purchased car.  1.8T (2 wheel drive, Sport Package, Cold Weather Package, Convenience Package, Computer, Bose Stereo, Disc Changer)

March 1998 (11,000 mi) � Starting hearing a creaking sound from front right corner of the car.  Turns out to be a broken upper stabilizer bar.  Replaced by the dealer under warranty.  

April 1998 (12,000 mi) � Another �creaking� sound this time from front right corner of the car.  Turns out to be the same problem as the previous month, but on the other side. Replaced by the dealer under warranty.

June 1998 (15,000 mi) � Installed a chip to boost turbo pressure along with a after market air filter.  Great performance, except a more pronounced torque steer, especially in wet conditions.  

July 1998 (16,500 mi) � The car started to feel sluggish once in while.  After a while, it started to feel sluggish all the time.  It turns out the turbo died and lost boost pressure due to failed waste gate controller (controller that controls turbo pressure). Replaced by the dealer under warranty, but after a two week waiting time as the turbos were on back order.  (Note:  to this day, I do not know whether the computer chip was the reason the turbo failure.  The �doctored� computer module indicated errors at the dealer, so the dealer gave me a new computer module.  As the module was replaced, I have been running a normal chip which has not given me any trouble)

March 2000 (31,000 mi) � The car was flooded (???) and it would not start!!!!  I have heard of the car flooding (may be a computer glitch) after the car is started and turned off within a minutes and then attempted to start again.  The battery died after attempting to start again.  Called a tow truck thru the Audi 24/7 roadside assistance and the car started right up with a jump start.  (I think this was a combination of the flooding and a weak battery � Audi�s maintenance program excludes battery.)  

May 2000 (34,000 mi) � Radio started to pick up a lot of static only in AM band.  Probably a loose ground wire.  The dealer replaced the whole unit under warranty.  

July 2000 (37,500 mi) � Lost all clutch pressure.  The pedal went into the floor and did not come back up.  Probably a failed slave or master cylinder.   In the dealer currently being fixed.  Have not heard from the dealer as to the exact diagnosis of the problem. 

As you can see I have mixed feelings about this car.  When it�s running well, it runs well and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  Also, as you can see, I did not have any problem for about a year and a half from the latter half of 1998 through 2000.  It has not been trouble free over the last three years, and I am not sure I can recommend this car to others, especially as a used car going into its third year.  These problems could be unique to this car as my car is one of the first 1.8T�s produced.  I am sure it takes a while to �iron out� problems.  Of course, I could have only been unlucky or is this number of problems par with this model???.
