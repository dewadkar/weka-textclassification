            I bought this car for $1500 right after i had sold my Saturn.  I bought it from a Russian gentleman who had been holding it for his friend and he didnt want it anymore.  It had been sitting in the parking lot for a few months.  My dad and I had to end up replacing the clutch, all of the brake pads, rotors, valve cover gasket, some bearings, and many more things.  After we repaired it, it ran fine for a few months until one night during the winter when i was taking a friend home, it stopped all of a sudden in the middle of the street for no apparent reason.  I couldnt get it to start and looked at everything and didnt notice anything wrong.  Welp we got it home and my dad found that the fuel pump fuse had blown and ever since that day, its been downhill and nothing but.  Pure hell, i've had no luck with it what so ever.  It worked again for a week or so and bam, the fuse blew again and i got stuck @ work, about 20 miles away from home.  Dad did his magic again and still, fuse after fuse it stops.  We replaced the ignition switch, fuse pump relay, and even fuel pumps.  Nothing has worked.  It'll sit around, then work for a week, and then act up again.  We took it to a mechanic and he couldnt do anything about it.  Dont get me wrong, its a great car and i love it but this little electrical problem is a big mess.  It has great features like sunroof, 6 speaker stereo system, alarm, a/c, tilt, cruise, central lock system, HUGE trunk, very roomy and comfortable bucket seats in front and back, and a fast 4 cylinder 2.0 L 5 speed manual engine and tranny.  I dont know about other people when they say first gear is a slow start, mine is fast in all gears, specially 5th.  I go average about 115-120 mph on the interstate easily. They make it look so hard on the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious. The gas mileage is alright from what i've seen.  Mine kind of sucks since my timing belt is off, so it burns a little more.  German engines last forever.  I have about 140,000 miles on my car and i havent had a oil change yet and the car had 135,000 miles when i got it.  It runs great no matter what.  No engine problems what so ever, and German cars are know for that since my family is big into German cars.  When we replaced the clutch, it was the factory one still and it was still very usuable, barely worn down.  the problem was the master cylinder.  I dont have a problem with rust what so ever and i live in Iowa where there is a lot of snow.  The interior has everything you need.  Bucket seats, cloth seats, glovebox, easy to use knobs and buttons, and one solid car underneath you.
