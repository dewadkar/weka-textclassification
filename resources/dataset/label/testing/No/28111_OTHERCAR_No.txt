            I bought this camera, quite frankly, because I wanted a digital camera and didn't want to spend big bucks.  Walmart had it on sale for under $190 last November (1999) and I decided to try it.

We moved in '99 and were no longer near our my family.  I wanted a camera for quick snapshots to email home to my parents and friends.  The Polaroid seemed like a good way to achieve this.

First of all, let me say that the quality is actually pretty decent.  Even after I've compressed the jpegs some, they still look pretty good.  Of course, the Sony Mavica that our office uses for taking pictures at construction sites is much better and much easier to get the pictures from.  The process of downloading from the Polaroid is a bit cumbersome.  I have a PDA that uses the serial port and the Polaroid needs it, too.  If I buy another camera, it'll be USB.

If you take many pictures with the Polaroid, it takes a LONG time to download through the serial port.  But the software that's packaged with it is very useful.  I can export the pictures to my desktop and have them ready to email in a matter of seconds.

Whatever you do, buy many batteries or stay near an outlet if you need to use this camera for an extended length of time.  The batteries go quickly.  I haven't had a chance to try the new &quot;titanium&quot; batteries that Energizer sells to see if they live up to their claims, though.  I'm sure this camera will prove if they are telling the truth.

The body of the camera is (for me) shaped nicely.  It fits my hand very well.  The color screen on the back of the camera is a nice feature...provided the batteries are charged well.  My brother-in-law bought another brand at about the same time and paid nearly the same amount and it has no preview screen.  Bonus...

I'd say that this camera is good for it's price range.  Don't buy it if you're planning to take photos for your local newspaper, though.  You'll be disappointed.  If you want a camera to replace a standard 35mm setup, save up for the more expensive and higher-quality brands.<br><br>
