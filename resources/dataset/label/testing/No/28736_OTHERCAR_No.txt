            I bought my '92 Eclipse because of it's sporty looks. I was a teen when I bought it, so I didn't do much research on it  beforehand.
That was a big mistake. Since then I have had to completely replace the automatic transmission (after the warranty ran out), which cost me close to $2000. Also, the engine mounts loosened and the car bangs going from park to drive. The manual windows are very hard to roll up and down. The passenger side lap belt locked up and had to be to replaced, and the shoulder belt has been known to go too far back and trap the passenger in the seat. The hydrolic for the hatchback door lost pressure and had to be replaced. It starts to shake at about 65 mph, and there is very little room for more than 2 passengers.
