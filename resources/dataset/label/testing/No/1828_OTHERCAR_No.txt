            Is it a wonder that Mazda discontinued this car?? The MX-6 looks good and takes curves really well but that's about it.  

As far as design, it may look good but it is the most inefficient use of space created in the automobile industry.  It's a 2-door "sportscar" that is as long as a 4-door Lexus with no room in the back for passengers.  The trunk is spacious but the opening is so small that you can't possibly fit bigger objects in it even though it could hold it. There is only one cup-holder, one very small side pocket on the drivers side and a small glove compartment.  Even the Mazda folio with the manual doesn't fit!!

Concerning the engine, it doesn't run well in the city but on the freeway look out! I take this to the shop for regular maintenance however, the first month I had it the water pump went out ("that shouldn't have happened" said Mazda), the transmission went out after only 50K miles -- something my mechanic says should NEVER happen. I've talked to other MX6 owners and they have had the same transmission problems.  The weatherstripping is falling off (maybe that's climatic as I live in SF?).  When discussing all these issues with Mazda's customer service, they were less than helpful and downright rude.  My brother who designs automobiles for a living told me, next time stick with Honda, Toyota or BMW.  They think about all the things that Mazda did not think about in the design of this car.
