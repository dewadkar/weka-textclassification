            The Volvo V70 is a good, small, family car for in-town commuting and errands.  The great turning radius is the shortest of any vehicle we've ever owned.  But, the car's limited passenger space is a detriment for longer trips.  

The big watch-out for this and other Volvo models is getting warranty work performed.  After a company relocation, we are now living in a area where there are no Volvo dealerships or warranty-approved mechanics for over 125 miles.  All scheduled maintenance on Volvo cars must be performed by warranty dealers, or the the warranty is worthless.  

The problem is that there aren't Volvo dealerships everywhere.  There are huge gaps in their dealership coverage.  Major metro markets are okay, but towns under 200,000 aren't likely to have a dealership. Since we cannot get this car fixed where we now live, we are trading the car in on a different make and model, losing money in the process. We bought the car for the safety and reliability reputation.  But, we never expected that we would move and not be able to have repairs done.  Ford, Volvo's parent company, cannot provide warranty service through their dealerships.<br><br>
