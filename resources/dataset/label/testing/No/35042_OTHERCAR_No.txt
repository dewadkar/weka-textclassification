            Of the 4 BMW's I've owned, this is the only one assembled in the U.S. and I do believe that that shows.  It is entirely possible that since I bought one of the first ones available, that the car hadn't been around long enough for the quarks to have been worked out at the factory.  I won't be buying another American-built Bimmer to find out either.  I started experiencing numerous problems within the first month of ownership and problems continue to surface.  The worst of it is that the service department at BMW - at least in my most recent experience - has a 180-degree difference in attitude toward the customer than they're magnificent sales team.  After having numerous e-mails being ignored, I CC'd my requests and dissatisfaction to the owner of the dealership.  That seemed to really stir things up, which I was glad to see, but not without some backlash.  That's right, even BMW isn't above spitting in my food when it's sent back to the cook.  When I brought my car in for service, I was pulled aside by the Service Manager and coerced into being a teamplayer if I wanted service.  Bunch of whiny cry-babies.  When I got the call from the independent survey company, I tried to be fair, but according to the scoring criteria, they rightfully deserved zeros across the board.  

So what problems have I had?  The ones that come to mind:
-a "metallic" swirling sound when turning the steering wheel in 2nd gear.
-a black out of my guages
-a non-responsive throttle (possibly drive by wire technology computer problems)
-oil light that comes on despite having only 6000 miles on it and having "full" for oil
-a "click" when the driver's side window at half-way point on its way down
-a "clicking" from the CD player when the car door opens
-the autotop occassionally locks either while still in the down position or in half position

I drive the 2.5i, not the 3.0i.  A mistake, but not a big one.  Even the 3.0i would be a mistake.  This is a sports car, right?  At best, 0-60 is accomplished in 5.9 seconds (3.0).  A Dodge Neon (R/T) can do it in 5.4 whereas my 2.5i does it in 6.9.  I'm sure there are many many other cheaper cars that will run circles around any Z4, granted without the high quality in materials and level of sophistication in technology and creature comforts.  So DO NOT BUY A Z4 if speed is a major factor.  Though it is leagues ahead of the Z3, it still misses the mark against the aging Porsche Boxster.  Sorry, no points for 2nd place.  This car is for cruising around or taking on the corners, showing off the roundel and enjoying the sun.  This is not a true sports car.  Wait till the M Roadster makes its way back.  Certainly a 3.2 engine or hopefully even a 4.6 or 4.8 V8 from the X5 would do this beauty of a car good.
