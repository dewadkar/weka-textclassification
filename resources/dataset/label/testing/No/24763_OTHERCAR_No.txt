            Olympus&#146 Camedia C 720 is the updated version of the popular Olympus digital series. The camera is targeted at an audience who wants the ability to be in the digital age with some advanced features of a professional camera with the options of falling back on automatic features.  It is also for those who might like to capture a quick movie and those who have extreme zoom envy.

The viewfinder included in this camera is great concept which allows one to view from the traditional eye piece or the LCD display, both which are electronic.  The downfall is the slow refresh rate.

Exposure 

The C 720 offers an wide range of exposure options including Program mode for point-and-shoot in most picture situations and scene modes for fully automatic exposures optimized like Portrait, Landscape, Night-Low light, and Sports shots. The C 720&#146s advanced settings include aperture priority, shutter priority, and manual mode for more experienced photographers who want more exposure control. The inconsistancy with each setting make it near impossible to tell what is for what for even the advanced user as even the smallest change in light upsets the camera's ability to focus or capture any real color.  Even with the MY MODE option, where one can save their own preferences, it's nothing more than another crap shoot option (pardon the pun)  The metering system, which is either in spot metering, or in digital seems to work well.  Again the downfall of this is it needs to be premeditated <b>per shot</b> and has no real use for the candid photo.

When using a rechargable battery system I have gotten the full use of a 128 chip plus some extra.  Please don't cheap out on disposable batteries as you will be sorely disappointed with the hour or so of life you will get from them.  The camera is meant to be used with a rechargable system.

All in all this camera was a real let down, and a wate of money. I have noticed that the slow shutter speed has nopt been compensated for in newer models.  Despite the lack of zoom, (which is my main envy point) I would stick to a PHD (push here dummy) digital camera for a few years more until the bugs are worked out a little better.

SMART MEDIA CHIP - <b>outdated system!! xD is the new line.</b>
