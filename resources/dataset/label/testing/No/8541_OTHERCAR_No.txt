            I fell in love with the styling in the showroom (I was actually with my mother who also thought it was a beautiful car)I admit I did enjoy the test ride but they kept it short. I had always wanted a convertible and this one looked as nice as any. I immediately noticed upon buying the sebring the lackluster power for a 6 cylinder. It has a very jarring gear box which can actually spill a cup of coffee from 2nd to 3rd gear, I feel the gear ratios are far too high for this engine. I think the car tends to rattle due to a loose fitting ragtop which likes to shimmy over a rough road. Maybe this is a good convertible for someone young getting into the convertible market but having driven a lot of nice cars I think this was a definite step backwards. I would not recommend this vehicle to any car officianado. I am looking forward to getting rid of this car so that I can purchase something else next year<br><br>
