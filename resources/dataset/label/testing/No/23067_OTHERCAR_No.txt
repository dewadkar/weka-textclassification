            I bought this camera thinking wow, this looks like a great camera for a great price.  I took it home and started snapping away at my kids, my wife, anything.  

Then after a few shots (about 15) the flash wouldn't work.  To make sure, I changed the setting to forced flash.  And it didn't work.  Frustrated, I set it aside, and came back to it about an hour later.  The flash worked this time.

After a week of fighting the flash to work after about 15 photos I decided to exchange it for another one.  The second PDC 640 I bought was even worse.  If it flashed after the third shot the flash was so dull, I might as well have not even used it.<br><br>
