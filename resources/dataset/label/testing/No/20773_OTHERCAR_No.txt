            I am a cautious and knowledgeable shopper.  So when I became interested in purchasing a digital camera as a Christmas present, I shopped for a good quality digital camera that was easy to operate for the best price.  I liked the Sony P51's features and liked Sony's renown quality,and settled on Circuit City as the best place to buy it.

I inquired about the Sony warranty at Circuit City and was told that Sony digital cameras had a 3 month warranty.  When I asked about such a short warranty problem, I was told that this was the industry average, and that if the camera were to break down, it would be when it was first used.  The salesperson tried to sell me an extended warranty, but as I thought I was familiar with the quality of Sony products, I elected to not purchase it.

I purchased the camera at Circuit City prior to Christmas, and since we were away for the holidays, it wasn't until January that we got to use it.  I took 100 pictures with it, and it worked absolutely flawlessly.  We took a trip when the Sony was less than 3 months old (from January) and when I went to use the Sony it froze, nothing worked, the lens cover stayed open, and I disgustedly stuck it in my pocket!  Upon arrival home, I again tried it with new batteries and fiddled with it, and it worked fine!  And I took 10 pictures or so just to make sure! 

A month later we were on a trip and I again tried the Sony, and it again froze and wouldn't work!  Upon arriving home, I tried the Sony phone number that Circuit City provided me with, and tried via the Internet to contact Sony, and all I got was a lot of automated messages, and/or, phone numbers of authorized repair shops who couldn't or wouldn't do warranty repairs.

I fiddled around for another month or so trying to figure a way out of my dilemma, and happened on a Ritz camera store.  The Ritz salesmen talked with me at length about my problem - even though he knew he was wasting his time - and advised that I call their Sony phone number.

The good news?  I called Sony and finally got a real live person.  The bad news?  The Sony rep was VERY adamant about Sony's 3 month warranty, and said I was beyond it, and would have to pay $139.00 to have my Sony Cyber-shot 2.0 P51 digital camera repaired!  

I tried to explain the events herein to him but he stated, "your Sony Cyber-shot is out of warranty - period!"  I asked to speak with his manager, and he said he was the manager!  I told the Sony rep that I would write such things as I am now writing, and he told me to go ahead and do it!  So here I am!

I found the people at Ritz Camera to be knowledgeable and friendly people!  Should I do any shopping for camera's, Ritz is where I will go.  It was at Ritz camera that I discovered the 3 month "industry average warranty for digital camera's" is NOT the "industry average!"  There is a lot of GREAT digital camera's out there with a full one year warranty!  (Not a one year parts only add on gimmick to round out a half baked 90 day warranty!)  

So look around!  Should you decide to purchase a Sony digital camera, be VERY sure to purchase the longest extended warranty you can find.
