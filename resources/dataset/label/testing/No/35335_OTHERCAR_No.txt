            <i>This van was given to us as a gift from my husbands mother after his father died.  He bought it new along with all the amenities that come with a luxury vehicle.  It is a <b>1996 Chrysler Town and Country LXI van.</b></i>

<b>This</b> van Has a 3.8Liter engine V6 with a 4 speed Auto transmission. The steering wheel can be moved up or down for your driving comfort.

The seats are leather and both of the front passenger seats have automatic controls that let you go up or down back or forward.  The seats also recline into a position where with a pillow you could snooze for quite a while.  The seating will seat 7 or 8 comfortably.  The seat's behind the front are both bucket seats with arm rests and cup holders on the side.

The rear seat is one long seat. With three seat belts. All of these seats are removable.  To remove the seats you pull the levers on the back of each one on the floor.  That part is okay.  <b>However, the seats are heavy and awkward to move and take more then one person if you are a woman.</b>

The heater and AC has duel controls that allows driver and passenger to individually adjust the comfort level to their own comfort. 

The stereo system is top of the line but the sound is not that great to me, maybe it is just my hearing.  There is a CD player and cassette player with the stereo.

The buttons are already starting to stick and doesn't want to tune in the radio station you have programed in.

It has a remote entry and  which means you can lock or unlock from a distance. There is also a panic button which works even in the house. I found this out when my grandson mashed the red button to see what it would do. The alarm system activates when you lock the car outside.

<b>Feature's I like</b>

The doors lock automatically when you reach a speed of 15 miles an hour.  

The lights stay on at night for about 3 minutes after you leave the car which helps when you are going into a dark house.

There is a little screen on the top of the dash between the two visors that has these functions.

You can see how much gas is left in the vehicle.  This is very acurate and has been reliable.

What direction you are going and the outside temperature.

You can program in a trip and it lets you know how many miles you have been.



<b>This is a list of the problems that have occurred with the van.</b>

1.  Driver side sliding door lock inoperable with remote,  Caused by some kind of deposits on the contacts.  Parts were ordered and both sides were repaired.

2. Again a problem with the doors not opening and Latch assembly had to be installed.

3. Left Rear door trim piece loose.  This was corrected. It is loose again 4 years later.

4.  Turn signals don't work intermittently. There was a problem three times with this before they finally corrected the problem.

5.  Every once in a while try to start and nothing happens, after trying a few times it would eventually start.  They replaced the battery.  This is still going on 4 years later, it is not the battery.

6.  A problem with the passenger door again.  Repaired, said it was a wire pulled out.

7.  Again the directional signals did not work properly, they could not find the problem at that time.

8.  Left slider door hard to open and close sometimes.  They lubricated the door.

9.  Left slider door does not unlock.  Repaired the latch linkage.

10. Directional signals again inoperable at times. They still could not duplicate the problem

11. Left slider door again refuses to open, this time they replace the latch and linkage assembly.

12. Transmission leak.  They redid the transmission service.

13. The signals refused to work again.  This time they finally found connector to signal switch making intermittent connection. Fixed the switch.

14. Turn signals again.  This time they found a shorted switch, removed and replaced the switch.

15. Radiator fan doesn't come on. Fan relay shorted, removed and replaced.

16. Gas tank leak when full.  Gas tank replaced.

17. Still a problem with directional signals( you think there might be a ghost in this van) couldn't duplicate the problem.

18. Drivers side sliding door panel loose again. Replaced the interior window frame.

The problems above this all happened when they first bought the van.  This is what happened after we got the van with 42000 miles on it.

19.  Water pump leaking.  Replaced.

20.  Struts leaking and weak.  Replaced.

21.  This is the one I had a hard time believing.  The transmission went out and had to be replaced at only 42000 miles

22.  The transmission was leaking again. Fixed.

23.  They had to replace the brakes and belts.

24.  There was a problem with the car shimming when driving.  Had to take it in 3 different times before they found the problem.

25.  Had to replace the water pump again.

It seems to me that this should have been returned as a lemon.  When we finally  received the van it was too late for this.

The van drives like a dream, handles the corners well and I enjoy driving when there is nothing wrong with it. 

The plastic components in this van appear to be cheap and are always popping and cracking.  I mentioned to my husband the other day that for a top of the line van and as much money as it cost, this was ridiculous.  

There was also 3 recalls for specific things to be repaired. 

Backing into a post at about 1 mile an hour crushed the drivers side rear door and caused 1100.00 worth of damage, it felt like a soda can being crushed.

Backing up in poor light with the back windows tinted is sometimes tricky.
