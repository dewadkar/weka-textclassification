            We purchased a Jeep Cherokee Sport in March of 1997 and have been anxious to sell it ever since.  Once the novelty of having the vehicle wore off, we began to despise our purchase.  About two months into owning it we began to have brake problems, which have been fixed numerous times now.  My husband's parents purchased a Grand Cherokee Laredo about the same time as we purchased our vehicle, and they too have had several problems with their brakes - coincidence?  When we went to take our first trip which required luggage, we realized that we didn't have as much cargo space as we had once thought.  As a result, whenever we travel, we throw a luggage carrier on top of the truck.  Despite all of this, I think that my biggest complaint would have to be that while you believe that you are paying for some luxury, the Jeep Cherokee, like the Wranglers are almost strictly utilitarian.  They offer a horribly uncomfortable ride, and yelling is almost necessary to be heard while travelling at speeds above 55 miles per hour.  Thankfully we only have one small child, because he pretty much consumes the tiny backseat area.  There really is no room for adults to sit comfortably in the backseat, I know because I have tried.  We are looking forward to selling it this spring!<br><br>
