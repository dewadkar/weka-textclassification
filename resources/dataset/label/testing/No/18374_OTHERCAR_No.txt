            I'm now on my second Hyundai- not because I'm loyal to the breed, but because when I tried trading my Elantra, the dealers all laughed and offered me much less than I owed! The only way to come close to breaking even was to buy another Hyundai.  

Ok, let's face facts.  This review is written by a woman who only knows how to check oil, put air in tires, and fill the gas tank.  If you want engine size or horsepower, you can stop right here.  I can only tell you the good and the bad points as I know them. 
 
Let's start on the positive side.  The Hyundai Tiburon is cute.  Its got that sporty look that you just can't seem to find anymore. People turn to look at the car. For a small car, the front seats are fairly roomy and comfortable.  If you drop the back seats and use the hatchback, there's plenty of room for hauling large items.  The controls are all easy to use.  Though its got that rough &quot;small car&quot; feel, its still fun to drive.  

Hyundai offers an excellent warrantee... which leads me to the negative side... this car NEEDS an excellent warrantee!  I've had my Tiburon for a year and a half and have had it in for warrantee work 4 times so far, and two of the problems still haven't been fixed.  During the first 6 months I had the car, the &quot;check engine&quot; light would come on for no apparent reason.  After two visits to the service shop it stopped.  I can't put gas in the tank unless its less than half full.  They put a new vented thingamajig in the opening to the gas tank, but it didn't solve the problem.  The pump nozzle acts as if the tank is full and cuts off.  If I try to continue filling the tank, the gas backs up and splashes down the side of the car. I can't open the trunk using the trunk release lever inside the car- it doesn't release.  It was supposedly fixed, but I can still only open the trunk with the key.  My rear window wiper stopped working several months ago.  I haven't had it fixed yet because I just don't have the patience to drive an hour to the nearest dealer, then sit for several hours while they claim to fix it.  

All 4 of my tires have gone flat at least 3 times each.  I've had them checked by two different chains specializing in tires/auto repairs and was told by both that there's nothing wrong with the tires.  I now carry a portable air compressor that plugs into a cigarette lighter.  But, lo and behold, it doesn't fit into my Hyundai's cigarette lighter.  So when my tires go flat I have to ask someone to pull up next to me so I can use their cigarette lighter!

Maybe I've just been very unlucky, but I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone who doesn't have the patience of a saint.<br><br>
