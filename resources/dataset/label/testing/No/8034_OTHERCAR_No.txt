            I recently came into the possession of a used 1992 Saturn SL1, and I have been very disappointed with this car.  First of all it's not the sportiest looking car, even though it was probably stylish at the time it's just not the best looking car.  The insides are very small, I have trouble getting in and out of this car and when I'm inside there is hardly any room to move around in the front and I almost don't fit in the back.  Another problem with the interior of this car is that there is not a cup holder or even room to install one, I have tried.  The engine is a very tiny four cylinder and offers very little horsepower, and it is a front wheel drive car.  When I got the car I was disappointed in finding out that the moon roof did not work, and neither did the air conditioning.  The cars alternator went bad within two months after I bought the car, so I had to get that fixed and get a new battery, and almost immediatley after I fixed that, the transmission died, I have not gotten this fixed yet because I don't have the $1500 plus labor to get this taken care of.  The one thing that I really like about this car is that it is a very small gas tank only taking $12 to fill up and it gets decent gas mileage for a nine year old car.  Also I like the fact that the rear seats fold down into the trunk giving you a lot of extra trunk space, I can fit my bmx bike in there and get the trunk closed when I take my bike down to the park.  Overall these are the only good things about this car.  I bought this car because I was told they were very reliable by numerous friends, and my Grandparents own a 1992 Saturn SL1 also.  I would reccomend buying a newer Saturn or at least taking a better look at the car before you buy it.
