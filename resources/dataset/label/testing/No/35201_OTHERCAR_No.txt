            Now that we've driven our new 1999 Toyota 4Runner for 4 months, I feel better qualified to judge the car's pro's and cons. The car has a number of annoying irritations which, although not amounting to much separately, do take the fun out of driving it.

 My number one complaint is the non-illuminated LCD display window of the odometer. There is no way to turn up the brightness for better visibility. Unless the sun shines directly onto the panel, one cannot read it. What good is having 3 separate displays built into it (odometer, trip meter I and trip meter II) when you cannot read a single one of them? Toyota has been building cars for a long time. Can't they do better? What were they thinking?
 Secondly, this car is designed for small people. There is not enough headroom and not enough elbow room which makes it awkward for long distance driving. 3) The gas tank is too small and necessitates frequent refueling stops. 4) The gas door release lever should be identified better, preferably by an easily visible yellow color and &quot;touchy-feely&quot; design; one always opens up the hood by mistake.

In general, this car is very......annoying. It is not convienent at all, and if I had the chance to buy another SUV, I would have bought another<br><br>
