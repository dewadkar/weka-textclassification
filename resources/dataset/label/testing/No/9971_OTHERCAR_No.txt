            After years of dreaming of the SL in my garage, I opted to lease an SLK in August '99.  So far I have not had the &quot;warm fuzzies&quot;.   Within hours of my taking posession, the convertible top stopped working.  I was told by the service department that the 99 models had fiber optics trouble, after Mercedes changed vendors.  My particular car had to have all the fiber optics completely replaced.  It took three separate sessions and they had it for all but three days of my first month of ownership.  Then the door panels came apart - and again the service department disclosed to me that this is happening &quot;all the time&quot; in these cars.  Then the CD player stopped working - fiber optics again!  Then the fuel gauge - you guessed it.  Then the rear window began to rattle and the pop out cup holder broke.
I truely can not recommend anyone purchase this car.  My SLk is in the dealership being repaired more than its in my own garage.  To top it off, every time something breaks, I have to pay the dealership to obtain a &quot;loaner car&quot; for the day.  All repairs take several trips to the dealership and several car rentals, before the problem is &quot;supposedly&quot; fixed.

Don't do it!<br><br>
