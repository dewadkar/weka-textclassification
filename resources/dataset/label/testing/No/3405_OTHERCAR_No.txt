            Looking over the &quot;opinions&quot; of others - I've got to say most are right on target with this car, although most are driving newer models.  The 2nd gen of this car is awesome in MY opinion - compared to the 1st gen, but Mitsubishi is not the company who should be building them.  As a whole their dealer network, service provided, and quality control rate down there with the Yugo and early Hyundais.
If your going to buy a 3000GT, buy the VR-4 - sure it costs a whole lot more, but you'll never get the thrill and experience if you were to buy a base (why do they even make these things) or an SL.  With the Base and SL, all you are buying is the looks and styling.  The VR-4 will blow most everything away in the long run (short runs, it's too heavy) and you put it on a twisty backroad and you'll kiss those Stangs, Vettes, and Beemers good-bye.  The twisty is the 3000's territory and it'll make you think about your driving with all-wheel steering and all-wheel drive.
The 1st Gen car, especially the manuals suffer a synchronizer problem and about the only way to fix it is to buy a new/rebuilt tranny from Mitsu for about $5G's (this isn't a joke - Mitsu DOES NOT REPAIR these trannies - the same for 2nd gen 6-speeds as well).  The VR-4 goes thru valve adjustments / replacements like someone with ulcers goes thru stomach medicine.  Tack on $600 for that task.
Overall though, if you've got the money to buy one of these cars (VR-4 only), then you should have the money to fix it as well and you'll never regret the purchase if you take good care of her.<br><br>
