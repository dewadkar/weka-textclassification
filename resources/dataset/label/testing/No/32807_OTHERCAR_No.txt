            I have never been an aunt or a Godparent, but that is sort of how I feel about my friend�s 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier.  That may sound funny, but I have been there since the day it was born.  Well, since it was �adopted�.  I tagged along with her to the car lots, listened to her hopes and dreams, discussed haggling strategies.  Buying a car is a big decision.  You hope it will be healthy, and you hope it will be with you for a long time.

The Cavalier boasted a terrific track record.  Neither one of us knew a whole lot about cars.  Since most of our knowledge came from the school of hard knocks and pings, anything that promised low maintenance sounded wonderful.  Although just a two door, it was still pretty roomy.   Not so much legroom in the back, but you could put four people in the seats, ample junk in the trunk, and a mountain bike on top. 

What really caught our attention was how many items were included in the standard package: anti-lock brakes, dual air bags, reinforced steel doors.  It had a surprising amount of horsepower, and no, it did not hurt a bit that it was sporty looking and cute to boot.  She bought it and cheerfully drove it home.

Over the past five years she has been very happy with the Cavalier.  It is a very comfortable car that rides well and suits her zip-around-town lifestyle.  She kept up with the regular oil changes, and up until this year the only real repairs were replacing the serpentine belt twice (about $70 each time) and some brake work.  The air conditioning was not cooling any more, and she was going to have that checked out.  It still looked great, and even though I was happy with my Ford Contour, I started to ponder getting one for myself some day.

Maybe it was fate, or perhaps just my bad luck that I was with her when it started acting out scenes from the Exorcist.  We were on our way to a conference, and an hour into the drive when it began.  Driving along about 60mph, whenever the car would slow to 30mph or less because of traffic or stop signs it would stall and just die.  It could not be restarted unless it was in neutral, and then after bucking and kicking, it would sort of shoot off like a rocket.  Heading into rush hour, this was a nightmare.  On the way back it waited another hour and then started again, making it a white-knuckle ride all the way.

When she returned home, she thought she won the lottery. Chevrolet had just recalled that model because their faulty Powertrain Control Modules were causing the cars to stall and they, �may not be able to be restarted.�  She took it to a Chevy dealership and it was replaced at no charge.

Later, one hour away from home, it started all over again.  She took it back to the dealership three times, always to be told that nothing was wrong with it.  She narrowly escaped a $68 diagnostic fee by asserting that they had not actually diagnosed anything.  Then she called the Chevrolet 800 number twice, was on hold for 30-40 minutes each time, and never did speak with a human.  

Since my parents live near the dealership where she actually bought the vehicle, I loaned her my car and drove the Cavalier over there.  Travel took an hour, so I made quite an entrance trying to steer the stalling carcass into the repair shop.  They diagnosed the problem right away (for $68) and said that the PCM recall took care of what occurs when the engine gets cool and damp, but the current problem is with the Torque Converter Solenoid which is what goes wrong when it gets hot and dry.  Having done a bit of newsgroup searching on the Internet, this was in line with what numerous others with the exact same problem had been claiming.  Except it didn�t end there.  They heard a tick-tick-ticking noise coming from the timing chain (all I could hear was  $$cha-ching$$), and said that the head gasket had blown and was shooting smutz all over everything.  It wasn�t pretty.

The grand total?  $1400.  Gasp. Choke.  Wheeze.  I did feel that, unlike with dealership number one, these guys at least knew what they were doing.  But $1400?!  Yikes!  I thought that when I relayed the news my friend might very well blow a gasket herself.  She took it about as well as one could, faced with the decision of whether or not it is worth repairing versus the reality of purchasing an all-new, unplanned automobile.  

She decided to have the repair work done, but the Cavalier is not looking like so much of a value as it once did.  What remains to be seen is what happens next.  Now that so many things have been fixed, will it stay that way?  Is it time to start shopping for a replacement?  

I suggested she forego cars all together and consider getting a rickshaw.  It could be the beginning of a profitable enterprise-- chauffeuring people to and from the dealership.
