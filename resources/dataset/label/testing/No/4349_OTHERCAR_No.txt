            My wife and I alternate buying new cars and the summer before last it was my turn. After much research and visits to car lots, I narrowed my choices to a Honda CR-V, the Malibu, and a Mercury Mystique.  I test-drove a toreador red �98 Mystique LS (a demo) and brought it home to give it a close inspection and show it to my wife. She was dazzled by its styling, the power leather seats, stylish alloy wheels, the moon roof, the CD player, and most of all by the power generated by its 2.5 liter six cylinder engine. I wasn�t as impressed by the vehicle, and since I was having a hard time deciding on a car, we agreed that my wife would get this car and I would buy the next new car.

<b>What features do we like?</b>  Foremost, I think, is the powerful acceleration and precise handling characteristics Passing and merging on the beltway is almost effortless. Right turn on red? No problem. This is my wife�s car, but when I know I�ll be driving in heavy traffic, this is the car I drive.  

<b>Other plusses?</b>

The trunk � It�s roomy for a car of this size and easily accessible. The rear seats fold down to accommodate items too long for a trunk that can be conveniently opened with a remote latch by the driver.

The seats � Leather and comfortable. The driver�s seat can be adjusted every which way electronically. The passenger front seat is adjusted manually.
I personally don�t care for leather seats, which is one reason I passed on this car.

Style and appearance � My wife and I both like the styling of this car. I especially like the front grill, the spoiler, and the alloy wheels , and  prefer the Mystique�s styling over that of its Contour cousin made my Ford. 

Interior - The dashboard and controls are arranged stylishly and  for the most part ergonomically. Some features are a remote deck lid release, integrated cup holders, visor mirrors and lights, rear seat heat ducts, handy storage compartments, and a comfortable, four-spoke steering wheel. I could list even more features, but you get the picture.

<b>What don�t I like?</b>   I�m not impressed with the mileage, barely averaging 20 miles a gallon. The car has been returned to the dealer six times in the past year for recalls and warranty repairs in addition to visits for routine maintenance. 
As mentioned before, I don�t care for the feel of leather seats.  The remote trunk release doesn�t work that well because of the heavy spoiler mounted on the trunk lid. This car is not as easy to park as our other cars (�87 Acura and �88 Beretta). It�s hard to squeeze into a tight spot (turning radius?)and I have to remember to make a wider turn when pulling into a parking space.  I don�t like backing up in this car because of vision obstructed by the high headrests and several blind spots. My wife once backed into a basketball post.  She insists it was the car�s fault, not hers.

If I had the option, <b>would I buy this car again?</b> No, I wouldn�t. But then again, I didn�t buy it in the first place. It�s my wife�s car now, and she still loves it. I�m still enjoying my �87 Integra and biding my time with my sights set on a PT Cruiser.
