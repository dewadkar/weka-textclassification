                   Consumer reports rate the mazda protege as the number one buy for small sedans. As an owner of a protege, I must say I agree. Even though the car only has a four cylinder engine, it still has excellent pickup. It handles wonderfully on the highway. The steering is not to tight nor is too loose. Inside the car is as comfortable a ride as any luxury vehicle on the market. The protege gets anywhere from twenty-six to thirty-three miles to the gallon. The car only needs eighty-seven octane fuel which is beneficial considering the outragous prices for gas. The best way tp find out how great the protege really is, is to drive one yourself. But I can guarantee it is worth it. <br><br>
