            Maybe I'll just get this over with quickly and say I will never buy a Chevy again. If you want details, read on.

I bought my first car off my father when I was in high school for dirt cheap. It had roughly 90,000 miles when I got it, and was a death trap from the onset. Constant repairs, including a new alternator (again), a new gas tank and fuel line, coolant leak, and the heater quit working. I took it to two different mechanics, and neither could figure out how to fix the heater. Oh, did I mention the head gasket decided to start leaking for some reason?

In the fall of 1998, I'm suspecting due to the influence of some demonic force, I bought another Corsica. This time, a 1995, which only had 20,000 miles on it. It as a three year lease return owned by a 65 year old barber that only drove it to and from work. It was a good price, and I was in college, so I figured it would at least last me a while. I've regretted it ever since. It now has only 75,000 miles and here is the repair list, at least what I can remember off the top of my head. Some are normal wear and tear, others are not. Keep in mind I kept up with the standard maintenance, i.e. oil changes & filters, transmission flush, coolant flush, air filters, PCV valve replacements, etc.

-brake pads
-rotors
-alternator (at 40,000 miles)
-AC broke
-Heater has gone out
-THREE serpentine belts; in my opinion an engine design flaw, as they were all put on by separate mechanics.
-Radio adjusts volume by itself. A little weird.
-Shocks
-Struts
-Coolant leak
-Oil line leak
-Fuel Line freeze up (despite ice guard protection)
-Windshield wiper fluid line freeze up.
-Lights on radio console work when ever they feel like it.
-Passenger side weather seal came undone
-Driver side door leaks, despite the weather seal is still intact.
-Turn signal has to be turned off manually
-Gear shift sticks, light says it's in neutral despite the fact you can still accelerate.

Again, this is an abbreviated list. The only good thing about the car is the front seats are comfortable, the steering tight, and it only left me stranded once. Wait a minute, is a car supposed to leave you stranded when it only has 40,000 miles on it? At first I thought this is what cars do. But, many of my friends who had foreign cars (mostly Toyota, Honda, or Nissan), didn't have nearly as many problems. And their cars were older and had more miles on them! Another friend of mine however, did own a '95 Corsica, and had even more problems than I did. It became a ritual as we would swap "My Corsica Sucks" stories.

The bottom line, don't ever buy this car, no matter how good of shape it 'appears' to be in.
