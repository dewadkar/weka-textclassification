            I bought my '96 Cirrus LXi for Christmas in '95.  The first time I saw a picture of a Cirrus I knew I had to have one--an excellent looking vehicle.  The interior is very room and the &quot;cab forward&quot; design makes the front seat area seem very airy--when I'm in other cars that have &quot;normal&quot; windshields I feel cramped and claustrophobic.  The view out the front is almost panoramic as the dash is very low, though it's a little hard to see out the rear when backing up.  I've only had a few minor problems and wouldn't hesitate buying another Cirrus.  I usually average around 25-26 mpg with long trips getting me 30-31 mpg--I have the 2.5 V6.  (The V6 is adequate but more power would be nice.)  I also like the way the car &quot;feels&quot; while driving it--the handling is outstanding, the seats are comfortable and the controls are right where they should be.  The thing that does bother me is there is a little too much road noise but I believe the newer models are possibly quieter--but with the excellent stereo, I just turn it up some to cover the noise.  There is plenty of trunk space and lots of room for four adults.  At the price the Cirrus sells for I think a lot of families should take a look...<br><br>
