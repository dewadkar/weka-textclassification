            I purchased my 1999 Durango from Sterling Heights Dodge on October 30, 1999, maintained it, and had no difficulties with it before December 2000. 

On December 15, 2000 with only 53897 miles on the odometer, the oil pressure dropped to zero although the oil was full and clean. I took it to Northwestern Dodge in Ferndale, MI, where it was first determined that a rod had been thrown and later determined that instead a bearing had turned, requiring replacement of the ENTIRE engine. Although it was noted on the repair receipt that the failure was �due to engine sludge�, this was not discussed with me at any point and only appeared on the invoice after I spoke with the Service Department Manager requesting assistance with seeking coverage for the expense with Chrysler. It may be useful to note that the outdoor temperature was unseasonably cold at approximately 25 degrees below zero (which I suspect actually contributed to the failure).

I have been driving Chrysler products for nearly 15 years. This is the first major failure that has not been associated with a recall of some sort. In prior experiences, although inconvenienced by the temporary loss of my vehicle, I have been quite pleased by the actions taken by Chrysler and its representatives.

In this case, however, I was quite disappointed. Not only did I have a major part failure, the repair took over 3 weeks, required me to put up $2850 in advance before the parts would be ordered, cost me nearly $5500 in the end, and the failure was somehow alluded to have been my fault. 

Clearly, I am displeased by the dealership�s service and question why it is listed as a Five Star Dealer. I am also furious that Daimler Chrysler would only stand behind this $35,000 vehicle with a check for $1500 -- less than 1/3 of the cost to repair it.

And now the transmission is slipping....
