            After I first purchased the Safari, I felt the same way everyone else did � I <i>loved</i> it.  It was my big, green baby.  With my second child still just a few months old, the Safari�s plentiful interior space was a breath of fresh air compared to the cramped confines of the four-door we traded in.  I was enamored with the roominess, the style, the cup holders all over the place, the grocery-bag-friendly cargo space behind the rear bench, the six little overhead lights that provide on-demand cabin illumination for rear passengers, the overhead console storage areas, trip computer, etc.  The second bench was perfect for when the in-laws were visiting and we all wanted to go somewhere together, but didn�t want to drive separate vehicles.  And the thing had power, baby!  (Well, compared to the 2.0L four cylinder that I was driving before, that is.)  Dang, didn�t I feel manly towing around a heavy utility trailer or hauling the U-Haul from Pennsylvania to Florida.  I was so pleased with my big, bad Safari that I didn�t have any trouble overlooking its few shortcomings, such as the lack of front, passenger foot room, and the insatiable appetite for unleaded.  Yep, for the first couple of years of our relationship, the Safari treated me real good.  I would have whole heartedly recommended the robust, lovable GMC Safari to anyone that cared to ask.

But then, a funny thing happened:  the warranty ran out.  You see, I�m the kind of person that puts a lot of miles on my vehicles.  My daily commute is somewhere around seventeen miles, one way.  While living in Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale, the family and I made frequent trips to the keys (five hours from Orlando, and two from Ft. Laud.)  We also made the big drive to Pennsylvania three or four times, at around 2000 miles a pop.  Long story short, the ol� Safari hit the 30,000 mile mark in less than two years.  Not too long after the warranty expired, a couple of components just inexplicably pooped out.  The electric door lock actuators on <i>both</i> the driver and passenger sides started to fail at nearly the exact same time.  Then, about a month or two later, the electric motor on the passenger side window began to degrade until, eventually, it stopped working altogether.  Just recently, the driver�s side window motor has shown signs that it might also be going down hill.  Upon query, one of the mechanics at my local GMC dealer explained to me that the Safari has long been plagued with this problem as a result of the way the wires are run from the door to the cabin.  Apparently, when the doors are opened and closed, the wires for the door actuators and window motors have a tendency to rub against some sharp pieces of body metal, causing the insulation to eventually wear off.  This, in turn, causes the motors to short out and, after a period of time, fail.  Oh, how nice!  The lock actuators and window motor have failed because of bad design.  Would GMC consider paying for the repairs even though I wasn�t under warranty anymore?  H*ll no!  There�s a couple hundred dollars worth of maintenance that I hadn�t factored into the �Total Cost of Ownership� formula.

Aside from the bad design described above, I have also found evidence of poor craftsmanship in a few other places.  For example, I have seen screws spontaneously dislodge from their moorings in several locations on the plastic interior paneling.

The real kicker, however, just hit me within the last month or two.  With the weather getting colder lately, I have started noticing a tendency for the Safari to misfire on a couple of cylinders, but only in the morning, and only when it�s really cold out.  At first, the misfiring would only happen on one or two cylinders, and would only last for ten or fifteen seconds.  Or was that twenty seconds?  Or maybe thirty?  As the days drew on, it seemed like it would take longer and longer for the engine to warm up and the misfire to go away.  Then, last week, I noticed that the van was missing on perhaps as many as three or four cylinders.  Then, this week, the misfire didn�t go away until I was half way to work.  Then the �service engine soon� light started to make regular appearances and, at times, blinked rather impatiently.  I assume some sensor on the exhaust system was picking up a whole bunch of unburned fuel resulting from the misfire.  I took my Safari into the shop a couple of days ago, and just got the diagnosis today.  It turns out that the �Central Port Injection� unit has begun to fail.  The �CPI� is a rather large, expensive apparatus that sits atop of the engine and mixes fuel with intake air before it�s sucked into the cylinders.  The mechanic tells me that replacing only the individual failed injectors is impossible; the whole unit must be replaced.  With diagnostic fees, new spark plugs, gasket set, labor, and the cost of the �CPI�, the whole thing is going to cost me over $1,000.00.  �Is there anything�, I asked exasperatedly, �that might have precipitated the failure of the rather expensive CPI?�  The mechanic explained that lots of GMC trucks, but especially ones with the 4.3L six cylinder engine, suffer from rather frequent �CPI� failure.  He told me that he sees this all the time, and has replaced many a Central Port Injection unit over the years.  He chalks it up to bad design.  I called the GMC customer support center to see if the �CPI� is perhaps covered under some kind of extended powertrain warranty.  �No, that�s only covered by the 3 year/ 30,000 mile warranty�, I was told, rather mercilessly, by the GMC operator on the other end.  Well, I guess that�s another grand worth of maintenance that I�ll just have to absorb because of �bad design�.

I�m wondering, now, what critical component will be the next to fail due to �bad design�.  Hopefully, it�s not something that will put me or my family in jeopardy.  At one time, I would have recommended my solid, sturdy, beloved Safari to anyone.  After this, however, it�ll be a good, long time before I�ll consider buying another GMC myself.
