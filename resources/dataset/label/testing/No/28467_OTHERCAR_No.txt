                First the bad news, then the good news.  What we dislike most about the car are it's size and ergonomics.  It even feels small compared to the Ford Escort we used to have (not to mention the more comparably priced Accord and Lumina).  The interior is incredibly uncomfortable.  The front (driver's and passenger's) window controls are almost impossible to use unless your elbows bend backwards.  The front seats recline with a dial instead of a lever (probably to allow finer control) and that makes taking a nap in the car impossible.  You would have to spend several minutes (in a rather uncomfortable position) turning the dial before the seat would fully recline.  Also, the armrest obstructs the parking brake, which gets really annoying really fast if you are the kind of driver that likes to set the parking brake on every time you park the car.  Finally, the quality of the materials and workmanship does not seem appropriate for this price (take a look at the Audi A4 for a comparison).
    Now that I have gotten all that off my chest I can admit tha the car does have its strong points.  It is unexpectedly fun to drive. The 1.9L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine is surprisingly agile.  In fact, it is the best 4-cylinder engine I have driven (including the Audi A4).  In terms of handling and responsiveness I even prefer it to our V6 Accord.  The drawback is that it requires high octane gas (but the mileage is decent -- consistently over 20 mpg in the city).  Another nice feature are the flat folding seats.  The rear and the front passenger seats can fold flat to accomadate rather large loads.  It is also supposed to be very safe but, luckily, we hadn't had a chance to test any safety features yet.

Reliability:
    We have had the car for about 10 months and we already had several problems with it.  First, the driver's side window emits a really loud high-pitched sqeeking noise at highway speeds in windy weather.  Second, the lock on te wagon door breaks consistently.  At this point neither problem has been fixed by the dealer.

Verdict:
    Not worth the price.  My personal recommendation would be a Japanese sedan or minivan.  If you must get a European car, go for the Audi A4.

P.S.
    The dealership experience was the worst we have ever had.  Very high pressure, lot's of lies.
