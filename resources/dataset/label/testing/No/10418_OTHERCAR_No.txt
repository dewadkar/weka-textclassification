            I bought my Jeep Grand Cherokee because I liked the features and appearance...and price.  I had bought it as a brand new left over in the summer of '98.  I had narrowed my search down to the Toyota ForeRunner, Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer, Ford Expedition.  Dollar for dollar, I found the best deal with the Grand Cherokee.  

Also, I have a '90 Jeep Wrangler and a '91 Jeep Cherokee.  All 3 Jeeps have given me numerous problems that were quite expensive to repair.  I still have all 3 vehicles, by the way.  I would not recommend any of them.  All have given me transmission problems.  All have given me problems with the 4-wheel drive mechanism.  All have given me problems with the brakes.  The Wrangler and the Cherokee have also given me problems with the clutch, the Grand Cherokee is an automatic.  I have been driving clutches all of my driving life, never had problems with any other clutch/transmission.  


I hit a deer at 60 miles/hour and sustained over $3000 worth of damage.  I hit another deer a month later and sustained damages totalling over $2000.  The entire front bumper is made of styrofoam encased by plastic, it shatters quite, quite easily.  I love those commercials where they are made to appear indestructable!  HA!  I have brought the car in for servicing to try to do something about the 4-wheel mechanism.  It has 20,000 miles on the odometer, has been to the dealer 4 times already and needs to go back in when there is snow on the ground.  I have gotten stuck in as little as 2 inches of snow in my driveway.  They tell me that it is due to the 'new' 4 wheel drive system, a much improved system over the older one.  So why do I get stuck?  In the summertime, it is a nice car.  In the wintertime, this is another matter.  I will never buy another Jeep again, this is my 3rd attempt, and my last.<br><br>
