            I own the HP C200 Digital Camera and have used it quite frequently when going on vacation.  I find that the camera is not a bad buy but it does have it's faults.  One thing I do not like in this camera is that when you go to take a picture and you press the button to take your photo the camera pauses for about 2-3 seconds and focuses on the subject and then take your photo.  The bad thing about that is if your on vacation for instance and you spot some moose or elk; something you rarely see and you go to take a picture with this camera, you may miss your picture because if something is moving fast it'll be gone when you snap the shot.  Another thing I don't like in this camera is the fact that when you zoom in on something you don't get as good detail as if you were taking a normal 1x zoom.  This camera does come with an 8 MB memory card and has 2X zoom, 1 Megapixel with red eye reduction, a timer (which is good for the photographer if he wants to take a shot of himself somewhere and you can play a slide show on the reasonably good sized screen on the back of the camera.  This camera is also made to plug into your television if you want to do a slide show as well.  I say if you want to buy it now go ahead and get a newer camera it probably has better quality even if you do pay extra.
