            I got this car as a hand me down car from my cousin when I moved to Hawaii to go college, since he went to college in the mainland.  
The car hasn't been driven much because it stayed mainly in the city and my cousin stayed on the mainland after college so no one drove it for years.
I got a hold of it in July of 99 and it had only 50k of original miles on it.  With a major dent on the right side because my aunt is one of the worst driver, solo crash on a fire hydrant in front of the house, if you can believe that.


Pros

It gets you to point A to B and has a lot of power for a small car.  2.0 Liters for a compact 4 cylinder. I think 167 HP.  The paint seems to be still on there, with small amount of rust coming on.


Cons

I have a lot of it, the car doesn't get real good gas mileage for a small car, maybe the 2.0 L engine?  
The car is getting real old and the interior is getting wet from the rain, and I mean a lot of water getting on the carpet have almost 2 inches of rain side my car, which is really not good in Hilo because it is the rainest city in the U.S.  
The timing belt broke at 55k miles and I had to get a tow truck to get it repaired, and repair shop fixed the problem for $500 and the water pump.  It broke the oil pressure gauge.
The fuel gauge is also broken so I have to refill my tank every 200 miles just to be safe.
The a/c went out, maybe it needs more freon, but its not worth the cost to fix if its broke.

My engine is making a terrible rattling noise now, and I looked at the engine and it looks like the oil holder is loose or rattling very loudly that I'm tired of this car so I will have to pick up another one.




Repairs

I haven't done major repairs on this car, other than it needs a new distributor, and fan belt now.

I have changed the oil, timing belt (55k), water pump, tires and brakes.
