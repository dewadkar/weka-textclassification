            This was the worst thing I have ever decided to buy. I really wanted a digital camera so that I can put my pictures on the computer and email to friends. I shopped around and looked at various digital camera but a lot were out of my price range.  I saw this one on sale at Walmart.  It look durable and had a nifty little screen in back and the ability to view all you pictures on the littel screen in back so I tought Wow this must be a good one and takes good pictures and hey its on sale right now for $150.00  Well it worked fine for a while then... disaster.  Of course my son decided to eat the reciept so I tried to take it back and they would not take it.  Here is what happened to the camera.  The picture are not clear, the flash stopped working, nad the battery door hinges broke off. This was only in two months time. I even emailed vivitar several times but they would not answer any of my emails.   So i was stuck with a heap of junk. I now have a digital camera coming thanks to my husbands job who finances employee with no interest and we only have to pay $25 a month.  Now the new camera is very costly over $500 but as the saying goes you get what you pay for.<br><br>
