            After 3,000 miles front brakes were grinding. Dealer replaced front brake pads and did rotor work. Had to replace front brake pads again after 11,000 more miles at 14,000. Dealer said that this was probably normal wear and tear despite me saying that 90% of the miles were highway. Now after 7,000 more miles at 22,000 I have to replace the front pads again. Again I am told that this could be normal. I called Nissan consumer affairs and they said that brake pads are not covered under warranty and that the dealer will have to find a defect regarding this wear and tear for Nissan to cover work. I don't think the dealer will find anything wrong if they know I will be coming in for brakes every 7,000 and 10,000 miles. I know that replacing pads three times within 22,000 is not normal but I keep getting the run around under the facade &quot;It could be normal wear and tear&quot;. Yeah right. Also, after 13,000 miles the dashboard developed a rattle and squeak that is irritating as hell. I would not buy another Quest or Nisssan vehicle to be honest. Primarily because I am not getting any results regarding this brake problem. <br><br>
