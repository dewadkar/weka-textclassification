            and we have to replace the alternator. Since we bought it the gas gauge in the car never reached full even on a full tank of gas so I never really knew if I really needed gas or if I was about to run out of gas.  We just filled up the tank two days ago after going 125 miles, most of the cars we have owned in the past gave up 300 miles before needing to be filled up.

We bought this car last year after finding out we were expecting #3.  This car is pretty roomy up front but there is not much room in the back if happen to have a tall person driving or riding in the passenger side. I'm pretty short and I can still feel my four year olds feet in my back.  The one roomy place is the trunk.  We have been able to haul lots of things in the trunk.

Overall, if I had to recommend this car to a friend I would not.  With the price of gas and having to fill up every 125 miles, its not worth the cheapness. Not only that if you plan on expanding your family, there's not a whole lot of room for three car seats in the back let alone two car seats and a kid even though there is a third seat belt.  It must be meant for grown kids but even then they would all have to be thin to fit three back there comfortably.
