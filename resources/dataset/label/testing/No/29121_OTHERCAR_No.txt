            What you want a truck for would have a lot to do in deciding whether or not to buy the '99 Tacoma. If you read the facts on it plus the facts I know about my fathers Tacoma it is primarily for show. If you want a truck for handling off road and possibly towing a rather large qauntity look elsewhere. The biggest engine that I know of that they will put in a Tacoma is a 6 cylinder. Its max towing capacity with a 6 is 5,000 lbs. All of the other engines are 4 cylinders with max towing of 3,500. But all that I am say here is that it is not your best choice for off road. Though the later model 4x4 Tacoma seem to have been built better and I have seen them do more stuff. If you want a real nice looking truck, look here cause basically that's all that it is.<br><br>
