            My wife and I purchased this vehicle special order a year ago.  When we went to pick it up the bumper was damaged on our special order vehicle.  This should have been the indication of things to come.  It took the dealer three times to properly replace the bumper.  The vehicle was in the shop 3 weeks of the the first 3 months we owned it.  I had several rattles inside the vehicle that the dealer finally said he could not fix.  I finally gutted my brand new vehicle myself and could not believe what I found.  There were wiring harnesses not secured, nuts and bolts laying in the fender well and pieces of trash all over the place.  This told me right away what kind of quality comes out of the Jeep factory.  After I put everything back together my wife and I took the Jeep to the dealer and promptly traded it in on a mini-van.  If you are interested in purchasing an icon that provides no enjoyment buy this vehicle other wise shop around.<br><br>
