            I recently had the chance to spend a weekend - actually about six hours - driving a 2004 Buick Rendezvous, courtesy of the National Car Rental agency at Newark Airport.  National offers renters the opportunity to "self select" vehicles within a given class - and the Rendezvous was my first choice, given the alternatives of a Pontiac Aztec (too ugly) a Chevy Blazer (too familiar) and a Jeep Liberty (too small.)

The Rendezvous is a tall, well proportioned vehicle, with a relatively massive, bright chrome grill.  Buick describes it as &#147Offering styling and capabilities of an SUV, the ride of a luxury sedan and the seating capacity of a minivan.&#148  They deliver.  The braking and steering are responsive, the suspension system surprisingly firm, and the throttle response adequate for East coast highway and city driving.  The seats and driving position are comfortable, and the cargo space generous.

The problem? (And a major one at that!)  The near-invisibility of vehicle instrumentation under various conditions of ambient and vehicle lighting.  On an overcast day, should one manually turn on the headlights (or the interior lights) the pale-green rear-lit readings on the instruments (speedometer, tachometer, fuel and engine temperature) DISAPPEAR against the pale gray-green face of the instrument panel!  Under the best of daylight driving conditions, the thin, small instrument font is barely legible against the same murky background.

For an idea of how bad it is, check out the dashboard photo (and vehicle specifications) at http://www.buick.com/rendezvous/ 
 
As an experienced driver (and motorcyclist) I depend on vehicle instrumentation to keep me informed.  I don&#146t enjoy &#147flying blind.&#148  But by subordinating function (keeping the driver informed) to form (a contemporary designer color scheme), Buick bids this driver &#147Au Revoir.&#148
