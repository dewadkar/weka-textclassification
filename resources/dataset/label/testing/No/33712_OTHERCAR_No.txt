            Don't get me wrong, this is a nice looking, versitle vehicle and I probably would be lost without it.  I only wish I didn't get rid of my old 1992 Caravan.  The side windows on this one don't open, they did on that one.  The 1998 is awful in the snow!  It hasn't been too much of a problem until this year - all the snow in the North East.  I don't expect to keep it through next winter - I don't want to get stuck again with the kids.  

To date, with 42,000 miles, we have had to replace the transmission and the air conditioning system.  It still doesn't seem right.  The air conditioning makes a hissing noise when ever it goes on and you can feel it cut the power of the engine everytime it cycles.  Only a problem during the summer right? WRONG - the defroster is connected to the AC so it goes on everytime you use the defroster!

Other than that, it is comfortable, has a decent ride for a van (kind of sluggish up hills) and is fairly quiet.
