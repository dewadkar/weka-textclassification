            In November of 1999, my dear husband totaled our 1994 Nissan Sentra. 

After pondering whether or not I would let him live for destroying my &quot;baby&quot;, we were stuck with the task of getting another car.

I had heard all kinds of wonderful things about Saturn cars and the Saturn dealers, so I sent my husband to the nearest dealership to take a look.  Several hours later, he came home with a silver 1997 Saturn SL1.

It was dark outside when I got my first look at this car, but I could see that it was a pretty slick-looking vehicle.  After talking with my husband briefly about the costs, financing, etc., I grabbed the keys and took it for a spin.

The first thing that I noticed about the Saturn was that it did not have power seat belts as my Nissan had.  That disturbed me due to the fact that had it not been for the automatic seatbelts in the Nissan, my husband would not have been wearing one at all, and most likely would not be with us today.  The dealer told my husband that Saturn did away with the power seatbelts because they turned out to be more trouble than they were worth.

The next thing that I noticed was that the steering was very tight.  I dont know if this is a characteristic in the Saturn or that I was driving something that I was not used to, but it bothered me just the same.

The interior of the car felt cramped.  I am a tall woman, standing 5'9&quot; and I need a whole lot of leg room, and the Saturn SL1 was severely lacking in that department.  The seats did not go back far enough for me to drive the car comfortably, and my left knee rubbed against the window handle.  (No power windows.)

The seats were not very comfortable, and it got to the point where I began to feel claustrophobic after just driving the car for a few minutes.

There was not as much room in the Saturn as there had been in our Nissan, and oddly enough, it looked bigger.

On the plus side, the car seemed to have a whole lot of &quot;get-up-and-go&quot;.  That was definitely a plus for my husband, who commuted 30 minutes to work each day, but pretty impractical for me in town.

Although this was a 4-door vehicle, it is more or a sports car than a family car.  We only had the car for a month, as financing fell through at the last minute.  I believe that someone was looking out for us, because I really did not want to keep the Saturn.  Thankfully, we didnt get to.
