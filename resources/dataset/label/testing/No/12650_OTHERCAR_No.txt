            I hate to say it, but along with one of the other reviewers I'd have to agree that this car is a lemon on wheels.   

My husband and I were having problems with another American made vehicle at the time and decided to look around for a nice SUV.  We fell in love with this truck as soon as we both saw it.  It is a one of a kind.  The dealer sent this truck to a place that added special detailing and a customized kit to the exterior.  The inside was all done up as well and all the extras including real wood trim and a cd rack.  We decided we had to have it.  After taking it for a test drive, and haggling over the price on our trade in for at least an hour we were the proud owners of a new  custom detailed 1995 GMC Jimmy.  Oh if we would have known then what he know now.

I have to admit that the truck drives smooth, is beautiful inside and out, and we have had no problems with the body, but that is where it ends.  This truck has been less reliable than the 15 year old Nissan truck I have.  In the time we have had the Jimmy, we have spent as much money in repairs as my used Nissan cost!  Not to mention that the Jimmy has left us sit at least 7 times, and my old faithful Nissan?  NONE!

Here is just a SMALL taste of what has gone wrong with the Jimmy.


* The truck is noisy, even when just jaunting around the city at a slow pace.  It constantly squeaks and groans, and this started about one year after we purchased it.

2) The halogen fog/driving lights both burned out within the first two months of purchase.  (we were told that had they not been under the initial warranty, they would have cost $70 to replace)

3) Within the first month it left us sit FIVE times because the back hatch popped open on it's own and that drained the battery enough that we needed to have someone jump it.

4) We had all kinds of computer and electrical problems within the first year.  Once it just stopped running while on the road. Then one day the battery blew up, and all the wires around the battery had to be replaced.

5) Within two years the brakes needed replaced.  We are NOT that hard on our brakes.  In fact, my Nissan has only had the brakes replaced once since I have had it.  (7 years)  We have had the brakes replaced in the Jimmy twice now in the 5 years we owned it.

6) Not too long after the brakes needed replaced, the anti-lock brake light came on.  They told us that the computer chip needed replaced.  The chip alone costs $1200, and guess what....it's not under warrenty!  Guess who's STILL driving with that little light ON on the dash?  We can drive without it, and that is exactly what we are doing.

7) The alternator went out three years into ownership.


This truck has given us a bad taste in our mouths for GMC trucks.  The dealer calls us every so often and asks if we are ready to trade it in for a newer one.  We just laugh and hang up.  This thing isn't even paid off yet.  We have another 5 payments on it.  What will we do when it's paid off you ask?  Trade it in on a NISSAN of course (o:<br><br>
