                 This car is my dad's, right off the bat.  It's not mine.  But you know what, I don't mind that so much....
  
      On the plus side, it looks very sporty.  It's a convertible, has twin tailpipes (always looks good), and it's fast, I guess.  Well, maybe it would be if it wasn't an automatic.  I mean, it's certainly not slow, but for a V-6, I would think it'd be quicker.  If I'm going to fill it up with gas as often as a V-6 needs to be, I want some real speed!  If it were a standard I think it'd be much better.  It gets OKAY gas mileage, but not great (around 25 highway, maybe 19 city).  It comfortable in the front, and the strereo system is really good.

      Minuses pile up pretty quickly though.  Like I said, it's not very fast.  The back is C-R-A-M-P-E-D.  It has broken down quite a few times and still needs a rear stabalizer.  The suspension is less than stellar, and there are a few odd squeaks and groans from it when you're driving. 

       All in all, this car is really good to take for a spin, but I wouldn't want ot own it.  It takes all the care of a sports care to keep it on theroad, but it doesn't FEEl like one.  Like I said though, it does LOOK sporty.  I'm perfectly happy driving it every once in awhile, but I wouldn't want to own it.<br><br>
