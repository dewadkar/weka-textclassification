            My husband and I was looking for a larger car with more space and a little more power. We went to a dealership to look for it. We saw a 1995 Jeep Cherokee and didn't look at anything else.
   I read in a buying guide that they had a high roll over rate and well that didn't seem to matter. We financed the Jeep, and it drove like a dream. We like having the extra space and air conditioning. Also the power that it has is nice when you need it.
  Although after about four months when we would turn on the air conditioning the car would smell funny for a few minutes and then it would go away. Then a month after that we could start the car only when the steering wheel was in a certain position. Then one day it wouldn't start at all.
  We had to get it towed to the dealership and come to find out that model year had a problem with the harness and with the ignition switch (electrical) but they wouldn't recall that year because it would cost them too much to replace it. So they are just waiting to make money off the Jeep's that have this problem.
  Well anyway they said that they had fixed it, but five months later the same thing happened. This time I was alone with my 12 month old son in the middle of a city I was not familiar with and 60 miles away from home.
  Then some time later had some ice on the roads, and I was only going 30mph to 35mph. People were passing me like I was going 20mph on a 45mph road. Well to say the least the Jeep went right off the road and upside down. I was going so slow that it was fixable. All of these things happened in a years time.
  I can't wait until my Jeep decides to break down on me again. Who knows maybe this is just my experience, but I can't get rid of the car cause we still owe 9700.00 on it.  <br><br>
