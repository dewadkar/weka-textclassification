            I bought this car for my wife in 1994.. 44,000 miles for $5000..
The paperwork that came with the car says the original owner paid $22,000 for this car new in 1988.

Every high end car I have ever owned has failures in the power options along the way. This one is no different but has had less problems then our Lincolns or Caddys. 

In 35,000 miles I have replaced the following

steering rack and ps pump 
altenator
SMEC (engine computer)
oil pressure sensor
radiator
rebuilt one power window motor
one temp sensor for the climate control

Not too bad for a 12 year old car. Paint is still decent

The 3.0 v6 gets 31mpg on the highway even with 80,000 miles on the odometer. The 3 speed automatic transmission is bulletproof. The rear air shocks are great with the trunk loaded for vacation or a run to the mall.

The factory Bosch ABS system has been flawless.

What could go wrong if you get one of these..
The 3.0 v6 mitsubishi engine in the 1988 models is known to have valve stem seal problems once you get up around 100,000 miles. I guess I will find out if Mobil 1 use since I got this car will slow down this problem.<br><br>
