            I was looking for a car.  NOT A NEW ONE.  I didn't want a new car, because you loose so much as soon as you drive them off the lot.  

My husband and I decided to look for me a car.  We wanted something average.  Nothing real expensive or fancy.  We were planning to start a family in the next couple of years.  

Basically, we wanted something cheap, that got good gas mileage (I drove 60 miles a day to and from work), was a 5 speed (that was stupid), and looked nice.

I don't like BIG cars.  We looked all around our local dealers and then drove 60 miles to Columbia, Missouri to look at a Hyundai.  I didn't even know what they were really.  My husband said they were advertising them really cheap on the radio so we thought we would drive up and check them out.  

I test drove a brand new one and really liked the way it handled.  It had get up and go.  It got great gas mileage, was a 5 speed (dumb), and it looked very nice.  

We looked at another one, that was 2 years old, but didn't come with the really good warranty.  It came with a warranty, but not even close to the advertised one.  You have to buy it brand new from the dealer or directly from an individual to get the 10 years or 100,000 power train warranty.  If you buy a used one from the dealer the warranty is void.  That is stupid in my opinion.  

We decided to go with the brand new one because of the warranty and the price.  It did the trick the first year I had it.  Now I have a 4 month old son and it is the biggest pain in the you know what.  The car seat barely fits through the door and behind the seat to get it in the car.  Once you get it in the car you have to fight with it to get it to attach to the base and mean while your banging the seats (and your head) and jerking the baby around.  You also now have no room in the back seat for anyone or anything.

The trunk is nice though.  It holds the stroller and SOME groceries.

The only problem other than the family issue I had with this car was that the rear passenger window blew out one morning.  I had only had the car about a month and it was chilly (not freezing) outside and I heard a loud pop.  I didn't think to much about it until I got in my car and noticed how cold it was.  Then I looked in the back seat and their was glass every where.  The customer service folks were a little difficult at first.  You just have to be a little aggressive with them.

All and all it is a good car, just not a family car.
