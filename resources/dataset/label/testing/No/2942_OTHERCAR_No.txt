            The Acura Integra is a gem of a car.  I personally own a 1998 Integra GSR.
I love my car!  It's fast and responsive, and many of you know that Acura equals quality and dependability.  So maybe you're interested in buying and Integra for yourself.  You need to decide which model is the right one for you.  

The (1994 - 2000 model) Integra comes in 5 models: GS, RS, LS, GS-R and Type R).  The RS and LS models are very similar in features.  If you want an Integra for the looks, quality and if you're on somewhat of a budget, these would be the right models for you.  The GS is a little more upscale.
It comes with power windows and locks and other amenities that make for a convenient driving experience.  You can expect to spend between $16,000 to $18,000 for a GS.  These three models come with the same standard engine: 1.8 litre, DOHC non-vtec.  For the people who like more than a few conveniences and are looking for a sportier ride, I highly recommend the GS-R and Type R models.

The Integra GS-R is buy far one of the most exciting cars I've ever driven.  You get basically all the features of a GS model, however you also get alloy wheels and and engine that roars once you hit about 6000 RPMs.  This is due to the fact that GS-R's engines are equipped with VTEC (variable valve timing) which gives you 30 more horsepower than any of the three previously mentioned models.  This proves to be about 170 horses.  The price: around $21,000.  I highly recommend this car if you are not on such a tight budget, and if money is no object, then last but certainly not least is the Type R.

The Integra Type R is by far a car made for those who like to race.  With an 8500 redline and almost 200 horses under the hood, this car proves to be a true performance machine.  This one turns heads.  Introduced in the Us in 1997, there were very few made, and the demand was not so high, so they were discontinued in 1999.  However, due to popular demand, Acura/Honda decided to bring them back, and they are in high demand.

The Acura Integra is a car very worthy of praise for it's quality, dependability and for it's performance.  Cars like this only come along once in a great while, and I'm sure you will feel the same way if you have or are considering driving one for yourself.  What are you waiting for?<br><br>
