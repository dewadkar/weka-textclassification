             A Mustang is a wonderful all around sports car!!  It has been around since 1964!!  The early years i thin are still the best cars but some of the things on this new 2000 were on the early models. Such as the ring around the symbol of the Mustang.  My friend has a  1997 Mustang Cobra with a mystic paint job!  Can you say wow.  Can this car win some awards! This car goes to almost 11 shows a year and has not gotten below 2nd place.  This paint job is pretty smooth When the sun shines on the car it turns different colors such as green, blac, purple, blue it is relly neat looking!!<br><br>
