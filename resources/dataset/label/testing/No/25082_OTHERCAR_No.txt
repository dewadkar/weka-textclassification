            We know Chevy is notorious for very bad quality, but the deal was too good, and it has a warranty and my wife liked it.  We looked at the imports but my goodness, what they want for them.  We had $2K negative equity on trade, the sticker was over $19K on the cavalier (really.)  We got them to $11K and they tacked back on to bring it back up to what you see on this page (a little over $13K)  The car was manufactured 9/23/03, we bought it 11/08/03 with only 9 miles on it..on 11/09/03 we had to drive it over 280 miles.  We kept it at 55mph or under, but the car creaked liked an old jallopy under the driver's front wheel!  We couldn't hear it on the test drive in the city, but out on the country roads, man..creak, creak, everytime the car adjusted for road conditions, it seemed like the strut or shock, or spring and it creaks, everytime it extends itself.  I'm six foot and it is cramp, my wife 5'4" perfect for her, I don't feel safe in it and neither does she now after the drive. The handling is firm though, the cd okay but cheap, the seats okay, the front cupholders are in the way of the console for AC adjustments.  The second plug-in for cell phone charging is in a bad position (the cord and plug will stick you in your left leg if you are a front passenger).  We bought the base Cavalier with the something package, CD, Tilt, int wipers, rear spoiler, 16"tires, AC, running lights, PwrLocks, keyless entry, passive theft deterrent (who would want to steal it?) remote interior trunk switch..I thought back on the trip and realized that today's Cavalier is yesterday's Comet or Maverick..
