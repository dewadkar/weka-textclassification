            I bought my 1995 Pontiac Grand Prix in 1997, with 47,000 on the odometer.  I must admit, I was 100% sold only by the cars appearance.  That's one sharp looking car!!!    It was white with a grey interior, had the rear spoiler, the alloy wheels, it was beautiful.

Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing I can say.

From the get-go I had problems.  At first, they were minor.  The armrest broke off with no provocation from me.  The insulation under the steering column that holds all of the wiring in fell down at my feet and had to be taken out.  The paint on the window controls and the radio controls that are on the steering wheel completely stripped off.

I went to use the cigarette lighter, and it pushed itself right into the steering column.  We were never able to fix that, so there was just a gaping hole.  

I replaced the power antenna twice, and even the third one didn't work right, but by then I had given up.

The tail lights had water leaks.  

The passenger side window could not be rolled up by the passenger.  The passenger could roll the window down all they want, however.   Seems like a minor annoyance, but trust me, if you commute to work with someone else for an hour every day, and they forget they cannot roll the window up, it gets completely aggravating to keep re-adjusting the window.  So much so that I almost put tape over the window control to prevent anyone from trying to use it.  

The trunk would not open with the key.  It had to be popped open through the glove compartment.  OK, I could deal with that.  Except that the button in the glove compartment did not always work.  A fact I discovered when my trunk was full of groceries.

The driver side door almost totally fell off the hinges.   I got that fixed, but then the door wouldn't stay open completely.  Another thing that seems like a minor annoyance, but when you're trying to grab a bag of groceries from the passenger seat (because I no longer put groceries in the trunk, for obvious reasons) and the door slams on your shin, it can get a bit bothersome.

The keyless entry stopped working about a year after I got the car.

The air conditioning ceased working this summer.  I tried to have it fixed, but nobody could determine what the problem was, needless to say, it was a warm summer for me.

I got my first state inspection rejection sticker this past February.  According to the inspector, my front end "was about to fall off".  I had it looked at, and was told a few different things.  I didn't bother fixing it because nobody could tell me exactly what the problem was, only that the front end was "loose" and I could lose control of the car and crash at any time.

The brakes had to be replaced (rotors and all) more times than I care to admit.  

My transmission died at 70,000 miles.  I took it to a Pontiac expert, and also a regular all around transmission expert.

The Pontiac "expert" couldn't find the problem at all, period.  The other transmission person took my transmission out, rebuilt it and put it back in.  It worked for a day, and then it died.  I took it back.   He took my transmission out, and put a different rebuilt in.  That didn't work at all.  Then he took a Bonneville transmission and put that in.  That worked, but it was *awful*!!  He eventually took my original transmission and put that back in, and for some reason it worked.  It didn't work good, but it worked.  By that point, I had been borrowing or renting cars for 2 months.  My car was never the same after that.  It became a gas guzzler, it would always try to put itself in 4th gear, it was terrible.

My shocks/struts also just went *kaput* with no notice that it was coming.  I went over a speed bump one day, and *blammo* from that day on, the rear end of the car kept slamming on the rear tires.  I could not have anyone in the backseat, and even just having myself and a passenger in the front, it was a scary ride.  It was also a really good time to try and take a turn and apply the brake at the same time without shocks - you never knew where you'd end up.  You might make your turn, you might get shifted elsewhere.  

I have missed work more times than I care to remember because my car either wouldn't start, or would start but wouldn't go anywhere, or would go somewhere and *then* conk out.

In the last 6 months, I have replaced the alternator twice, and the battery once.   This past Monday morning, my boyfriend went out to warm up my car (it was 60 degrees here on Monday morning, yet my car had to be warmed up or it would stall), and it was completely dead.  The battery and/or alternator again.  

By that point, I'd had it, and was ready to send The Great White Hope to the Junkyard in the Sky.   I called AAA to come and jump start my car.  While I was waiting for them to come, I placed a call to a dealership where a friend of mine works, and gave him all of my information to get me pre-approved for a car loan within the hour.  The AAA mechanic showed up and to my surprise and delight, it started!!! 

I managed to get it to the dealership, and directly off of my hands forever.  I am now the proud owner of a 1997 Honda Accord, and I will NEVER, EVER buy Pontiac again.  

For those of you looking to buy one of these cars....May God be with you!!!
