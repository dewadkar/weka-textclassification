            Good:
good power, comfortable ride, had a good warranty

Bad:
by the time my 91 reached 7 years old, the entire A/C (a piece at a time), the alternater twice, the power steering 5 times, the thermostat yearly, etc... were all replaced.. not to mention the abnormal tire wear due to axle's being out of balance (could never prove it, but I cannot imagine that I bought that many tires that were &quot;out of round&quot;).

It finally was destroyed in an accident when the cruise control failed to disengage when I hit the brake... fortunately nobody was hurt, and it did not roll when I made a SEVERE lane change, but I still ended up on the concrete median wall.

I'll miss it, I did love driving it, unfortunately I drove it too much to the shop.
