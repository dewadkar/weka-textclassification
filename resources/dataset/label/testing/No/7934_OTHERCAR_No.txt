            Charlie, my better half, had desperately wanted a Jeep Wrangler ever since he started driving five years ago. When he told me that he was finally going to get one, I feigned happiness for him - then when his back was turned, I grimaced. Over the next few days I subtly tried to talk him out of it (<i>Hey, look at these nice Cherokees! Oooo, wow, what a great-looking Ford Explorer!</i>) but to no avail. His heart was set on a V6, 5-speed, '97 Jeep Wrangler with at least 30&quot; tires.

I can't really explain why I don't care for Wranglers. Well, actually, yeah, maybe I can. But it's difficult because in actuality, I think they're great-looking, sporty vehicles. Overall, their reliability is pretty good (after a certain year, anyway- I think about '97). But to sum up all of the Jeep's major flaws - it's just about the most impractical thing anyone can drive.

I'm not saying you care. Practicality just isn't a consideration sometimes. Would you turn down a Lamborghini Diablo just because it's a two-seater that gets a whopping 9 miles to the gallon? Or, for a more realistic comparison: lots of people own a Ford Excursion. It gets something like 12 miles/gallon and it's the size of a yacht (valet parking, anyone?). But people buy them, regardless, because... well, I guess they're fun to own. It's the same thing with a Jeep Wrangler.

That said, I'm getting down to business. 

As you can imagine, putting on and taking off <b>the top</b> of the Jeep is a really yucky task. The hard top is almost impossible to work with. Charlie has the lesser of two evils- a soft top. Trouble is, he can't figure out whether he wants doors or not, windows or not... the possibilities are endless, because the top and doors come off in about 7 different pieces. But stop and think if you really want windows that you &quot;roll down&quot; using a zipper. Which brings me to...

...<b>leaks</b>. Lots of them. I doubt that the hard tops have a problem with this (being that they're more secured), but the soft tops certainly do. 

The roof is... <b>noisy</b> (have you ever watched a home video shot outside in high winds? Yeah. Kind of like that). Again, I don't think hard tops have this problem. Listening to the radio while driving could prove to be a stressful task unless you have a soundbar, which is a set of speakers installed right above the the front seat, next to the rollbar. 

Not a good idea to have any kind of expensive sound system or cd case inside the Jeep. Well, not unless you want to be a victim of <b>theft</b>. In that case, go right ahead.

I've both driven the Jeep and ridden in it, and I can give you mixed feelings on those. On one hand, the highway ride in it is surprisingly comfortable and smooth. On the other hand, the soft suspension makes any small bump in the road feel like you just hit a woolly mammoth. The vehicle is geared very high - you can drive about 60 mph in fourth, on flat land, and not feel like you should even upshift yet. There's nothing good to be said about the seats or the awkward-feeling, straight-up-and-down dash setup on the passenger's side. It just stinks.

I should also mention that my boyfriend's 6-cylinder, 5-speed tends to get around 15 miles to the gallon. Happy pumping!

I have to admit that despite it's comfort and practicality shortcomings, the Wrangler is, very oddly, fun to drive. But to be stuck a passenger, like me, is hell on earth, and I find myself saying a lot...

<i>Sweetie, why don't we take my car tonight?</i>
