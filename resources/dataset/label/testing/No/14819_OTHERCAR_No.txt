            The Trans Am has always had great power and will hopefully continue through out time.The biggest problem with the Trans Ams handling is the weight.The car is heavy compared to the Chevy Camaro Z28.With the Trans Am though the top end is still unknown on the track,the computer on the Camaro limits it's power,but with it's weight you do not notice it.Although both cars come with a wide range of engines,per say the famed LT1,LT2,LS1,LS2,and the now famous LS4,which is in the 2000 Firehawk Special package,all of the engines can be upgraded on Horsepower with no internal work and little or no efford under the hood.The weight on the other hand is a problem to solve,and can get costly.The looks of the Trans Am and the sleekness are perfect.The drivetrain leaves no dought in anyones mind that the base power is always there when needed.The six speed transmission delivers the gear ratio needed for fun and race,the automatic transmission does have it's good points by not having to shift in heavy traffic,but takes away from the power delivery to the rear wheels.The interoir is great for that comfort and race feeling all in one.Back to the weight problem,the biggest problem is on a road race track the heavyness of the car will push out the frontend and cause it to slid on hard corners,which makes it hard to take a corner at high speed.I have found a cheap way to help with this problem,it's not a cure,but it does help,the tires that come on the Trans Am are made by GoodYear and are called Eagle GC's,don't get me wrong about GoodYear,they are great tires,but they don't help the handling of this car.The tires that I found to give alittle better grip on the track are Potenza tires,which I have purchased at Firestone,the Potenza tires are from Bridgestone,suprised I bet.There is one other problem that I have noticed with all six speeds,and that is the skipshift feature,it is not there.The program on the computer will not let you skipshift,unless you have the program changed at the dealer.I <br><br>
