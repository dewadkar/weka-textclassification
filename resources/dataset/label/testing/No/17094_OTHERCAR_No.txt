            Gone are those halcyon days of yore when the state of the art in sport utility vehicles was a aged Bronco riding high on custom shocks and huge gnarly knobbies, with the requisite gun rack and red neck (or two) visible through the rear window, and a decidedly right-wing array of sentiments displayed across the rear bumper (Gun rights? Automotive loyalties? What fishing means to mankind? It was all there, for public review and edification.)

First it was the domestic gentrification of the genre, as we viewed an inceasingly sorry procession of examples of what Detroit thought a sport utility should be: increasingly posh, with interior appointments no self-respecting off-roader would be caught dead with.  But this was not enough.  Oh, no.  Now we get to Share The Dream with foreigners whose vision of the off-road experience is even more surreal.  Exhibit A: the Mercedes-Benz M-Class (Munchkin-Mobile? Metal-Flake Muffin? Hmmm...), a vehicle so pricey that unless you are in the habit of stoking the rec room fireplace with freshly printed $50's, you wouldn't take it off-pavement on a New York bet.  Calling this a &quot;sport&quot; vehicle is like calling pro basketball a mental exercise. The only sport you're likely to see with this vehicle is the pierced teenaged hitchhiker carrying a sign which says &quot;Will discuss Nietsche for mileage.&quot;

Who Should Buy This Vehicle: Yuppies with low self-esteem.

Who Shouldn't Buy This Vehicle:  Anyone who will actually drive on a gravel road or worse.
