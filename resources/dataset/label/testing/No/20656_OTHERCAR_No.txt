            I have an A6 Quattro.  It is a wonderful car when you really look at the overall picture.  The interior is unmatched in its luxurious design.  The exterior styling is a true eye catcher.  However, I have decided to sell this vehicle next month.  I will detail the reasons.

The car has spent more time in the shop than in my driveway. It started to leak coolant almost a year ago.  The dealer would keep it for a week at a time and then tell me nothing was wrong with it. On one visit the service manager assured me that it was fine.  I started it up in the dealer's parking lot to drive home. The warning light went on so I popped the hood.  The coolant bottle was bone dry!  The service manager told me that there really wasn't anything wrong with the car and gave me a bottle of coolant!

About 4 months ago I had all the seals and gaskets replaced after it started leaking oil. 1500 miles later around 11pm in the middle of the country the sprocket broke and destroyed the timing belt, in turn damaging the engine to the tune of $3100.  I had it towed to the closest dealer who determined that the previous dealer who did the work improperly repaired the engine.  The previous dealer refused my request to pay for repairs because they "did not know the motivation of the diagnosing dealership".  I had two other independent techs look at it and they also agreed that the sprocket was removed improperly resulting in a fracture. The dealership that performed the work also told me that they had better technicians and there was no way they could have been responsible.  I contacted the BBB and Audi of America. Finally, after 3 weeks, they have agreed to repair the vehicle.  However, the service manager told me that he was "disappointed in me" since I had contacted Audi of America and the BBB.  He told me that he considered not fixing it since I contacted those institutions!  I asked for the tear down costs and he refused stating that he had done enough already!  He also stated that if I intended to sue for the $500 in tear down costs he would not fix anything.  

I have many other stories of 3 hour oil changes and sarcastic service managers.  There was the time that the vehicle broke down under their warranty.  I live an hour away.  They told me that if I drove my "loaner" more than 100 miles in one day they would charge me .25 per mile!  

I strongly, strongly encourage anyone thinking of purchasing an Audi to look at all other options first.  They are great cars. They appear to have a great warranty.  However, there are horror stories even under warranty.  They appear not to care about repeat customers at all. Audi of America asked me to stop calling them for assistance since it was "not their problem".  

If you purchase an Audi pray that you don't have any difficult problems with the car. If you do you may have to deal with their customer no service people. Also keep in mind that on average you have to make appointments for any type of service. These appointments have be made in many cases as many as 3 weeks in advance. I just honestly wish I had known any of this before the purchase. I could have saved myself a lot of wasted time with subpar people.
