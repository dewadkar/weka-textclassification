            <b>The preceding review (the part in italics) was written after owning the Dodge Ram for only a few months.  Since then, I have had continual problems with the oil system on this vehicle.  In less than 10k miles I have had 3 oil pumps replaced and the manifold gasket replaced twice.  Finally, after taking the truck in for the oil pressure dropping to 8 psi 3 times (and $1,000 worth of repairs later) in 3 months the dealer advised that the problem was due to poor maintenance on the truck and the oil sludging up from the lack of oil changes.  I knew that poor maintenance was not the problem because with all the problems I started having my oil changes averaged once every 500 miles.  After the last trip to the dealer for service they finally said that the problem will only be remedied if I completely replace the engine, and of course, they will not warranty this because of their aforementioned explanation.  (Estimated repair of $6,00-$7,000)

I decided to do a little research on the internet and found that thousands of other  97-2000 Ram V8 Magnums have reported the same problem.  After consulting with a couple of mechanics and some extensive research I have found that there is a compression flaw in the V8 Magnum engines that Chrysler refuses to warranty or take responsibility for.  

According to 4 different sources (not counting mechanic consulting), I have found that Chrysler has the compression set far to high on  this particular engine.  This high compression causes the oil to jell up into a sludge that reduces the engine oil pressure down from the minimum 17 psi to virtually nothing, eventually causing the engine to &#145blow up&#146.   There also is a common problem with the 4-6th cylinders actually seizing up.  According to all consumer complaints I have read on the internet, Chrysler did not warranty any of these engines and all the customers were advised that it was due to the lack of proper maintenance.  

Currently I have found two class action lawsuits pending against Chrysler regarding this problem and literally over 500 complaints on the same problem reported through the auto safety hotline.  (Link to class action registration available upon request.)

I quickly traded this vehicle in however, for many, this would end up in an expensive repair if not taken care of immediately.  I would recommend avoiding any 97-2000 Dodge V8 Magnum engines included on the Ram, Dakota, or Durango. </b>

<i>Review written with only 3 months of use on this vehicle. 

Who would of thought that I would ever purchase a truck, let alone the "Mother of all trucks."  All of my driving life, I have always grown up on small sports cars, and until lately never dreamed of actually purchasing a truck.   When shopping for a new vehicle recently, we knew that we needed more room than our small cars would provide.  We were considering the Nissan 4-Runner, Toyota Land Cruser, Jeep Cherokee, and Dodge Durango, yet all of the SUVs we were looking at had one major problem, lack of cargo space.  Our sales person asked us if we ever considered a truck over a SUV, we humored him and decided to take the <b>Dodge Ram 2500 Quad Cab</b>.   We were absolutely amazed that the cab had the luxury we normally associated with the finer SUVs, and the styling of the Ram was unique enough to make us feel as though we were not driving an old "pick-up". The model we decided to purchase was the 2500 Quad Cab Laramie.

<b>Power</b> The <b>Dodge Ram 2500</b> is not lacking in any power with the Magnum V8 engine.  The 5.9 liter engine has an impressive 245hp at 335lbs of torque, and I was luckily to have the truck upgraded with a new air intake, headers, and free flowing exhaust.  I was worried that moving into a truck from a sports car, would mean loosing the high power I was so spoiled to, however, I am not disappointed in the least.  Driving the truck, you at first, do not feel the power in your acceleration, and compared to the 5 second 0-60 time on my last car, off the line this truck seems to be sluggish.  From a rolling acceleration you can really tell the power of the truck.  When merging onto a interstate, there is no hesitancy to catch up to, and overtake the traffic.  Where you really notice the power in the Ram, is just listening to the engine.  The V8 Magnum, along with the headers, create a low roar that leaves no question of the power under the hood of this truck.  With this power comes poor gas mileage.    I have estimated that in the city I average between 12-15 mpg, and on the highway I can get up to 20mpg, both by today's standards, are very low numbers.  With the poor gas mileage, and extra large fuel tank, I am finding that I spend upwards of $40.00 each week on gas.  

<b>Styling</b>  Very few can argue that this is one beautiful truck.  The Dodge styling is highly unique, and reflects the new German blood that Chrysler has.  The Ram has the option of color matched grill and bumpers or chrome. I opted for the chrome as it highlighted the almost Ferrari Red exterior.  I recommend that anyone who purchases a truck, with any intention of carrying anything in it, purchase a bed liner.  The first couple of items I put in my bet scratched the paint, and could have easily destroyed the flawless look of my truck.  At that point, I decided that a bed liner would be a necessity, and was a great improvement to the overall appearance of the vehicle.  

<b>Comfort</b>  As I stated earlier, I was quite impressed with the interior of the <b>Dodge Ram 2500 </b> is far more luxurious than one would expect in a truck. Even though I did not choose the leather option, the cloth seats are still very comfortable and stylish.   The drivers seat has a very effective lumbar support, and both the driver and the passenger have six way power seats.  The folding middle seat offers a wonderful storage space that is roomy enough to hold a laptop computer if necessary.  There are four drink holders, two in the front, above the radio, and two for the rear seat passengers below the front seats.  Dodge was wonderful enough to include two additional power outlets for running radar detectors, cd players, or even phone chargers.  The six speaker Infinity sound system is exceptional in its sound quality, and even though I did not opt for the six cd changer, there is actually an increase in sound quality just running a portable cd player through the tape deck.  

Driving the Ram, you definitely can tell you are in a truck.  While this is a comfortable vehicle to drive, the steering is much stiffer than your average sports car. Getting used to parking was a difficult challenge due to the large size of the vehicle, do not expect to fit into the small left over spaces in this truck.  I have just made it a habit to park further away in the lot, as to avoid tight spaces.  The suspension of the truck is quite exceptional.  Even driving over speed bumps, the truck is stiff enough to keep my cd player from skipping.  

Over all, I am very happy with the <b>Dodge Ram 2500 Quad Cab</b>.  I have only had one small maintenance problem in the two months I have had this truck, and we determined it was only due to purchasing some bad gas.  If there are any updates to my experience with this truck, I will be sure to update this review.  As for now, I am glad I went out on a limb and purchased this truck, and so far I would recommend this to anyone in need of some more cargo space.  As for price, the Ram compares to most low cost SUVs, starting about $25,000 for a almost fully loaded model.

 Please base your purchasing decision on the first part of this review as it will relate to your long term reliability of this truck.
