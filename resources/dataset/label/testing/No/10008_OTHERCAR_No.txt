            My girlfriend and I bought our 2000 Kia Sephia a few months ago.  I have to be honest and say that this experience has been everything but pleasant.  The local dealership (on Greystone Blvd.) here in South Carolina where we live originally got our business because we were looking to buy a Kia Rio primarily and they were the only dealership in town who even had any. We have taken our car in to be serviced twice already in two or three months.  Each time I brought a detailed, typed list of complaints (two copies...one for me and one for them) and went outside with the customer service manager to show and discuss personally with her what we were unsatisfied with.  The second time we even took her for a test drive so she could hear all of the rattles and noises that were part of our complaints.  She said she heard all of them and understood before we left how we could be upset and unsatisfied with what we consider a long term investment. She assured us that everything would be straightened out in a timely manner and that she would personally give our car a Quality Check before we came to pick the car up.  Each time we got the car back-only half of our complaints had been fixed.  The other problems we were told are standard of the 2000  Kia Sephia model.  I am very upset that some of the things about the car were not brought to my attention when we purchased the car because if they would have been...I never would have bought this car.  On the floor where the seat belt bolts into the side panel of the car (behind the seat) there are large holes on each side around the bolt.  The dealership tells us that the carpet is pre-cut so it must be larger in order to make sure if fits around the bolt.  They do not sell any accessory piece to cover the holes either.  I asked.  I just feel like they are giving us the run around.  There are several other complaints we have...unfortunately I don't have enough room for all of those.  To any one considering buying a 2000 Kia Sephia...it's  good car for a college student.  However, carefully evaluate the car before you purchase it and see what I am talking about with the holes and do not be upset if the Kia dealership sales associates or management do not give you the 5 STAR customer service treatment like they pride themselves on.<br><br>
