            The Mavica Family

Digital photo technology is here to stay and innovations and advancements in image quality and convenience are occurring in the marketplace at an extreme pace.  Sony has finally brought it�s Mavica line of digital cameras into the forefront with the CD1000.  The Mavica has always been bulky which was an inevitability due to its housing of removable storage media in the form of a 3.5 inch floppy and now a 3 inch CD-R.  With the size of digital images I could never quite accept the trade-off between camera size and the limited storage capacity of a floppy disk as being anything other than a gimmick targeted at the novice digital camera consumer.  This coupled with the lack of an optical viewfinder on previous Mavica models kept the Mavica off my list when acquiring my first digital camera opting instead for the quality laden and feature rich Nikon Coolpix.   However after using a digital camera for over a year it quickly became obvious that digital image storage was a factor which affected the convenience level of the product to a large degree.   


Enhanced Storage

Sony has with the CD1000 gone ahead and taken image storage to the next logical place which is having the image written directly to a CDR within the camera.  This eliminates the inconvenience of having to first fill up your flash memory card and then removing it from the camera and loading it into a card reader or going through the slow process of loading images into your PC through a serial connection to your camera.  The images are burned directly and permanently to CDR on which Sony says digital images will remain in a pristine state for 100 years.  


Features

Viewfinder

The Mavica CD1000 offers both a TTL (Through The Lense) viewfinder and a digital color 2.5� LCD display for framing shots.  There is a brightness control for the LCD screen for adjusted viewing in various light conditions and the digital viewfinder through the eye-hole can be used when light conditions make the LCD unusable. 


Zoom

10x Optical and 20x Digital Zoom is possible with this camera.  A shortcoming with my Nikon digital has always been the poor quality of the digital zoom and the unavailability of optical zoom.  Here Sony has definitely improved the capability of digital zoom with what they term a �Hyper-Precision� CCD (Charged Couple Device) which enhances detail and reduces blurring of zoomed in shots and is a large improvement in quality over some of the digital zoom features of other digital cameras available.  There is a manual focus ring for Optical Zooming as well which provides a familiar feel for 35 mm photographers.

Image Quality

 2.1 megapixels puts this camera on par with medium to high end consumer level products which offers finely detailed images at 1600x1200 which should be enough for any non-professional and suit the needs of professionals whose images will be used in digital format on the web etc.  
  
Auto Orientation Mode and Picture Stabilization

These features simplify use of the camera for both the seasoned camera buff and the casual photo shooter alike.  Optical Steady Shot and Picture Stabilization are Sony features which allow the capturing of quality images without the use of a tripod at shorter exposure times while of course a tripod would still be recommended for maximum quality in any situation where it is able to be used.  Auto Orientation mode is self-explanatory and basically lets the camera quickly choose the best orientation settings for a given shot allowing the photographer to concentrate on obtaining quicker shots of potentially fleeting subjects.


MPEG Movie Capability

Many people have commented that the Mavica CD1000 looks and feels like a Digital Video Camera.  Well in some ways it is as it can be put into MPEG HQ Movie Mode and used to capture MPEG movie segments.   Although these short segments are much more of a novelty than anything useful from a video perspective, a few seconds of video action can really make a scene that would otherwise be still come to life and opens up a new door for people�s creativity, albeit one that may not be oft passed through.  
 

Conclusion

Despite all of the innovation of this camera, I am tempted to feel that the Mavica CD1000 represents what may be in some respects an evolutionary dead end.  With the availability of compact flash memory cards of increasing capacity which can be read through USB card readers into your pc at impressive speeds,  I fail to see a proprietary CD-R based system which cannot reclaim space for deleted images and has to contend with wait times between shots equivalent to the burn time for an image can effectively compete.  Another drawback for the Mavica line has always been size and this camera which weighs in at 2.25 pounds is going against the trend towards smaller and more portable digital camera.  I believe that burning images directly to CD is a novelty which has come just when the CD as a storage medium has begun to pass its zenith.  More versatile flash cards are quickly increasing in capacity enough to enable their becoming the universal  medium for image, video and audio as they by design lend themselves so easily to reuse and portability.  

In summation, the price tag for this camera ($1300.00) for me outweighs its benefits and is a lot to invest in something which may feel obsolete rather quickly.   Sony�s edge has always been on taking existing technology and combining all existing features into one product the downside of which has been a lack of true cutting edge innovation and a greater exposure to possible malfunctions.   For the Mavica CD1000 Sony has combined some existing technologies, but really doesn�t bring anything technologically expansive to the table with this unit.  I feel its novelty will be short lived and I wouldn�t venture to purchase.
