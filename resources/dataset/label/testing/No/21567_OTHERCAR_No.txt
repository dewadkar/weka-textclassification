            My family and I had been looking for a vehicle large enough to travel in with our two children. After looking at several options we chose the Intrepid. The car had 55,000 miles on it when I purchased it and It had been an executive lease vehicle. 
 After checking the car out and finding no problems with it I bought it. After all it drove nice,had very comfortable seats and was very quiet on the road. Not to mention I felt it was a extremely good looking sedan.
  After several months of happy driving I was disturbed one day on my way to work when the drivers power window switch didn't work. By the time I arrived at work the switch then worked this time. I thought well must have been just a fluke. NOPE! Most all of the switches in the car will eventually need replacing. Then shortly thereafter when changing my oil the dipstick handle broke off at the rod. After calling Dodge to get a new one the service man tells me that those break all the time and are basically defective. These things seem somewhat petty I will admit,but when the transmission started jerking when shifting I had this sick feeling in my stomach.  Yes the Dodge Intrepids all have an electronically controlled transmission. So I took it into a transmission specialist who informed me I would need to have the transmission replaced thus $1,800-2000. He informed me that they have replaced many Intrepid transmissions. I believe that friends shouldn't let friends drive Dodge Intrepids. The car looks great but looks can be deceiving. I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone due to the costly maintainience required.<br><br>
