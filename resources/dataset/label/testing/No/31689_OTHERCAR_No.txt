            I purchased a 1998 Grand Prix GT in 1997 and have had nothing but problems since.  The brakes did not function properly, the moonroof was installed incorrectly, the car died 2 times within the first 5 months of owning the vehicle (because of improperly installed cables under the hood), the heads up display constantly rattles, the stitching on the driver and passenger front seats is coming undone, and the list goes on.  After my continued problems, I did more research on the internet and with people I met, and it turns out, everyone I talked to that owned or used to own a 1998 or newer Pontiac Grand Prix had the same problems I did.  I decided to take action and filed a lawsuit with General Motors and my dealership.  I did end up settling to avoid a lengthy court battle, and General Motors had to pay a total of $10,000 ($5,000 to me and $5,000 to my lawyers).  Yes, the Grand Prix seems like a great deal, but unless you happen to get one of the few that is not a lemon, stay away from this car.  There is a reason it is so cheap.<br><br>
