                 I bought my New Beetle with much anticipation and excitement.  I had waited for years to own another Beetle.  My first car was a 1972 Beetle.  I had to have one.  I just didn't like the idea of paying over sticker price.  I finally settled at $595 over sticker, but in exchange I got a spoiler and a CD changer.  
     I am a truly devoted fan of the Beetle, but I am slowly coming to feel a little bitter toward it.  I incurred my first problem about 1 week after buying it.  The CD changer's manual stated there was a shuffle function for all 5 cd's and I followed the instructions to do so.  It was not to be.  I called my dealer who said that the whole section on this in the manual was a typo.  This I never believed but I eventually gave up the fight after speaking to my salesman, the serviceman, and the manager.  Next, about one month after the purchase, my CD player starting skipping.  My dealer replaced it at my first service.  It wasn't 2 months and I needed another new CD changer, and this hasn't stopped.  I can't remember it I have had 5 or 6 new changers.
     By the way, oil changes are included for the first 20,000 miles:  one at 5000, one at 10000, and one at 20000 miles. Somewhere between the 10000 and 20000 change I started noticing my oil wasn't where it should be.  We had to add almost 3 quarts of oil before the next service.  The serviceman said that even though VW says you only need to change the oil every 10000 miles, he would not recommend it and that was the problem with the oil.  
     My car was only about 8 months old when the alarm started malfunctioning.  It would go off for no apparent reason.  It would sometimes go off 3 or more times in an hour.  You could prevent this if the car was unlocked, but I was unwilling to do this.  I brought it in to be fixed in August 2000.  It was returned every month since then for the same problem.  They could not figure out how to fix it.  I got so fed up, I told them to disconnect the crazy thing.  This could not be done.  It would mess up other things.  In August, I also asked them to fix a rear brake light that I was told was out.  They replaced the bulb.  They said.  Guess what?  It still didn't work right.  It continued to malfunction.  It works intermittently.  I have asked them to fix this when it was back in on one of its numerous trips for service of the alarm.  It is still not fixed.  It is now February.  Also, the air conditioner smelled really bad this summer.  It smelled like urine when you first turned it on.  It had to be disinfected this summer.
     Another downfall of this vehicle is not a malfunction, but a nuisance.  There are horrible drink holders. They are located under the dash in front of the gear shift.  I can only fit a can of soda or small drink in there.  Anyone who rides in my car in the back seat has to be careful not to hit there head on the rear hatch, but I don't think the leg room in the back is too bad.
     There are many nice extras on the car.  I love the power side mirror adjusters and the defrost on the side mirror.  I love the way the car handles when you drive.  Although there is a wicked blind spot on both sides by the passenger windows.  The range of adjustments of the seats and steering wheel is nice.
     I would not recommend the black fabric interior.  It shows everything, even after it is just cleaned it looks dirty.  I also don't like the deep dash.  Only because it makes it very hard to clean your windshield.  I cannot do it.  My husband has to wash it and even his arms can barely reach the entire windshield.
     Writing this I wonder why I like my car so much.  I like the way people always stop and ask me about it, and every time I look at it I smile.  Really the cons out weigh the pros.  There is still something about this car.  People who love Beetles know what I am talking about.  I don't think I could recommend this car.  Maybe my experience is caused by a poor service department.  They sure seem to try and fix my car.  They always give me loaners, but still, I have had my Beetle in the shop more than any car I have ever owned.  I have only owned this car for 16 months.
