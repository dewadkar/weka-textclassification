            You don't expect, within a month of purchasing a certified, used Lexus from a flagship dealer, to have to fork out an additional 10% of the purchase cost on fundamental items like a timing belt and brake work. Well, I sure didn't, anyway. (Surprise, surprise!) 

Follow that not so many months later with the sudden death of the seat warmers (in the middle of the winter, of course) and shortly thereafter with an annoying right front strut noise that I had to wind up diagnosing (after two dealers failed in their own efforts) and you get to kiss another $500+ goodbye! 

Interior design is so unimaginative as to be downright criminal in a high-end vehicle. Can someone explain, for example, why they would put so much effort into the hideaway design of the front cup holders only to restrict their diameters and overhead space (due to an over-padded centre armrest) so much that only the smallest and narrowest of cups will fit? 

And what about cellphone use? Considering the target demographic for this vehicle, one would think the centre console would be friendly to cell phone use (yes, we're talking hands-free). Instead, the driver is forced to either commandeer the front ashtray, try and manoeuver around the big transmission knob, keep the cell in his lap, or let it slide wildly about on a convex, slippery, polished centre console. 

Engine power? Yeah, so there's a V8 - and a thirsty beast it is. Just don't expect it to be there in the corners because the car isn't up to compensating. 

Trunk space? Well, it's okay - and just okay, when you take into account we're looking at a limo-level vehicle. 

What about those wiper arms? Whose idea was it to leave so little room for them under the front hood overhang? What a great way to wear the paint off the lip! 

And, speaking of paint and finish? They don't stand up as well to the test of time as one would expect. Chips and scratches down to the metal come easily to this urban-driven car and the would-be sleek black gloss is dulled by thousands of tiny surface scratches that probably embedded themselves just as readily over the years. More so than other cars in my last 15 years of experience.
