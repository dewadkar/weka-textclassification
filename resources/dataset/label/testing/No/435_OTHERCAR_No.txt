            Greetings from an ex-Volvo loyalist. Don't do it. Don't buy a Volvo. Since purchasing new our V70, we have been back to the dealer 11 times in 20k miles. Visit my website to review "Ingrid's List" for the painful details: everything from the door locks and the battery to the burnt-out headlights and fast-blinkers; oh, and did I mention the windshield wiper motor, the tailgate mechanism and all the little pieces that just fall off for no apparent reason?

The problems are NOT mitigated by drivability. My Camry sedan is far more aggressive in the snow. The ABS brakes are just awful: they stutter horribly when you brake on uneven surfaces - or even surfaces. The drive is stiff - okay, it's a wagon - and the acceleration isn't compelling. And it's loud: you can't have the rear windows open when you drive or you can't talk.

I had a 1986 780 GL Turbo which I loved - drove well, felt great on the road and was bulletproof. And Volvo customer service responded when the transmission went at 66k, and although it was past warranty, Volvo replaced it!

This V70 is an utter disappointment. I would like to say that ours is just a lone rotten lemon, but since launching my website, www.myvolvosucks.com, I have heard from many owners whose service problems rival ours. 

Remember: friends don't let friends buy Volvos.
