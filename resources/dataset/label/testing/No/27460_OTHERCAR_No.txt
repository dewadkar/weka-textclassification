            I bought a Neon back in mid-94, just as they were rolling out.  It now has 108,000 miles on it.  It looks a little worse for the wear - dings and scratches here and there -- but is mechanically sound.  The price at the time was less than the Saturn, the Civic, and the Corolla; and it had more horsepower and interior space than any of them.  I have had no real problems with the car at all.  Granted, there are a few rattles now, but the car is 6 years old, and they've all developed over the last year.  All in all, I'd recommend the Neon to anyone who wants a solid, sturdy car without spending a fortune.  In fact, when the time comes I'll probably buy another Neon.<br><br>
