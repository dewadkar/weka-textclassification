            I love the design of this car.  It's cab forward design, easy to read dash, and handling is excellent.  Even in winter driving, it handles very nice.  I love the room inside also.  It looks small on the outside, but is roomy enough to fit a family of 4 nicely.  

On the back roads where bumps are present, you feel every one.  The suspension as a lot to be desired.  I would say if the car has less than 30-40,000 miles on it, the car would be fine.  Anything over that 40,000 mile mark IS NOT WORTH IT.  

The head gaskets are known to go bad.  The fly wheels are also a common problem.  I just finished putting $1200 into mine for the gasket and flywheel.  And of course, Dodge has made it impossible to work on, all the parts have to be directly ordered from them.  Our mechanic has seen 5 so far just within the last 12 months with the same problems.  

If you have a lot of money to blow, and don't mind being upset at Dodge, you should buy this car, otherwise, find another model!  (My mechanic calls this engine a glorified motor cycle engine)<br><br>
