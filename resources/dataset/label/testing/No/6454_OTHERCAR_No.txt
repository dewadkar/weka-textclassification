            I purchased my car in 1995 and LOVED it.  I purchased my Camry with the expectation that I would have a quality vehicle that was dependable and comfortable.  My problems began in 1999 when I began having oil leaks despite regular oil changes.  Now perhaps it was the Toyota Dealer I took it to for repairs that caused the extensive damage which led to the need to replace the entire engine but none the less it was not my expectation that I would have to replace the engine!!!  Not only was I without my car for 4 months, I received NO assistance from corporate Toyota.  I was told by the Toyota representative and her supervisor that I needed to retain the services of a lawyer as they did not want to intervene with the dealer.  Very disappointing.  In addition, there have been several little annoyances.  For instance,  the moon-roof clips have deteriorated over the years and the frame of the moon-roof rattles.  I cannot put a CD in the second slot of the 3 slot CD changer as those CDs mysteriously become scratched.  I had to have the CD/stereo display replaced as well as the motor in one of the power windows.  The antenna also had to be replaced because the motor quit working.  Overall my experience with a Toyota Camry was not what I expected and quite disappointing.  I will not purchase a Toyota product again.
