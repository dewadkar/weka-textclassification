            I've had my Tribute since 9/23/00, have taken it on several road trips, and drive it 45 miles RT every day to work.

It's very stylish--much more attractive than Mercedes or Lexus SUV.

Other pluses:

ZOOM:  Wonderful acceleration (even at high altitude), great sporty feel to it.  

ROOM:  My 6' husband has plenty of leg and headroom--even with a cowboy hat on. Much roomier than it looks.

HANDLING:  This is my first "non sports car" ever, and the Tribute made the transition painless.  I feel completely confident even in heavy snow--something you can't say for a sports car!

TOYS: Love the in-dash 6-CD player. Love the 1-touch sunroof.    
 
Cons:

Lotsa little problems. Recalled O-ring and wipers (fixed); back hatch rattled (fixed); under-dash trim loose (part took 3 weeks, fixed).  Gearshift blocks other controls.

BIGGEST problem: wind noise through both front windows. Complained since day 1, replaced two parts in each door, to no avail. Now looking for after-market replacement mirrors that I will have to buy.  Also LOTS of little rattles--in the speakers, the overhead console, the doors, the dash...and that's after only 1 year of 5 miles/day on a gravel road.  I shudder to think how much it will be later on--or if, heaven forbid, you actually took it 4-wheeling?!?!  Seems like an SUV *ought* to be put together better!
 
Overall Review:
I've always driven sports cars before, and this is the least painful way to transition to something suitable for where and how I live (i.e. a 4WD vehicle with clearance and a little room for hubby). Had a Grand Vitara XL-7 as a loaner, and Trib handles better and looks better. A friend has a Subaru Forester, and I also think the Trib outdoes that hands down. Styling is great; acceleration, handling, and stopping are phenomenal; incredible room; lots of toys. But unless you want to keep the stereo at maximum volume ALL the time, the rattles, squeaks, bumps, and pins will drive you CRAZY!  I'd hold out for the Saturn VUE.
