            Yeah this car's cheap - but as they say, you get what you pay for. Considering that most decent sub-compacts start at least a few thousand more than the Sephia, it seems a bit weary.
I speak from experience, living in misery with this piece of junk until I can afford something better. While the car gets decent mileage and is pretty comfortable, it is also put together very poorly. The car is very easy to break into. Many owners I have seen have also had many brake problems, mine have even locked up on the freeway, which is not a good thing. The doors are also not sturdy, as the plastic molding that is the inside of the door can become separated if you are the kind of person who slams the door too hard. The locks are also have problems, especially those that have power locks, as they get stuck and you can't get out of the car and then you have to pull a &quot;Duke's of Hazzard&quot; to get out.
Please save yourself the pain and money. This car is not a lemon, but a mildewed one.<br><br>
