            I have owned 3 chevy blazers. Each time I swore I would never buy another one. Then when I would start looking, I couldn't find anything else in which I liked the looks. Well, I bought a Jeep Cherokee for my wife this year, and I can promise you that when my blazer goes this time, Jeep will sell another one. My biggest problem with chevy has been the service. GM has done a poor job of keeping their customers happy. My current blazer is noisy and drives poorly, but my biggest concern is the brakes. After I purchased it, the brake pedal went all the way to the floor at a red light the second week I owned it. I almost hit another car. I took it to the shop where I was told there was nothing wrong. The same thing happened 5, I repeat five other times. Each time the shop told me the same thing. Finally I was forced to live with the fact that I might die in this thing, because I could not afford to trade it in. Months after my last complaint, I saw a DateLine report which reported a defect in the brakes that caused them to do what mine were doing. They reported numerous accidents because of this defect. The dealer then again told me there was nothing wrong with the brakes. I started reporting this same problem long before the Dateline report, but GM says we are crazy. My previous blazer had a rattle in the tailgate that was louder than the stereo. The dealer acknowledged the rattle but could not figure out how to fix it. They had a representative from GM look at it and he concluded the same thing. There was a problem but they did not know how to fix it. They finally said I would have to live with it. I called GM and spoke with the assistant to the President, who I might add is very rude. After telling him my story, he said that all I could do is take it back to the dealer and let them check the problem again. I asked for a loaner car, since I had already taken it in 6 times for the same problem and was told it could not be fixed. I was told that was not an option. I did take it back in and was told the same thing, it can't be fixed. These are just a couple of problems I have had. I could go on and on and on, but you get the point. All I can say is goodbye GM, hello JEEP.<br><br>
