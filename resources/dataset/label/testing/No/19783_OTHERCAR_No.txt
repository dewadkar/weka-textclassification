            I leased a 1996 Volkswagen Golf for 4 years (too bad the warranty was only 2 years at the time, and that was all they offered).  I couldn't wait to turn this car in.

This car was plagued with problems from the start.  I thought all these years I'd just gotten a lemon, but after reading the other reviews, I realize that I basically got what many other people got - a poorly built car.  I also think the reason that the people who work for Volkswagen are so rude and obnoxious is because they are so busy working on crappy cars day after day that they can't help but be aggravated.  Anyway, here's what happened to my car during the life of the lease:

1)  Side moldings fell off about 6 times.  The final straw, since Volkswagen could never seem to get it to stay on, was my purchasing super, crazy, industrial, mega-glue and gluing them on myself.  After that, they never fell off again!

2) Key lock literally fell out of the door.

3) Sunroof constantly squeaked and Volkswagen could never agree on why or how to fix it.  I lived with it for 4 years.

4) Transmission broke down after 2 years and had to be replaced.  Took them 2 weeks to fix this problem.

5) Radio had to be replaced once after liquid crystals disappeared in the display.

6) Car never stayed aligned.  Had to replace all tires after 24,000 miles because of constant mis-alignment (and I didn't go off-roading with this thing either).

7) Reflectors in front of the car had to be replaced 10,000 times because they kept falling off.  They fell off in the car wash, fell off driving, fell off just sitting there quietly on the side of the road.  

8) Check Engine light was lit approximately 3 1/2 out of the 4 years I had that car.  It was always the oxygen sensor that kept dying, which had to be replaced 3 times.  I actually turned the car in with the damn light lit the last time, I was totally sick of the oxygen sensor thing by then.

9) Brakes had to be done every year.  Most of the parts for this car had to be purchased at Volkswagen because most stores don't carry parts for Volkswagens, which I didn't know until I actually had to end up buying so many parts all the time.  I think the brakes had to be done so much because they make such crappy parts and you have to keep replacing them all the time.  I never had a car before or after this one that needed brakes like this car did.

I spent a lot of money on this car, because as I said, the warranty only covered the first 2 years.  I suggest if you plan on purchasing this car to inquire about the warranty period, which I think is longer now.  You don't want to have to put out money for stupid things, especially on a leased car.

The service people at all the dealerships where I had the car serviced were rude and very unhelpful.  When I had the transmission problem, it took one dealership 1 month to get me a loaner car, as I had to be put on a waiting list because they didn't have any available.  Most dealerships told me they didn't give loaner cars at all.  Driving around on a bad transmission for a month is not good, as you can imagine, so they ultimately blamed me for the transmission problem.  It didn't matter that I had no other car to drive and HAD to drive it to the point of completely ruining whatever was still good about the transmission.  Also, waiting times were atrocious at all dealerships I had the misfortune to visit, they never washed the car after servicing it and usually tried to get me to purchase expensive, unnecessary service, probably because I'm female and think I don't know any better.

The funniest thing about Volkswagen was how they called me constantly with surveys on my satisfaction with the car, the service, etc.  This started about 1 week into my lease. However, the surveys stopped about 6 months later and they never called again.  But in the first 6 month time period, they must've called about 10 times.  Of course everyone loves their new car for the first 6 months of ownership, try calling 1 or 2 years later and see if their opinion is still the same....

And on a final note - I thought it was funny when Volkswagen started giving away cars with a Trek mountain bike.  You know the bike is for all the many times your car will be in the shop and they won't have a loaner car for you.  At least you'll still be able to get to work....
