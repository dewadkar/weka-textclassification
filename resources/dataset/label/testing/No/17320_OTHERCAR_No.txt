            I need to be honest with you; this article is about the subjective topic of styling, and little else. But before I start hearing mouse clicks from around the world, please give me an opportunity to explain myself. I promise, if you are considering the new Lexus LS430, you should read this article. Many people will tell you, that styling virtue is all in the eye of the beholder and that when it comes right down to it, quality and performance are what, in the long run, counts. This is a very valid, but shortsighted point. You see, when a vehicle is being developed, every element that touches the senses, from the appearance of trim parts, to the feel of the steering wheel, to the smell of the upholstery, to the sound of the exhaust, is carefully scrutinized to ensure the ideal affect. The more expensive the car is, generally, the more care that is given to its development. Now that we understand that each and every line of the body is so delicately placed, doesn�t it stand to reason, that the designers who developed the sensory aspects of the car, should be held accountable for the result? I don�t mean that they should be forced to sleep in the dowdy headliner material that they specified. I simply mean that people should not view style so passively, and should be vocal enough about their opinions, that the designers can hear it. I am a designer, by education, and I can tell you that ten different designers will give you ten different design philosophies. All of these designers, including the ones who design the cars we drive, have perfectly logical, concept driven opinions about the way their product needs to be styled. Sometimes execution is indeed poor. However, with the LS430, I don�t believe this is the case. I believe that this car became precisely what it was supposed to be, and very successfully, I might add.  It�s the mentality behind these decisions that I believe is poor, and it telescopes right through to the final product. I also believe that the defects in the LS430�s concept and subsequent appearance are actually enough to unseat it as a notable choice in this price category.  Stick around and I will explain.

To truly understand the LS430, we must start at the very beginning. Premium makes are not a new concept, but until the late 1980�s, could not be pulled off successfully. In 1986, Honda ignited this whole powder keg with the inception of its new premium make, Acura. The cars, two at first, felt like high content versions of normal Honda�s. A network of dealers was established including an advanced new service department. With all the money spent training technicians and building premium facilities, they all set around play cards because there simply were no recalls, repairs, or problems of any sort. The new Acuras just wouldn�t break. With the concept firmly in place, Toyota knew the time was right to launch their premium make (which was already in development at the time).
Anyone who is shopping for a premium luxury sedan today owes a debt of gratitude to the LS400. When it was released in 1989, the market for this sort of car was painfully dull. The premium American makes had nothing to offer but apologies. BMW�s 3 and 5 series sedans were really its forte, leaving the 7 series a touch uncompetitive. Jaguar had not yet been blessed with an acquisition from Ford and was producing mediocrity personified. The reigning king of this segment, Mercedes Benz, was duping unsuspecting buyers into forking over $50-$70K for ten year old technology. The problem was that manufacturers like Mercedes, had no competition, and were unwilling to make any improvements to their products. Lexus changed all of that. Suddenly, the Europeans had a new competitor. The LS400 was as sleek and stylish as the guys from across the pond, plus it performed better and cost up to 20 grand less. In terms of content and comfort, the V8 LS was more in line with the 500 series Mercedes but was actually cheaper than their mid level, 6-cylinder 300E. Plus, the interior was smooth, elegant, and comfortable, unlike the cold, Teutonic harshness of the Germans. Styling was clearly a Mercedes Benz derivative, but nobody seemed to care. Sales were magnificent, and the competition scrambled to catch up. For 1995, Lexus scrapped the entire appearance of the LS, by restyling each body panel and the interior. But the result yielded a car that looked nearly identical to the former generation. Critics and fans alike were a bit disappointed, but the car also gained an additional 10 horsepower for a total of 260, and was smoother than ever, so everyone accepted the changes with approval. In my opinion, the 99� LS400 flew very close to perfection. Satellite navigation was added, structural integrity improved, and an additional 30 horses materialized under the hood. The humdrum styling from 95� finally fell into place with the uses of bright, polished aluminum wheels, and stunning new headlamp treatment. Now, for 2001, the new LS is hitting the market, dubbed the LS430 do to a change in engine displacement from 4.0-liters to 4.3-liters.

When I mentioned that this article was about styling, I expressed this because that is the only issue I have with the new LS. In every other way, the car is shear perfection. From the ideal ergonomics, stylish interior appointments, precise road performance, faultless structural integrity, and volley of helpful technological aids, the car seems to be a statistical wonder. Power is smooth and any hardships the car suffers on the road are hidden from the passengers through flawless suspension design and a vault-like fuselage. Also, the leather upholstery is of a quality that Rolls Royce should make note of. But for the $55,000 base price, the potential buyer is privy to many cars that can offer the same levels of sophistication and have a unique concept, style, and appearance. For the last generation LS to be a Mercedes-Benz derivative was quite forgivable. Toyota was a proverbial fish out of water in this segment and sticking to a safe formula was acceptable. But why now?
After years of accolades and success, Lexus had the opportunity to add excellence in styling to their lengthy list of accomplishments. Instead, however, they choose to stick with the same, safe formula that had brought them so much prior success; to steal from the leader. From the shape of the head and tail lamps, to the mid-body seaming with chrome accent strips, to the slope-nose/high rear deck theme, the car is plagiarizing Mercedes-Benz worse than Ray Parker Jr. did to Huey Lewis. I could go on and on, too. The optional aluminum rims are poorly executed bootlegs, and the fuel filler door is in the same spot, only on the opposite side of the car. Even the door handles look very similar. The whole effect feels like an unimaginative, and poorly fused together compilation of 2/3�s current generation S-Class, and 1/3 last generation S-Class. I am not simply being overly sensitive, either. Even an average car buyer with no leanings toward the design industry will not be able to help looking at the two cars side by side, and wondering which came first. To make matters worse, the color palette of the new LS is as bland as ever, and the standard wheel rim looks like a bad plastic wheel cover from a mid 90�s Hyundai Elantra. Though the styling is blatantly stolen, Lexus was unable to achieve the smooth, elegance of the new S-Class, leaving the LS looking somewhat anonymous. 

As marvelous as the LS is in every other way, I feel that for the money, I should be privileged to a car that looks unique, and that doesn�t resort to thievery to achieve success. In the $50,000-$60,000 dollar range, buyers have the option of the Audi A6 4.2, which features even better on road performance through a more powerful V8 and all wheel drive. Let us also not forget the muscular reflexes of BMW�s 540i, elegance of Cadillac�s STS, or grace of the Jaguar XJ series. Or, one could also consider the less expensive Infiniti Q45, Acura RL, or Volvo S80 T-6. Also, Lexus thought enough of Mercedes to copy them, so perhaps they are worth a look. $55,000 will seat you in a well optioned E-Class, and a mere $15 grand more moves you into the S430 with a gentle Italian interior to which the LS cannot even compare. 

The bottom line is that while the Lexus LS430 is a marvelous piece of engineering, it isn�t the only one out there. The market place is not what it was when the first LS400 hit the streets. I believe that the ideologies of content and engineering over style and design that set the first generation apart, will in this iteration LS, not serve the car well. In contrast to 1989, excellence in engineering is now a standard expectation in this price class, not a novel concept. That said the 2001 LS is left as just another face in the crowd.
