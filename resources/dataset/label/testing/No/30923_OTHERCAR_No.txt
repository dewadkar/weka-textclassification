              My husband and I purchased a new 1996 chrysler sebring in 1997.  Right off the bat there was a problem with the front bumper.  We took it in and the dealership assured us that an item, used for shipping, had been left on the underneath portion of the bumper.  They assured us that this was the problem and that everything should be fine.
  Since then we have had nothing but problems with the front bumper and parking. The front bumper WILL NOT clear any of the cement parking blocks.  In fact the bumper has bent, pulled etc...on these parking blocks.  When we complained to the dealership the answer they gave was that this was a sports car and that is just the way they are designed.   My husband ownes a Firebird and has never had this problem.  We called chrysler headquarters only to have them patronize us as well.
  We are unbelievably unhappy with the chrysler sebring and chrysler!  Everytime I hear or see an advertisment for chrysler &quot;ENGINEERED TO BE GREAT CARS&quot; I get so angry.  We purchased this vehicle trusting that this car would indeed be a car engineered to be great.  Instead we have been ignored and pushed aside.  
  When people ask us how we like our car, because it is a nice looking car, we calmly take them to the front on the car and explain about the unaceptable clearing problem, they are horrified.  So I drive this nice looking car around with the front bumper looking terrible, since chrysler has told us time and again that there is nothing wrong with the clearing then this car will be a billboard for the engineering they seem to be standing behind.
  I would like to know if there are others out there with the same problem as we have been facing.  I regret everyday buying a chrysler and will guarantee that I along with others will never purchase another one again.<br><br>
