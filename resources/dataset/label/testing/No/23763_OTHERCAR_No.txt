            I bought one of these just as I was leaving Charleston, SC in 1998.  I'm in the Navy and was moving myself across the US to WA.  Our &quot;current&quot; car was a 1989 Nissan Sentra but we'd heard about how well Saturn's are.  We also talked w/ retirees who bought Saturn's because they could tow the car behind their RV w/o having to do anything special to the car; just put it in neutral and away you go.

We traded in our Nissan for the Saturn.  It was used but in relatively good condition for the mileage it had (75k).  We drove it in Charleston for about 2 weeks before we left; no major complaints.  We did get scammed by the Saturn dealer when we took it in for a tune-up.  I had bought some platinum spark plugs and was going to change them myself, but my wife wanted to see if there was anything else wrong w/ the car.  The dealer said that we needed new spark plugs (duh) _and_ new spark plug cables and something else.  When I told him that I had just bought spark plugs for it, he said, &quot;Oh no, you can't use platinum spark plugs w/ this car.  It was designed to use only a standard GM copper spark plug.  The platinum plugs won't work.&quot;  My wife believed him so the dealer sold us the plugs and cables; luckily he let me install them myself, it would have cost almost $70 for the dealer to do it.  He also tried to get us to buy a new timing chain, over though the chain is rated for over 100,000 miles (if I remember correctly).

After we moved to WA, we started having problems w/ the car, losing power and leaking oil.  We called the Saturn dealer to make an appointment, but the nearest dealer was in Tacoma (we live in Bremerton, 45 minutes away).  Saturn told us to take it to a local Subaru dealer that was &quot;qualified&quot; to work on Saturns.  When we took the car in, Subaru told us we needed all the engine hoses replaced and the head gasket replaced.  It took almost a month to get the correct part from Saturn; they sent the wrong part the first time.  The whole repair cost over $1200.  

In addition to the problems w/ the engine, the Saturn dealer neglected to inform us that not only are the door panels plastic, but so is the rest of the interior.  Here's a list of what broke:

*The vents on the dash fell out 
*The fuse box cover tab broke off 
*The door frame cover retaining pins broke off 
*The ash trays fell out 
*The automatic seat belt rails leaked everytime it rained 
*And the seat back latch broke

None of the problems w/ the car were due to us or the previous owners.  Talking w/ other Saturn owners, it's apparently normal &quot;wear &amp; tear&quot;.  Presumably, as the Saturn gets much past 3-4 years, the plastic parts just can't handle it and start to break.

The final comments I have are w/ the car in general.  The engine has no power, especially on hills or w/ AC running.  The tires aren't &quot;normal&quot; size; you can't buy the tires at most tire stores but have to buy from the dealer at $60-$70 per tire.  And finally, the spare is kept in a bad spot; ours fell off the mounting bracket and exploded from rubbing against a piece of metal in the trunk.<br><br>
