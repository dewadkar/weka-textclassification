            I currently own a 98 Dodge Dakota Sport with a regular cab.  It has the 2.5L 4-cylinder engine with 5 speed manual shift, which is good on small cars, but not on this truck.  It's not very fast, so if your looking for a first car for someone who likes to go fast this is it.  If you�re thinking of getting a Dakota for yourself spend the extra money for a larger motor.

This model also only has 2 wheel drive so winter driving tends to be a bit tricky unless you like to spin donuts in the parking lot, its good for that.  It never had any mechanical problem up to this point I'm at about 70k miles now, got the truck with 60k on it.  It has a 6' bed which is handy, can fit lots of stuff back there. Don't try cramming in 3 adults in the cab, it's not fun being jammed together against each other, it only fits 2 with the tiny middle seat.  

Other than that it runs good, hasn't let me down yet and it has good sleek looks to it.  It has 2-bucket seats in the front, which are somewhat comfortable.  Stereo is loud, and has driver and passenger airbags.  I haven't tried to tow anything yet so can't compliment on that.  

Over all it�s a nice small truck but not something I'd want to keep for the long haul.
