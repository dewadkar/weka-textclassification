            I bought one in Jan 1998. It worked well for about 9 months and then died.I mailed it back to have it serviced. After about 8 weeks it came back working fine with a 90 day warrantee on the repairs. Five months later the same problem occurred. I was told it was not under warrantee any more and it would cost $165 To fix it. I told them to keep it. Recently, I told this story to a friend and he had the same problem with the same model. His was trash too. I went out and bought aKodak dc210 and love it.<br><br>
