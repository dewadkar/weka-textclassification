            Last time I give a u.s. car a chance with my money.
Let's face it, A car is the 2nd largest purchase any of us will ever make.
Yes, the car does handle well, As any little car should (exception-cavalier and escort). But, if it feels like the steering wheel is about to brake off in your hand, Yikes! I thought I would give the American car companies one more chance (After getting nickeled and dimed to death with a Chevy Nova). BIG MISTAKE. 
I don't care if it is covered by a warranty, I need to drive my car, Not get fat on donuts at the dealership. I think I saw 2 out of 3 cars getting fixed were Neons. 
This is corporate Greed at it's finest hour. Taking advantage of young people, with neeto advertising.
2 of my friends bought a Honda, and after a Year of stuff falling apart, I did the same. Trim pieces fell off. The tranny wouldn't go into reverse.
1 of the speakers died. Fuses kept blowing etc. etc. etc.........
Goodbye Dodge........Hello Honda.<br><br>
