            I had one of these plastic wonders as a company vehicle, and even though it had over 150,000 miles, it still drove pretty well, that is when it ran or even started.

This was GM's first attempt to catch up with Chrysler in the wooing of moms across the nation.  the plastic body panels were to make it kiddie proof from collisions with juniors big wheel. It does that well as small dents don't show on the body, but results in creaking plastic moaning on the mounts over every bump in the road.

Overall the vehicle drives well.  It steers and handles OK, and the automatic transmission shifts smoothly.  The air conditioning is also the best one that I have seen using R134a refrigrant.  Those are two things no other auto maker has seem to beat GM at and that is transmissions and air conditioning, but just those two bright spots do not a world beater vehicle make.  First off, the sharply shaped nose makes it impossible to know exactly where the front of the vehicle is.  It is shaped like the cow catcher on a train, and driving the van, you could hit a cow and not even know it.  It also makes engine service a real chore that I would not want to wish on the worst of mechanics.

My particular vehicle had a mind of its own, telling me when it would run and when it wouldn't.  When it first occurred I had a mechanic pull the codes from the computer, and was informed that the computer was setting codes a mile long, so it would be just a guess as to what the problem was.  I took it to an independent highly regarded GM mechanic, and was informed it was either the coil pack, the crank position sensor, or the computer.  They kept it a week and tried to get it to cut off, and when it did, the determined it was the coil pack.  After paying $400, I was on my way, only to travel 300 miles and stop to use the phone to come back to the vehicle to find it would not start again.  If you waited for it to cool down, it would usually restart and run fine.  Seeing how I was selling auto parts at the time, I used this van to call on garages, and I am a fairly good mechanic.  A check of the computer codes indicated that it had reset all the previously set codes, so I concluded that the computer had gone bad.  I purchased a "remanufactured" computer from the GM dealer and replaced it.  This fix lasted two weeks.  I was in a customer's and he pulled the codes once again, and this indicated that it was the crank position sensor, so I told him to put one on.  He called around and no one had one in stock, which is amazing seeing how this vehicle had the 3.8 liter GM V6 that was the most popular engine in the entire GM fleet.  I finally took it to the Chevrolet dealer and they kept the vehicle a week, but could not figure out what was wrong.  The service manager told me that if it were his vehicle he would just get rid of it!!!  Finally they replaced the sensor and that seemed to have cured it.

Another bad feature is the plastic wheel covers, with the plastic bolts that hold them to the wheel.  These freeze to the lugs and you have to break the wheel cover just to get the things off.  I tried to replace the spark plugs and the center rear is impossible to remove from either the top of the engine or the bottom.  When I got rid of this vehicle it had 5 new spark plugs, and one original one.

I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for mine.
