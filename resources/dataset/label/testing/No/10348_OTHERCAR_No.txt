            This is not my car but my fianc�e&#146s.  We are a few months away from getting married, and we have decided to consolidate cars.  For the record I own a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 with no options, and she owns the 2001 Toyota Corolla that is completely loaded.  Since my fianc�e does not drive stick, our choices are keep the corolla, or get a different car.  For financial reasons I want to keep the Corolla, but she cannot wait to get rid of it.  I thought she just wanted a new car, but now after having driven the Corolla over the past month I totally agree with her that we need to sell this car.  Growing up we had a 1986 Chevy Nova (basically a Corolla), which I though was a decent little car.  You'd think Corollas would have advanced, but I was amazed at how similar if felt to the old '86 Nova

I have never liked this Corolla, and neither has my future wife.  My biggest complaint about this car is its handling.  This car handles worse than the full size Oldsmobile station wagon I learned to drive on.  We took the car on a trip to Lake Tahoe, and were unable to keep up with the SUVs on the twisty mountain roads.  Whenever it rains the car feels like it is about to spin out of control.  The rear brakes lock up very easily on wet roads, and make us both very nervous about driving it.  The car does not have anti-lock brakes.  On windy Highways it is difficult to control.

I think a lot of the handling problems are related to the tires it came with.  Replacing these tires would probably solve some of the handling ills.

The only thing worse than driving the car is riding in it as a passenger.  For some reason the front passenger seat makes both of our legs go numb after only a half hour of driving.  Added to that is the feeling of impending death if an accident should occur.  For the record I have ridden in base Corolla of the same year and the seats were way more comfortable.  

By comparison my Focus is way better to drive and ride in.  Even though it is a base model it feels plusher than the loaded Corolla.

The styling of both the interior and exterior are bland cheap looking.  Neither of us get very excited about the car.

OK, now something good to say.  This car feels cheap, but seems well constructed.  I have no doubt it will last a long time, and provide excellent reliability, as it has for us.  The fuel mileage is also quite good.  It is noticeably better than my Focus even though it is a bigger car.  The engine seems decent but not great.  It provides decent oomph off the line, but dies off as the RPMs increase.

Perhaps the best thing about the car is resale value and desirability among the general population.  We had absolutely no trouble getting people interested in buying the car for a decent rate.  By contrast I don't seem to be able to give my Focus away.  Toyota's reputation for build a reliable car has certainly helped us here.

Despite all this we are still getting rid of the car.  Why live with a car that we hate driving, and that feels unsafe.  I'm sure it will provide good service for the next owner.
