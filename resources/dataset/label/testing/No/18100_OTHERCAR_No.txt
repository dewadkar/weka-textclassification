            In early 1996, i purchased a dodge neon.  Shortly thereafter, i had to replace the throttle casing, the throttle cable, the radio, and all of the spark plugs due to defects.  Luckily, the car was still under warrenty at this time and only had around 15,000 miles.  Recently, i've had to have a new head gasket put on.  Now most are telling me at this point that you have to do repairs to your car and i agree.  The problem is that all of these items where defective parts that chrysler did notify me about.  Several models and years of neon's have these defects and chrysler is not telling anyone but the service mechanics in their shops.  To replace the head gasket was an estimate of $400-$1,000.  Which luckily, my service mechanic is only going to charge me a 1/4 of that price.  However, i feel that if it is a known problem, that is recognised by the dealer, then all owners should be notified and buyers made aware.  Because no one likes being left on the side of the road at night by themselves because of something the dealer or mechanic should have warned them about.<br><br>
