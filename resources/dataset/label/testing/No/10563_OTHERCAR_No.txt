            I do want to make clear that I'm not giving this opinion in relation to ALL Integras.  Mine might have just been a lemon.  

The Integra I bought was a used 1995 4-door sedan. The car had low mileage and was in very good condition when I bought it (or so I thought).
The ride and feel of this car was the best thing about the sedan and I liked driving it.  This would probably be due to the great engine torque and horsepower which made this car very exciting to drive. 
The overall build of the sedan was also good, but that's about as far as my good comments go.  
Shortly after I bought the car the air conditioning went out.  I took it in, got it fixed, and then it went out AGAIN.  So, that makes a problem with the A/C breaking twice in two years.
The Exterior of the car was just as much a problem.  After I had the car for less than a year, the paint began to chip on the back bumper.  This was definitely an eye sore and something that I do not expect to see from a 3 year old car.  
Overall, I would recommend the car to others, with the warning to expect some slight problems within the early years of the car's life.  I would also say that these issues I have with the Integra may only be affecting the later year cars and I'm sure Acura has put many of these problems to rest by now.<br><br>
