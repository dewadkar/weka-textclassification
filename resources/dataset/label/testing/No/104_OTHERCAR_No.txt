            I have never been taken with the appearance of any of the Suzuki products. However, I test drove the Suzuki XL-7 with leather seating while shopping for a mid-size SUV for my wife. I was impressed with the ride and handling until I noticed my hinder regions were getting a bit sore after 20 minutes! This is either a sign of seats that are too hard, or my rear is too sensitive. I'll let you decide that issue for yourself. The 183 HP V6 is just adequate to get this SUV moving. Don't expect anyone to be impressed with the acceleration, especially at higher speeds.  

On the other hand, I thought the dash layout was nicely done, although it looked early 90's to me. Controls for the radio and AC/Heating were adequate but also somewhat dated in appearance. Finding a good driving position was easy in spite of the hard and somewhat smallish seats. I have an issue with the H/L 4-WD shifter location, however. It would be very easy for a child or pet to move the shifter out of 2H to 4H. As is typical in older style 4-WD vehicles with a low range selector, one must slow to a virtual crawl or stop in order to place the  XL-7 in 4-Low. The rear seats require three steps to fold that are not intuitive, and thus appear less well thought out in design. 

There's plenty of room with the second row of seats in the raised position and a huge amount of room with the seats down. I tested the capacity of the rear cargo area using two chest-style coolers, three of your typical suitcases in extra-large, large and medium sizes, and a portable wheelchair. The XL-7 handled this with ease. Normally the view out the rear window is blocked by the full sized spare, so I didn't lose much in the area of visibility. I did not like the fact that the rear window could not be opened and the odd design shared by the CRV, of the door opening toward the curb. I think it should be the other way around, especially for dropping people off with luggage at say...the airport?

Overall, I like the vehicle. It would be more to my liking if the seats were comfortable and the ride was less truck-like. Another strike against this vehicle is the lack of 4 wheel disc brakes. The rear wheels have drum brakes, which are adequate, but very old technology. Braking is easy to modulate, but reaction seems a bit slow. I'd bet the drum brakes accentuate that.

<b> Update </b>

I've discovered a few more reasons why I'm glad I didn't opt for the XL-7. Namely:

     The gas tank is situated aft of the rear axle, a serious safety design flaw. As a result, the rear seat in the seven passenger version is situated directly over this tank with no easy egress for the rearmost passengers in an emergency.

As a sidenote: I've seen several of these around town and I must say, I do find the dark colored versions to be more attractive from the side than the lighter colored versions.
