            With much anticipation I received my Impala SS with only 23k miles on the clock. THe first thing I noticed was the lack of acceleration. With everyone touting the "Vette" motor, I was expecting something fast. I had Mr Goodwrench take a look and all checked well except for some oil leaks that I had them fix. Seems that this car may have a detuned Vette motor, but it is so heavy that any type of acceleration is hampered by this mass. Other than that, the brakes and handling certainly could of used some tuning. It floats like a boat and does not instill any type of confidence around corners. On the plus side this thing is huge and can carry 4 adults comfortably. I went into the purchase with the impression that I was getting a sports sedan. I now realize that what the car is is a nice Caprice with a bigger motor and some badging. Do not expect more then this and you will be satisfied. I was not.
