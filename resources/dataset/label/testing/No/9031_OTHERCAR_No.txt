            I loved the Sportage the first time I seen it! I traded my 94' firebird in on it even though I didn't get all of it paid off. I signed my life away.
The first time I drove it I took it right back to the KIA dealer because it was pulling slightly to the right! They did a alignment said everything was fine now.
I was back because it was still doing it and there was wind coming in from the front windshield. They checked my air pressure in my ties and they order new weather-striping for my front doors for the wind noise.
I was back they replaced the weather-stripping and took the KIA for a teat drive and said nothing was wrong with it. The service manger stated that all KIA's are made to follow the road and all the roads are made to the right. And the wind noise is coming from the wind whipping around the mirrors even though I feel the wind coming in!
So after all this I wrote to the main KIA dealer , to give them their last chance to fix the problem. And informed Lemon Law.
I was back for the last time and this time my husband had to argue with the service manger about it.the service manger was very unprofessional.
He said nothing is wrong with it. So they did nothing to it!
Now I already went to BBB arbitration and they ruled to give KIA a another chance to fix it. I refused it! Now I have to go to Florida State Arbitration! I also had to get a lawyer, that cost me $800!
 KIA claims that it from neglect,abuse or an accident! They say that KIA's are easily knocked out of alignment just by hitting a curve, even though they are suppose to be an off road SUV! They are also saying that the problem isn't a safety hazzard! Even though It's hard enough to kept it straight when a car passes or the wind is blowing, I have to keep both hands on steering wheel and I'm scared to death! I have a 4 yr old son that I have to check on in the back seat!VERY UNSAFE! It burns up gas like a 6cyl! 

Up Date!! I Won my case and I had it paid off! <br><br>
