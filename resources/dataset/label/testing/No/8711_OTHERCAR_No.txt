            Honda Really did something incredible when they redisgned the Accord coupe.  Unlike other coupe on the market it's body style is more sleek and sporty for a car under $30,000 dollars than the rest of it's competition.  

I have had my 2000 Honda Accord for almost a year and I love it so much I havent even had a single problem with the vehicle, that is something you expect from the maker Honda. The only problem with this car is the amount of head turning you will recive from passing motorist.  It is not a good family car unless you young ones are old anuf to climb into the back seat.  It would be hard to get car seat in and out of the back.  

The performance of the vehicle is great it handles like a small sports car and has realtivly good acceleration.  And with all wheel disc breaks stoping is made easy. Everything in the inside compartment is easy to opperate and to find with out any trouble.  

I would highly reccomend this car it is a true beauty.
