            I bought the 95 Neon about 6 months after its release. It appeared to be a good value, with the most bells and whistles for the price. I compared it to a Chevrolet model, the Toyota Tercel and Corolla, and the Honda Civic.

The neon had the best looks and the most features for the price. However, the big disappointment with this car is the annoying details. Windows that seem to let air in, brakes that squeak, rattles and noise. I have also had technical disappointments, seals that leaked and more than one air conditioning failure.

However, the car, in its 5th year, continues to run reliably and perform well in the most basic sense. It runs well. The body has held up nicely, and the styling is still attractive, better than the more boring style of even some of the new cars out there.

I hate the annoying details, mostly the noise and the occasionally squeaking brakes. But, I love that it now has taken me over 115,000 miles with almost no problems, except the annoying noise! And the back door lock that never seems to open all the way with the auto locks. 

I can live with the fact that I bought a cheap car. I recommend that new car buyers should go for high product quality. Now this car, five years old, may be great for a kid who needs to get around. I have confidence that this car will take me another 2-3 years with not much to worry about - except the noise! Oh well, turn up the radio.
