            I bought my dodge neon in june of 1998.  It was a used 97 leased to a rental company before i bought it.  I bought my neon with 28,000 miles.  I wanted a good reliable car that was inexpensive and nice looking all at the same time.  I have had my neon for a year and a half now, and everything is slowly falling apart.  The brakes squeel and sometimes wont work.  When its raining sometimes i cant even turn my stearing wheel, some reason it just sticks so i have to stop right where i am at and then try turning it.  My transmission is going out.  The Dodge dealer Jim Doran forged my signiture of some insurance i bought to go with the car.  After i already signed the papers they changed the extra waranty to less years and less miles.  All the way around my neon and the Jim Doran dealership was horrible.  I will never buy a neon again...<br><br>
