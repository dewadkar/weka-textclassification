            I bought this car in 1995 when it was still new.
The first thing to go were the AC Vent shields, broke apart like a cheap wooden box. It handled like a bicycle on steroids. The interior was noisy, and as far a comfort....well what comfort? The check engine light came on, stayed on for about 10,000 miles, then mysteriously went out. The AC went bad, the car is seriously underpowered. I hated this car. I would not suggest buying this lemon to anyone.
I finally traded it in this year, for a new Ford Ranger, wow what a difference. <br><br>
