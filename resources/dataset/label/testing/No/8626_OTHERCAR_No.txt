            In 2001, the consumer reports ranked it the number one in its class, but please read this review before buying one.

<b>WHY I LIKED THE MINIVAN</b>
The new Odyssey is the largest Honda ever made.  The ride is very good, smooth V6.  It is currently the longest, widest and tallest minivan in its class.  It is got some nice feature for 2001 such as: traction control is now standard on the LX, as well as the EX, for added stability. And the EX adds a security system for its keyless entry feature.  From everything I saw on the internet, I was ready to buy the van.  But it fell short of my expectation when I visited the dealership.

<b>WHY I DO NOT RECOMMEND</b>
The exterior and interior worksmanships on the vehicle are not as neat and well crafted when compared to Toyota, which was my second choice.  The front styling is plain.  Front passenger feels close to dashboard. Seat support isn't good.  The gear selector is awkward. It's got soft brake pedal. Even with these defects, I still decided to buy this van due to its high ranking by consumer reports.  So I started talking to the dealer about price, because there was only a handful of minivans on the lot, the dealer was not very interested in negotiating, plus the dealer's price adds about $1500 markup on top of MSRP.  That is when I decided to look at some of the other minivans.  It wasn't worth it to pay such high price for a name.

<b>WHAT I BOUGHT INSTEAD</b>
So I visited the Toyota dealership next to the Honda.  The Sienna is ranked #2 by Consumer Reports.  I loved its design, both exterior and interior.  I picked a loaded XLE model and started talking to the dealer about price.  The dealership had about 30-40 minivans, so he was more than willing to negotiate.  I got the van for $25900, about the same price for a base model Odyssey.
