            OK, Does the title say enough?  Maybe not.  My wife and I were in the market for an SUV back in 1998.  She had bought a 1998 Honda Accord brand new.  We really like the car and I wanted to buy an SUV.  We headed off to the Honda dealership in Reno.  We found the same saleswoman and took the Passport for a test drive. 

I liked the style, size, and the comfort of the Passport.  It had great features like A/C, power windows and doors, keyless entry, and available leather and CD player.  I was pretty impressed!

So, I pulled off the side of the road to check out some of the smaller details.  I lifted up the hood and I noted that there was a sticker near the engine.  The sticker said <i>Isuzu Motor Corp.</i> I thought that was odd!

I asked the saleswoman about this and she said, "Isuzu makes the motor for us."  OK, sounds plausible, right?  I kept looking around the vehicle and I found the jack in the back of the truck.  It said <b>Isuzu</b> on it.  Now I was really suspicious.  Something wasn't right.

I really liked the truck and I've always been impressed with the Honda product.  My mom drove a late 1980s Accord for what seems like forever!

I talked with my wife (who wanted to buy right away) and convinced her to get back in the car.  We drove to the Isuzu dealership and she was shocked to see that the <b>Isuzu Rodeo</b> was the exact same vehicle we test-drove at the Honda dealership.  Only the stickers were different.  Oh, the price was also.  The <b>Rodeo</b> was much cheaper!

So I bought the Rodeo!  I've been driving it for almost 3 years now and I still love it.  I would recommend it for anyone, but I wouldn't buy a Passport because you can get the same truck with a different name for a better price.  Now <i>that's</i> a good way to save money!

I know this was a step away from my medical epinions, but hopefully it will help someone who considers buying this vehicle.
