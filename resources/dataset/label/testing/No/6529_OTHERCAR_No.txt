            I bought this vehicle under the incentive that I would recieve $500 off of the sticker price of this car.  The car seemed nice at first then little things started happening.  The car started shaking-I took it in almost five times before I finally gave up on the shaking.  I have had the door panels on both passenger and driver side at least four times.  The aluminum wheel covers have chipped and are discolored.  The clips on the dashboard fell out, so now the steering column is falling apart.  The dashboard above the radio has bubbled up and the glue no longer holds it together.  The carpet on the door panel decided to fall off.  The trunk now gets wet, and I don't know how.  I took excellent care of this car.  I have given and done everything I could to this car.  I have dropped so much money and time into this vehicle I probably could have bought two new ones by now.  I would not suggest buying this car, all it has is problems.<br><br>
