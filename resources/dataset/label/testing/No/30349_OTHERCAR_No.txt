            For a $60 camera marked down to $25, I thought this was a pretty good deal. Even at $25, I can't recommend this camera. The lighting has to be bright just to take a picture and the picture is of such poor quality, you wonder why they even call this a camera. I've seen abstract art with more 'realism' than the images from this camera. I even tried to 'dumb' down the photo by taking a picture of a yellow piece of paper and it came out off-white. When I called the store I bought it from, they reported that they get these cameras back on a regular basis.
