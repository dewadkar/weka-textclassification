             I'm not terribly impressed with this car. I have had it since November and have had it in the shop 4 times.
 
 I've had the stereo replaced once &amp; reset once.
 
 I wish I had test drove the car in the rain - if you want some fresh air while it's raining, be prepared to have what sometimes seems like a river flowing into the car on top of you!

 The fan is very noisy, I was told it was due to the engine being small but a turbo &amp; needing an oversized fan???
 
  I have had major problems with the fuel pump. It constantly makes a high pitched whining noise. My complaint was first noted as &quot;not being able to duplicate customers complaint&quot; - which was clearly a way to get me out of there. When I picked up the car, I asked that they tell me how they could not have heard such an obvious noise.
 That was when the technician 'remembered' that there was a problem w/ the fuel pump and that Volvo was 'aware of the problem and in the beginning stages of redesigning it &amp; a new one would be available anywhere from 3 months to 2 years'.
 On the 4th visit, I really wasn't happy. I was told that a call was placed to Volvo and that they again are aware the problem exists, but told the technicians not to replace it, but that if it became a problem they would take care of it. Needless to say, I was not happy I was given the run around by all the managers that were there that day saying there was nothing they could do except put me in there day planner &amp; update me every couple of months.
 I asked if all the S40's had this problem and was told by the Service manager that this was his 1st complaint, that he's never had this come up. But on the other hand the technician I was also dealing w/ told me that yes, this was becoming a concern - come on!
 I then requested that they replace the fuel pump and was told no, Volvo told them not to do that. Their stand on it was why take it all apart just to find out that the replacement was faulty also. And was informed by the manager that he fully understood their position. 
 Ok - then could they understand a customer that-every chance she got, was going to turn away business for them because Volvo obviously wasn't concerned w/ keeping customers happy? So what if a new one did the same thing, at least they were trying to make me, the one paying a good sum of money, happy.
 I got a call the next day from the manager asking me when I could bring my car in. They 'all of a sudden' had a 'new, REDESIGNED' fuel pump for me. The same one that I was told the day before wasn't even in the testing stages yet. Amazing!

 On the other hand, I do think the car is pretty comfortable, and I am happy with the way it handles. 
 
 It's sporty but also safe feeling. I would feel comfortable having kids in the car, not extremely afraid if there were to be an accident.

 Anyway, my opinion isn't too high of Volvo or the dealership I used. 
It looks like a lot of people have had good experiences,and I'm very happy no one had to deal w/ the trouble I have had and I hope others continue to have better experiences!

 Thanks for letting me vent!
