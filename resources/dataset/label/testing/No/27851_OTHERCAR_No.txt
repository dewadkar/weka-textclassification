               I bought a 1997 galant.  It was a brand new car.  Bought in march of 1997.  It was pretty good for the first year and a half.  No troubles with it.  Not that I was expecting any, cause it was a new car.  Then last summer, the thing started to have all kinds of problems.  
   
   First off, the interior, everything started to come apart.  Once, I had the windows down and a part of the car flew from the back to the front.  No joke.  My brother was getting into the car one day, and he was closing the door, and the handle broke off.  Now....to the exterior....the front mitsubishi sign fell off, half of the name in the back fell off.  
   
   Now this is just the minor stuff.  So if this is what happens to the minor stuff....imagine what is going on with the engine and the like.  Oh man.  Last summer, when the car was a year and a half...the brakes started to go really bad. I wasn't able to stop fast when i was on the highway.  So I got those fixed....and it's starting to do it again.  
   Then I have this really strange hissing or humming noise coming from under the hood.  I took it to the mechanic...but he has no clue what it is.  It's really annoying.  The car is almost 3 years old and it is worse then my friends 13 year old car.  It was a good car for the first year and a half..but it just went down hill from there.  <br><br>
