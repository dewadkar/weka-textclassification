            Men dream of hot rods.  Why not dream of one with leather, AC, and a cool stereo.  The Prowler is a great looking car and is a great buy if that is what you want it for.  The car is expensive if you are looking for a cool car to ride down the boulevard with.  At a glance you will think you have gone to heaven because I have definately never seen anything like it.  It also feels like no other. I felt the entrance was placed to high.  I am a tall man and I still had trouble pulling my legs in.  Judging by what I could see outside the windshield I hope I never have to park close to another car.  I definately had problems finding the hood. I had to strech my neck to find out where it began. Dealerships will not pay to much attention to you if you are looking at it unless you look like you have the bucks to test drive it.  The dealership I visited priced the Prowler at $42,000 and marked it up to $62,785.  That is way to expensive for looks.  The power is not all there, I am now thinking about a used 98' Prowler.  <br><br>
