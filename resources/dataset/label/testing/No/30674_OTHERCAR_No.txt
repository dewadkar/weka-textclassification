            This is my second Limited. I bought the car because even though my 1993 LTD had major problems Chrysler stood behind their product. 

My first 1993 LTD was replaced by Chrysler after 10 days because it had an electrical short, causing the car to shut off while moving. I would be driving at 50 to 60 mph and the car would shut off and jump start itself. The brand new replacement car had a bad transmission which was replaced within the first month. But thereafter, for the next 46 months and 50,000 miles, the car was worry free.  

So I leased a new 1997 LTD which now has 48,000 miles. My lease is up in January and I do not think I will be leasing a third LTD next year. First problem was with a starter which did not disengage and burned out. Next was the faulty gas gauge problem. I just received the front brake rotor recall which does me no good because I had to change the rotors last year at my own expense. 

Currently I am dealing with a major problem which Jeep is conducting damage control on, the same way they tried to hide the gas gauge problem and the front brake rotor problem. The problem is with the rear differential carrier bearings.  I know three people who have had this problem and a dealer has told me that they are doing a lot of repairs on it. 

The problem starts to appear around 25 to 30,000 miles as a low pulsating, scraping hiss out of the rear end. It gradually grows louder and louder. Mine appeared at 28,000 miles, but 2 years ago it was just dismissed as road noise. At 42,000 miles I brought it in thinking that my rear brakes were shot and I was told what the problem was.  It's a $1200 repair and Chrysler refuses to cover it because the car is out of warrantee even though I have proof that it has been in three times in the past two years for this problem. 

So if they won't stand behind their product I'm quite sure I can find a better place to spend my $37,000.
