            My lease on my Miata is up in a couple of months and I feel ready for a SUV. I love my Miata, so I thought the new Tribute would be the answer--wrong! I went for a test drive, and it was, by far, the worst test-drive experience I have had.

As soon as I sat down in the Tribute I knew it would not be a pleasant experience. The seats were so uncomfortable--like sitting plyboard. I went to start the engine, and I had a hard time finding the clutch with my foot. It was so close to the gas pedal...it was like trying to drive with my knees tied together. Now keep in mind that I do drive a Miata. For those not familiar with the size of the interior of a Miata, it is TINY. But I can shift comfortably in the Miata--not so in the Tribute. The actual stick shift was stiff and hard to put into first. Once I made it off of the lot, the real fun (that's sarcasm) began.

It was so noisy, and I never went faster than 40mph. Had I driven on the highway, I believe my ears would still be ringing today. Because the shifting was so stiff and awkward, the vehicle lurched every time I changed gears. I would be afraid to have anyone ride in the car with me for fear that they might have whiplash by the end of the ride.
The salesman asked me what I thought and I told him. He thought that I should test drive an automatic. I said that unless the automatic came with comfy seats, noiseless interior, and better overall construction of the interior (the locks rattled while I drove), then I wasn't interested. It's a real shame. It looks good from the outside. I guess it just goes to show...you can't judge a book by its cover (or a Tribute by its exterior design). I would not spend money on this car. If I won it, I would sell it. I love Mazdas, but they have a lot of work to do on this one.
