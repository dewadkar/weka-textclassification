                    <b>T</b>o succeed the very long running Beetle Cabriolet, Volkswagon and Karmann got together and duplicated the procedure and took the tiny VW Rabbit's body, removed the roof, and fitted a convertible cloth top to produce another long running VW cult car convertible known as the VW Cabrio.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

       <b>M</b>uch of the original GTI's great character and performance was carried over with the larger engined VW Cabriolet. It has the same (if not better) precise handling with very good cornering ability, with a similarly impressive ride, coupled with extremely good levels of road holding. All performance is somewhat easy to achieve through a well designed 5-speed manual transmission. Don't expect to win any races with this car, with 94 horsepower moving almost 2,400lbs, you are in the same power to weight ratio range of a Ford Escort. In-fact if you race a bare bones Pony escort for say 1989-1990 which weighs only around 2,180lbs and has 90 hp, you are most likely going to get your proverbial 'butt kicked'. Moving on, With the top down the car flexes and shakes a little, but not quite enough to spoil the crisp handling and 'Fun in the sun' enjoyment. 

        <b>E</b>arly Cabriolet's were powered by 1.5 liter or 1.6 liter engines, but from 1982 the 1.8 4-cylinder  was fitted. It is an iron block, alloy head, non crossflow design, with undersqaure dimensions with a smaller bore than stroke. It has a single belt driven overhead camshaft working only 2 valves per cylinder. keep in mind folks that this was a 21,000 dollar car, you would think VW could have at least made this car a 12 valver. With  relatively high compression ratio of 10.0:1 and electronic fuel injection, output for the 1.8 is 98 in Europe and  even more pathetic 94 horsepower for all of us in the USA.. Is it just me or did VW forget that it was 1993 and not 1963? Obviously with the price tag on the 1993 Cabriolet they didn't.

    <b>T</b>he standard Rabbit's bodyshell needed to be strengthened to withstand the loss of its roof. Reinforcing sections were therefore added to the side members and the floorpan. Closing off the rear hatchback section of the body also helped improve structual rigidity, as did the addition of a roll bar. The Cabriolet retained the front drive design with a transverse-mounted engine, Macpherson struts up front and torsion-beam rear axle.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 
     
 The <b>interior</b> of the Cabriolet is actually relatively refined (compared to the older models) and that is not saying much. Ergonomics are not the best, the shifter is kinda hard to reach, its tiny, and the dash is hard black and looks like something straight from 1982. The seats are supportive however, and this car also comes  with power steering and air conditioning. The 1993 VW Cabriolet also comes with a power top.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

    The <b>exterior</b> is very 'late 1970s-1980s' looking. The headlights look like they came out of a 1982 BMW, and the body looks like my friend's 1970's VW rabbit. Urethane bumpers and rocker extensions identify the later Cabriolet's. I know I have said a lot of negative things  about the 1993 Cabriolet, but heck, this was a 21,000 dollar car in 1993, not a 5,000 dollar car in 1973! One major positive note: the 1993 Cabriolet came with a rear glass window. 

<i>Pricing:</i>

    The  <b>price</b> for these cars have went down significantly since 1993, first being sold at $21,000, a used one can be found for around $6,000 or so, If you ask me, the price is still way too high, I don't care what  Kelly Blue Book tells me.  
    
 I can not comment on reliability of this car because I do not own one, but my neighbor/friend does, and it's always in the shop for repairs, in-fact she just spent almost 2,000 dollars on a new manual Transmission, Ouch.. I suggest you check a more reliable source to see if this is common, such as <b>Consumer Reports.Org</b>.
