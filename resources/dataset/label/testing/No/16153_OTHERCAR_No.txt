               I have owned my Dodge Avenger for 1 year.  I love the look
  of the car, sporty, and easy to handle.  The 
  back of the car is high up and he rear view 
  very limited.  This car was inexpensive for the price to 
  own a sports car.  On the average I have had the car back 
  to the dealership at least every other month to have something
  fixed, i.e. alternator, radiator cooling system etc.
  I decided, although cheap as a buy very high in maintaining,
  that is to keep it running.  I found out that, these cars
  depreciate very quickly, so I now owe more than it is worth.
  I do not recommend this car to anyone, unless you like the 
  coffee they serve at your local service shop, or just 
  hanging out with the mechanics.  My local service area
  calls me if they do not see me for a couple of months,
  wondering where I am at--just kidding.  I have never
  had such a bad experience mechanically with a car.
  This Christmas,  I bought my Dodge Avenger a new 
  alternator, and for a stocking stuffer I threw in a new
  battery.  <br><br>
