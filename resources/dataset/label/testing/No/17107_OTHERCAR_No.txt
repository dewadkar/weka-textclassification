            I had the opportunity to drive a 1999 Mercedes M-class &quot;SUV&quot; a while back. Of course, being a auto lover, I jumped at the opportunity. I was less than impressed. It did have sever positive points, though. It had a very comfortable interior with all the bells and whistles. It had a CD player, GPS system, and a sunroof, which were very nice features to have on our hour and a half trip. The engine had nice power which was more than enough to help me pass several logging truck along our route. I was surprised at the power that it possessed in an &quot;SUV&quot;. It did have many downfalls, though. It handled very poorly, rolling around corners and having a slight understeer. It also had lots of noise compared to other Mercedes I have ridden in. The styling was also a negative. Both me and the friend that was riding with me thought that it was very ugly. I thought it resembled a large roller skate, he thought it looked like a big marshmallow. This vehicle had to be one of the least attractive of any Mercedes I have ever seen. Some people might not think that, but that is their own opinion and they are entitled to it. However, for the money that these things cost, a perfectly good Mercedes sedan or coupe could be bought. I suggest that if you have the money to spend, spend it on a Mercedes car. 

THE GOOD - Nice power, very comfortable and friendly interior

THE BAD - Handling, complicated GPS system

THE UGLY - The M-class itself<br><br>
