            The title pretty much sums it up... the Sable is a decent car to have bought new, or perhaps with low miles. Buying one with over 100k miles is a real crapshoot.

I bought one for $3800 back in 1996, which had around 100k miles on it. The car was comfortable and handled well for a mid-size sedan. The engine was perhaps the best mechanical thing in the vehicle, and ran smooth & powerful until the day I sold the car. The transmission held up while I owned the car, but failed after I sold the car to a friend. There was no bad blood over the matter, since I sold the car for under trade-in value.

The A/C had to be fixed at some point, and I remember having to buy the only available hoses from a dealer, which cost around $450 for both hoses... they were some VERY expensive hoses. The A/C repair totaled over $750 (a lot of money to spend for cold air).

One time, I was commuting to work, and just had gotten off of I-95. I was stopped at a light, and when it turned green, naturally stepped on the gas. I got 1/2 way across the intersection, and the whole car shuddered. I apparently had no steering, and the car lurched to the right, while there was the sound of screeching tires. I got out, to see that both of the front wheels were pointing away from each other. The tie-rod end snapped, and if it had happened only 45 seconds earlier on I-95, I very likely would have been killed.

Over the years, believe it or not, I have seen Taurus and Sable Sedans and Station Wagons on the shoulders of roads with both front wheels pointing in different directions. I guessed I have witnessed about 5 or 6 of these instances both before mine failed as well as after. I queried my mechanic about the tie-rods, and he agreed that the design was "weak", and that they should be checked at least twice a year.

For this reason alone, I could not possibly recommend either the Taurus nor Sable model line from 1986 thru 1995. There is genuine reason to be concerned when one individual has seen for himself so many of the same model apparently afflicted with the same defect.

The friend I sold the car to was warned about having the steering regularly checked. She had few options and I was the one most willing to work with her to get her back on the road after her car had died. I would not, however, recommend this model for a buyer who does not know for certain the car's maintenance, and for safety's sake condemn purchasing this model to air on the side of caution.

Note: I also owned a 1996 Taurus Sedan while I owned the Sable. It had front suspension problems as well, until I had the suspension rebuilt.

Although I think this model is the wrong choice, I'll go into some other features, due to popular demand.

Interior:
Ample legroom in front and reasonable legroom in rear. Seats are velour and comfy. Rear seat has a pull-down armrest. Headrest supports are relatively useless for anything other than keeping the headrests from falling off i.e: if you are tall, you will get whiplash because the headrest won't lock in place. Environmental controls are somewhat within reach and fairly well designed, and stereo is typically placed. Full analog instrumentation is included. Odometer is the cable-kind and therefore may have been rolled back before you buy one. The ride is quiet as long as a tie-rod dosen't break and the car shudders while at least one tire screeches and/or blows out... but at that point the cabin insulation won't be a priority, anyway. The trunk is fairly good in size, but was kind of shallow for some items (like 2 strollers or 1 bike). The AM/FM cassette stereo sounded pretty good.

Exterior:
Body is made of steel and is looking for an excuse to rust, although dents seem to be less severe than on more recent (post-'96) models, which must have been made with thinner stock. Plastic bumpers are okay, I guess... but a slow collision could break the mounts at the fenders, resulting in an ugly, flapping mess going down the highway. Paint is definitely sub-par for any vehicle, no matter how cheaply made (mine was repainted before I bought it, thank god). Hood, trunk lid and doors opened and closed normally.

Electrical:
Acessories were less than trustworthy, especially A/C. Mine was equipped with a load-sensing system that redistributed braking force when there was weight in the trunk and/or rear seat, which didn't seem to make much of a difference on the road, but did once at my mechanic's shop. The alternator went once, but I don't hold that against the make or model... It's a tough job being an alternator.

Mechanical:
Aside from the aforementioned, The power steering hoses are poorly designed, and take a very long track to go from the pump to the rack. My mechanic custom fashioned one instead of buying a factory hose, which was more reliable. The hose fitting at the pump is VERY unreliable. The cooling system worked okay, however the electric fan had to be replaced once. The oil and transmission pans are not great in design, and seeps or leaks are fairly common at higher miles. Transmissions are not award-winning, either... but I lucked out with mine. The engine was the best thing in the car. Off the line, the car was like a silver bullet, which partly endeared me into buying it. The brakes were fair, but the rear brake cylinders had to be replaced a couple times.

Mileage was fair at best, being somewhere between 15 and 24 MPG depending on conditions. Traction and cornering were pretty good. Snow traction is good for a sedan.
