            buyers of used neon's dodge or plymouth with the 2.0L eng's need to beware
the have a head gasket problem, if the newest style gasket from chrysler has been put on your ok. but the old style gaskets leak badly from the left rear corner, and if not taken care of can cause the head to wrap and or dissovle causing the head to be replaced, on the 95-96 model years the aluminum heads had some bad aluminum in them and the will start to come apart around the coolent holes and will finally cause a total head failure which can cost close to $600-$800 to repair. so if you thinking about buying one of these cars, check under it to see any oil leaks are showing, if so have it fixed by someone using chrysler replacement gaskets or don't buy it. <br><br>
