            My wife and I were looking for a powerful, reliable, quiet vehicle with all the options.  What we found was the 2001 Dodge Stratus RT - powerful as a gorilla and apparently built by them, too.
We absolutely loved the vehicle and were willing to overlook the fact that the CD changer went out after about 1 month and Dodge had simply forgotten to weld on the critical bracket that attaches the rear seat to the frame. . . At least until the fire.  We got in the vehicle one night, turned on the key and woof.  Out puffs about 2 cubic yards of whitish-grey smoke.  This was accompanied by the service engine soon light and a strong electrical burning smell.  We turned off the car, opened the hood, and found the battery boiled over with acid wetting the top of it.  We got it towed to the dealer. Dodge looked at it, inspected it, turned off the Service Engine Soon light, replaced the battery hold-down brackets (which were mangled by the acid), and told us it was normal battery corrosion (car was under 1 year old).  They had no explanation for the fire and told us there was no fire.  They had no explanation for the Service Engine Soon light or the fact that they all occurred together.
We were uncertain whether to file it as a lemon. . . until the horn went kablooey.  5 Days after getting the car back from the dealer, the horn went on solid and stayed on until it melted itself out (over 30 minutes).  The car had not been started all day.  We again towed it to Dodge, who replaced the horn, the relay, and the horn button on the airbag.  They again had no idea why it happened.
We are currently filing under the Florida Lemon Law.  The State's Attorney General says we have a strong case - Daimler-Chrysler's lawyer has repeatedly tried to convince us otherwise.
