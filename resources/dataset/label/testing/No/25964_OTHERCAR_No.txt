            First of all, let me say I did not buy this vehicle, but we rented a Chevrolet Cavalier for six weeks after a car accident and it was a terrible experience. This may not hold true for all Cavaliers but I thought I would share my experience, as these cars seem to be VERY cheaply made.

The first one we got was a 1999 and had only 21,000 miles on it, but the alignment was pulling to the right very badly, the brakes were stiff and hard to depress  and the wiper blades screeched miserably. I would have chalked this up to poor maintenance by the rental company if not for the fact that the switch for the turn signals was so cheap and poorly made that it broke off when testing the lights before we left our house. Most models of automobile I have ever driven have a metal bar inside these switches to prevent this from happening, but not the Cavalier. We had to drive all the way back to the rental agency with no turn signals to get another car. They gave us another Cavalier.

Having tried to believe that the problems we had with the other one was due to the fact that the car was a year old and was possibly poorly maintained by the rental agency, we hoped for a better experience, but this one was just as bad. The new car was a brand new 2000 Cavalier and had 1500 miles on it. In fact, the agency said those were test miles and the car had never been rented to anyone.

We had trouble from the beginning. First of all the air conditioner vents were very loose and would not stay closed or stay in the position they were put in, the glove compartment rattled constantly, the steering wheel was loose and jittered when driving and the passenger side visor kept falling down on its own.

Overall my impression of the Chevy Cavalier is that it is poorly made and not reliable, although I do have a few good things to say about it. The seats were comfortable, though the interior was a little snug, but that is to be expected with a compact car. The sound system was very good, almost as good as some professionally installed custom systems I've heard. The overall handling of the second car we rented was good, and the ride was rather smooth with very few bumps or jitters.

The low purchase price makes it a sensible car for a college student or a single person, but I would definitely not recommend it for anyone with children, as it is too poorly made overall to withstand the wear and tear on the parts, especially the plastic parts.<br><br>
