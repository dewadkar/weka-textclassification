            "I was country when country wasn't cool."
I also owned this truck before the they coined the term "SUV". When I bought this truck used in 90, it already had 44K miles. I've owned it for 13 years now. The odometer is up to 118K. I'll have to say its been a reliable vehicle for me but the cost of keeping it up was not cheap. I seemed like something was always going wrong with my Jimmy. Like clockwork, every six months, I'd be in to visit my mechanic with this complaint or that ailment. About the only thing that's still original to my 88 S-15 GMC Jimmy is the body, transmission and engine block. Just about everything has been replaced at one time or another.
When I bought it in 1990, the 4.3 liter V6 engine revved with power. Now it putters, sputters, and stalls. Its always had a truck-like ride to it, but lately, like the ol' lady she is, she rattles and knocks at very turn or dip in the road. Her get up and go has got up and went!
Lately the ol' lady has developed a drinking problem too
I've watched her average MPG decline from a respectable 20 MPG to around 15 MPG (with sails unfurled and favorable winds). She used to consume a quart of oil every 3000 miles or so, now her drinking habit is put one quart every 500 miles or so.
To add tradegy to drugery, lately the headliner has drooped, the light switch has broken free of its mount, the domelights won't extenquish, and temp gage is dead as a doornail. 
You'd think I have the common decentcy to put her out of her misery (and mine) but like a cold collored mule, she just won't give up. She still starts in sub-zero temperatures, lumbers up steep, snowy hills while pulling a load, and goes handles rocky offroad terrain with respectable tenacity if not grace and style.
Like an old married couple, I'll put up with her tempermental antics for a few more years or as many miles as God see fit to grace her with but I have to admit that those slick young Trailblazers down at Chevy stables are beginning to look mighty fine to me.
