            I rented this car during a recent trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas so I had a chance to log on heavy mileage and experience both city and highway driving. For starters, we're talking about the GLS 4 door version, all other models/trim level I have no comment on.

EXTERIOR: Very Good
Stylishly designed car, attractive and pleasing to the eye. Paint job appears to be above average and production tolerance is more than acceptable.

ERGONOMICS: Okay
Even with power driver's seat, i found it difficult to find a perfect driving position for me (I'm a short guy). But that maybe me because its totally subjective.
Instrument panels were clear and legible.
Radio and fan controls I thought were awkwardly placed. The vent/recirculate buttons were placed in unusually low position and so was the airconditioning button. Worse yet, the buttons utilize a LED on the buttons themselves to indicate ON, which was very difficult to see in a bright sunny conditions.

POWER-TRAIN: Average
Loaded with a 3.4L engine, it unfortunately only produces 170 ponies. I thought it should muster out more than that. But the 0-60 acceleration is adequate at 8second range according to most automotive publications. 

ROOM: Good
There are plenty of front seating room, this is nothing to brag about. But the rear seating room is pretty good. You can cram 3 adults in the back but one of them better be a midget. And all that is expected since interior room has a direct relationship with exterior size. You don't go out there and buy a Metro and start complaining you can't fit 5 linebackers. There are also ample truck space.

VERDICT: Though reasonably priced at $21,545 (MSRP), I don't know if I would buy the V6 version when the 4 cylinder one produces 150 HP, just 20 shy of the GLS. $2600 difference exists between the 2 trim levels, if I were you, I take a hard long look at the two.<br><br>
