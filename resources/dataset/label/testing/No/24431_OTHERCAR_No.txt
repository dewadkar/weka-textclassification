            This is a great quality camera, but let's cut to the chase....

I bought it and played with it for a few days. I exercised every feature and immediately found the two kiss-of-death flaws. 

A) No optical view finder - forget about taking shots in dim light or bright sunlight. You simply can't see what you're taking and you have to guess. 

B) S L O W shutter release. Though I'm finding this trait with just about every digital camera I've tried, so I'd love to find a camera that you really can just snap at the right moment. Too many times I missed the moment and lost a photo opportunity. 

Apart from those two flaws, the camera takes great photographs if you have a steady hand, including some amazing shots at night, and I love the slide shot feature out to TV. 

However, the lack of a view finder makes this camera unusable - and the LCD screen is not protected by glass so gets dirty quickly and is extremely difficult to clean. Other camera don't have this problem since the screens are protected by glass.
