            I purchased a new Toyota RAV4 "L" model in February of 2001 and to date have 1,907 miles on the odometer. I bought this vehicle because I previously owned a 1997 RAV4 which was trouble-free. This vehicle is an improvement over the earlier model and being 6 feet 2 inches tall and 230 pounds, I appreciate the noticable extra interior width and the stylish new body however, this vehicle has a MAJOR design flaw which I hope will be fixed in all future models for the public's sake. 

With 1100 miles on the odometer, I drove this vehicle from Mesa, AZ to Las Vegas NV, a 300 mile trip. Upon returning home and an hour into my trip, the air conditioner started blowing first warm, then hot air and the rest of the trip back home was miserable given it was June 1st and the average temperature was 104 and I still had another 4 hours to reach home. The following Monday the vehicle was taken to the dealer from which it was purchased (Tempe Toyota, located in Tempe AZ). After having the vehicle for 8 hours and 15 minutes, I received a phone call from one of the dealer's mechanics to inform me that it was not a manufacturer's defect with the air conditioning unit but rather a rock had penetrated the lower portion of the grill, punctured the air conditioner condenser, and I would need to have the condenser and "O" rings replaced at a cost of slightly over $800.00 plus applicable taxes. Consumers thinking about buying a used 2001 Toyota RAV4 should beware as there is a major grill design flaw wih this vehicle and this type of event is NOT covered by the vehicle's warranty. I was told by the dealer's mechanic to file a claim with my insurance company and this entire matter may well wind up being litigated in civil court, especially given the large air holes provided in the lower front bumper of this vehicle. My opinion is that Toyota should take responsibility for this type of incident as it obviously is a major design flaw which could have been averted by smaller air intake holes in the grill and/or adding a mesh protector just behind the grill, given the extra large intake holes. My other three vehicles, including another Toyota model (a 1997 Paseo Convertible), were all engineered to protect the air-conditioner condenser as they all have a mesh/honeycomb grill insert to deflect rocks and road debris, but the 2001 Toyota RAV4 does not. This is the first Toyota product I've ever had any problem with and if/when its repaired, I plan to get rid of it because I will not take the chance on this ever happening again as I don't have $800.00 to throw away each and every time I take a short trip in a vehicle to spend for something I feel the manufacturer could have spent $2.00 to engineer into the car. I'm very disappointed with this particular Toyota product, the dealership, and Toyota's response to this matter!  By posting this matter here on Epinions, I truly hope that the public will be informed and made aware of this design defect.
