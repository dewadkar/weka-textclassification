            Let's see, where to start.

My wife had to have this car.  "Honey it's sooooo cute."  I was against getting it, but it was the only car that she test drove that she liked.  I realize, only too late, that this was a mistake.

We paid 10K for it in 1997/1998 and it had 15K on the odometer.  The body and paint were o.k. and it didn't seem like too bad a car.  

At 65000 miles, the timing belt broke and we had to install a new engine.  Of course, a new engine ran around $2300 and so we had to settle for a used engine.  The used engine runs much better than the original engine, but it is much noisier.  Her car sounds like a Panzer Tank when she pulls it into the carport.  This is not because of an exhaust leak, it is just very noisy.

The paint has begun to flake off on both sides of the car's door moulding.  The rest of the paint looks terrible.  This, considering the vehicle has been parked in a carport all the time, makes me wonder where Hyundai bought their paint and the skill with which it was applied.  

At 75000 miles, the a.c. stopped working.  According to the shop, the a.c. evaporator is shot and must be replaced.  500.00 to start with to repair it.  This on a vehicle that blue books at 1200.  I don't think so.

The interior is very cheesy.  The dash and console are made of thin plastic that cracks easily.  Not that ramming my fist into it several times helped the situation, I must admit.  The seat covers feel like they were woven from rope and are very abrasive.  Keep this in mind when riding in shorts-Ouch.

I had to replace the exhaust system from the engine back since it rusted out.  Of course, the aftermarket system didn't fit like it should and now it rattles and bangs as it hits the frame.  Nice.

The clutch is soft and the transmission won't go into reverse unless you creep the car a bit forward first.

This car drives terribly on snow and ice, even with studded tires.  My wife and I were on the way to the hospital to have our first baby when I found this out.  Like I wasn't a nervous wreck to start with.  

It won't drive up on ramps to let me change the oil, because it rides so low, so I have to use a floor jack.  

The trunk space is decent, but I'm afraid to haul much back there since the body dents so easily.

The factory stereo is a joke.  My wife had it replaced with a cd player, but the radio installer almost had a nervous breakdown trying to figure out the wiring schematic.  

In short, I hate this car.
