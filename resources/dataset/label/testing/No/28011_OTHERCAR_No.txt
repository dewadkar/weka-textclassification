            <b>History</b>
I'll be honest.

I purchased a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am in April of 1998, and it was a total impulse buy.  The vehicle had literally just hit the streets, and I had been looking for an excuse to dump my unreliable 1996 Plymouth Neon.  Pontiac handed me that excuse in the form of the sexy new design on the '99 Grand Am.  I <i>had</i> been considering stodgy alternatives like the Honda Accord in the time leading up to the purchase, but decided I wanted fun over practicality (I was 24 at the time of purchase).  Ha!

To make a long story short, I picked out a black SE2 model with the 3.0 L V-6, 17" wheels, CD player, A/C and Automatic.  It was an absolute beauty, and I hadn't even seen one on the road yet.  I drove it, and the feeling of power compared to my tiny Neon made up my mind.  I drove the Grand Am off the dealer lot about 3 hours later, and left the dealer to figure what to do with the Neon from hell.  I paid $20,000 straight up for a car with a sticker of $19,800, and the dealer took $2,000 in negative equity in the Neon off my hands.

Upon delivery, there were a couple small quality issues.  A plastic piece on the A-frame (that holds up the roof) was warped and needed to be replaced.  There was another similar problem (I can't recall the exact nature of it), but the dealer took care of them both, no hassles.

<b>Performance</b>
The acceleration in the vehicle was very pleasing, but as I mentioned, I was coming from a 4 cylinder Neon.  I currently drive a 2001 Nissan Maxima, and the difference in acceleration from the Maxima to the Grand Am is almost as wide as the gap between the Grand Am and the Neon.  I'd grade the Grand Am as above-average for the class/price at the time.  Certainly strong enough highway passing power.
The ride seemed a little soft, but still good for what I wanted.  The braking was always a little weak - the '99 Grand Am is not a particularly small car (despite being a "compact").  This point was well-proven to me in October of 1999, when I got in my first (and only) car accident thanks to not having a lot of faith in my brakes.

Short aside about the accident.  I was in the process of moving from apartment to apartment.  The trunk was full, and the backseat was full of my things, plus a pet carrier for my two cats.  The car was handling a little differently, so I felt I needed to give it more room to brake properly.  I was going 45 mph (in a 40 zone), and saw a yellow - I knew I was well within my safe braking distance, so even though I hesitated, not wanting to run it, I decided to go anyways.  I hadn't put my foot on the brake yet, so I decided to coast through.  A teenager going the opposite direction was in the left turn lane, turned right in front of me, and I hit him in the door.  I had no chance to stop as heavily as the car was loaded.  I still feel that if the brakes were a little better that the accident could have been more minor - I probably hit his passenger door at about 15 mph, and did some decent damage.  Fortunately, nobody was seriously hurt other than the two cars (ironically, he was also driving a Grand Am, but a 1986 model).

The Grand Am's front end was pretty well rebuilt after that, and looked like new.  I never really trusted the brakes after that, though, and I'm certainly a much more cautious driver to this day because of that incident.

<b>Exterior Styling</b>
Sexy.  Everyone's seen them by now.  The first look at one really grabs you.  Unfortunately, I think the look has aged a little bit - not quite the same effect on me as before, but still a good looking car.  The plasticky exterior has always been a minor pet-peeve of mine.

<b>Interior Styling</b>
My favorite part of the vehicle, actually.  The air vents are circular, and spin in any direction.  Gives the dashboard sort of a cockpit feel, which goes well with the rocket-type look of the vehicle itself.  The background lights are orange on the dash and radio, which add to the sportiness factor.  My seats were cloth, and relatively comfortable.  There was an adjustable lumbar support for the lower back, but I didn't find it to be much help.  The trunk was a very good size for the class, and had a large opening (for easy loading).

There was a fair amount of squeaking and rattling once the car got past about two years old.

<b>Problems</b>
Brakes seemed a little weak, even in the first 10,000 miles (even with ABS).
Several small initial quality issues with plastic parts.
Water pump died around 50,000 miles, and required a tow.  There may have been other problems I can't recall, but I <b>do</b> recall the $1000 bill.
Overall reliability just didn't seem to be a strong point.

<b>Overall</b>
At the time, the V6 Grand Am SE2 seemed like a good deal.  Then the Grand Am GT came out six months later, and the SE2 didn't seem as sharp.  Now, considering you can get a fully loaded 2002 Altima for only $2k more than a fully loaded Grand Am GT, I couldn't see the point in buying one.  I put 60,000 miles on the Grand Am, and then traded it in for a 2001 Nissan Maxima SE.
