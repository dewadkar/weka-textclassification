            I recently purchased a 2000 Chevy Cavalier.  After 1200 miles, the service light came on, there was a clicking noise, and the daytime running lights went out.  I took the car into the dealership and picked it up the next day.  They told me the problem was a fuse and that it was all fixed.  On the way home I noticed that they put 20 miles on the car.  I realize they have to test it out, but 20 miles is ridiculous.  

After a few more days, the service light came on again.  When I brought it in this time they said it might be an electrical problem.  3 days later I got my car back.  They could not find a problem with the electric, yet it blew 3 fuses while it was in the shop.  All they did to repair the vehicle was continue to put in fuses.  Also, they managed to put 100 miles on the car - and I thought the first 20 was nuts!  The repair sheet stated that they worked on the car for 1 hour.  If you do the math, that is 100 miles per hour.  

Granted, much of this problem has been with the dealer, but the car still should be able to function after owning it for about a month and a half and only putting on 1200 miles.  I've had the car back for a week now and no new problems yet - but we shall see!<br><br>
