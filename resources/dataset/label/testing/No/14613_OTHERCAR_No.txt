            I have to wonder exactly what Mitsubishi was thinking when they designed this car. Maybe it would work well for a family with a few small children, but I'm not even so sure of that.

Next I have to wonder why I bought one. This car looks a lot nicer on the dealer's lot than it really is. It almost looks like an SUV, but it works more like a crowded station wagon. It isn't very comfortable no matter where you sit. It is almost useless for hauling anything, including luggage. An attempt at an extra rear-facing seat for small children eats precious cargo space, even with the seat folded down. With the seat folded down the &quot;floor&quot; of the cargo area is slanted and raised.

By the time any car is 8 years old it's not completely fair to assess how well it runs without knowing who owned it or how it was driven for most of that time. This car doesn't run that great. It burns a little oil, the brakes seem to require a lot more maintenance than they should, it makes some odd noises from time to time, and parts are not always readily available when needed.

Paint chips easily from plastic door handles. Otherwise the body seems to hold up pretty well.

Gas mileage is good, ranging mostly in the 25-30 miles per gallon range depending on the mix of city and highway driving.

Some of the controls are positioned inconveniently and function awkwardly. For example, the power lock button must be pressed up to make the locks go down, and vice versa. After driving this car for over a year I still push the power lock button the wrong way several times a week.

I wouldn't buy this car at any price if I had it to do over again, unless I could turn around and sell it immediately for a profit. I've had this one for a year, and I'm anxious to sell it.
