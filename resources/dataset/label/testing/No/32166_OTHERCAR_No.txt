            I don't think I need to translate POS...  This is an out-of-date design that gets a minor facelift every-so-often, and for the same price as this 1999 left-over, I could have an entry-level Taurus.  The only reason I have this bucket-of-bolts is because it's a company car.  I had a Pontiac Grand Am before, and obviously I wasn't too happy to get &quot;downgraded.&quot;  I'm a big guy, and could use more room, especially considering that I have to drive frequently on trips greater than 500 miles as part of my job. For me, interior space is a big issue, and that, combined with the fact that this design is &quot;long in the tooth,&quot; make this car is a poor value.

The worst thing about this car is the ride, which is jittery and fatiguing.  It feels as though this car has no shocks.  A friend of mine (sitting in the rear seat) hit his head on the ceiling when we went over a speed-bump!  I have the 4 speed automatic 2.4 liter, 150 horsepower engine.  The engine performs decently, but is raucous when revved.  The front seats feel comfortable at first, but are fatiguing on long trips.  The trunk has 14 cu ft of capacity.  The design of the controls is logical, and the climate control works reasonably well.  The car gets around 25-27 mph in mixed driving, and uses regular fuel.

This car had one significant reliability issue, with a problem shifting between the 3rd and 4th gear.  I can't quite remember what the cause of the problem was. However, it caused some scary moments when passing on two lane roads.  Otherwise, I've only experienced rattles, which are very pronounced when going over speedbumps.  Also, the turn-signals occasionally blink too rapidly, although that's not a major issue.

Safety-wise, the car lacks safety belt pretensioners, and the rear seat only has lap belts. Obviously there are dual air-bags, and ABS is standard.

If you are considering a GM compact car, I recommend the Prizm (cousin to the Corolla).  I'm due to get a Corolla soon, which will be a welcome change!
