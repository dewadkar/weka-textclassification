            I have a 1997 Trooper and while this SUV has everything in it like Leather seats, moon roof, power everything. CD payer, phone, heated seats, windshield wipers on head lights (that i still haven't figured out what they are for), power side view mirrors. EVERYthing but the kitchen sink. Although it has all these wonderful features and they would be great if I felt safe in this truck while I was turning a corner or driving on a part of the freeway where the winds are high! 

When I am in this SUV and it feels like we are lifting off the ground just because a tractor trailor passes us I just want to run to the Auto dealer and trade it in! Or when I am coming off of  or onto an exit and it feels like the whole truck is going to flip over.  Very soon I will be trading this truck in and when I do it will be no more SUV's for me unless it is a Surburban. Only because Surburbans are to heavy to do this and are made WELL.
