            I purchased king-cab new in 1996 mainly because I had a good friend that was a dealer.  I still have the truck and it currently has 123,000 miles and has been relatively problem free.  The bad thing is, this truck came with what I consider problems.  The ride and noise (especially engine noise in the cab) are terrible.  I know this is a truck, but there are other trucks out there that are much better in these categories eg. Toyota Tacoma and others.  The best I have been able to squeeze out of this truck is 16-18 mpg. which for a four cylinder is bad.  The steroo system sounds very "tinny" and the seats in the back of the king-cab are very, very cramped.  I now drive the truck back and forth to work and if that is all you want one for it will suffice.  Also, the truck sits too low to the ground, a truck should have more ground clearance.  I also noticed the truck leaked the first time I washed it at a high pressure car wash.
