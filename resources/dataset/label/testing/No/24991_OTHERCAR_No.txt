            On a recent trip through the mountains, mostly interstate, we rented a 2000 Chevy Lumina. I loaded up the family and filled a quite roomy trunk with baggage for a four day excursion in quest of relaxation.  

The first glitch I noticed was the lack of power going up steep grades, the next was hesitation or lack of smoothness with the cruise control, as we drifted through a few tight curves.  I was quite disappointed, with two of the most important features lacking and we hadn't even reached the Continental Divide.  The only other thing that bugged me was the fact I kept slamming my knee into the large waste of space where the door opens just trying to get my feet in the damn car, once in I was pretty comfortable.  

All in all we had a great time, put a lot of miles on the car and except for the above mentioned, the car performed well.  Whatever happened to heavy cars that used to pull their weight with some beef under the hood.  I told my wife there was a hamster in a cylinder  trying desperately to get to food that he would never reach, that is why we are going so damn slow.  

Oh well, what good would it be if you didn't have something to wine about amongst all the fun you have when you take a short break from reality. Actually, we drank quite a bit of wine so maybe that was the problem.<br><br>
