            Nice concept vehicle, but that's all.  The Xterra has an unmatched rugged look and lots of cool gadgets for the &quot;Xtremers&quot; out there, but the complete package is lacking.  Maybe I'm showing signs of age and at 24 years old I expect a little too much for $20,000 (Which is the best price on the market, but still too much).  

My qualms are with the interior, the power, and the handling: 

- 90% of the SUV market doesn't off road.  They are suburbanites that cruise around town trying to look like they just popped out of an A&amp;F catalog. The rugged looks are great but the plastic dash, hard seats, boring control console, and lack of rear head room due to &quot;stadium seating&quot; are not going to impress anyone.  Image conscious, you'll look cool driving it but don't let anyone in.  

- 170 horses don't go real far with this size car.  For true off-roaders, you don't care about the interior so the weak engine is your only major concern and it is a major problem.  You should look elsewhere.  

- The extra height (created by the stadium seating) looks great but weakens cornering ability and the suspension rides like a cheap pickup truck. 

If you like Nissan Cars, which I do very much, opt for a used Pathfinder.  You'll get more power, soft comfortable seats, tighter handling, and I got $4,000 extra dollars in my pocket.  My vote -- Thumbs down. <br><br>
