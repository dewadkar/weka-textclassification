            I'll say right now that I know nothing about the performance of this car, I have never actually driven one.  The closest I have ever come was riding in one for 15 minutes on the way to a movie. I don't think that should be much of a problem though, because if you are purchasing this car you are probably not too concerned with things like accelleration, handling, or gas mileage.  What I intend this review to be is a warning to any who might be considering this car, a list of what us mere mortals think of the Escalade and the people who drive them.  And by the way, I live in Detroit so I consider myself an automotive expert.

<b>Cadillac does not make SUV's</b> it makes big boat like cars for old people and pimps.  So in this case you have a double style offense.  Once you put a Cadillac logo on the front of the car it stops being a burly truck and becomes a <i>way</i> too big caddie.

<b>way too small on the inside</b> I have no ideal how it happens but from the outside the car could easily be mistaken for a small three bedroom ranch, but as soon as you get inside it it becomes a ford Escort.  I swear the car must have doors that are three feet thick.  Seriously though, I stand at about 5'10&quot; and in the back seat I felt like my knees were hitting my chest,  and my head was way too close to the roof.  If it is supposed to be a <i>luxury</i> SUV it should be comfortable.

<b>UGLY</b> I'll let you in on a little secret, excessive moulding makes cars very very ugly.  The Escalade reminds me of those macaroni craft things you did in pre school. Where you take something that previously would have been mildly attractive and then progressively make it ulgier with each noodle you apply.

<b>What people will think of you</b>  They won't think that you ever take it off road, because in that case you would have a Yukon.  They won't think that you care about the way the car performs, because, if it isn't going off road, this is a slow, sluggish car.  Nor will they think that you have any taste, because the Yukon is considerably more attractive.  They probably won't think that you are all that bright either, because given the price of Gas and the fact that we are going to run out of it in 40 or 50 years, you went out and purchased a glorified minivan that gets 10 miles to the gallon*.  They will think you are an incredibly shallow, image driven person, because you sacrificed practicality, comfort, performance, style, and I will argue, your dignity, for a Cadillac logo.

*some simple math for you, if you purchased a car tha got 20 mpg you would use half the gas, paying half as much on gas per year.<br><br>
