            Nice car when it works, but it sure spends a lot of time at the dealership.  It has the worst service and the most incompetent mechanics on the planet.  (They put a piece of rug under the engine to cut vibrations..., they claim that the car has been fixed when it is in worst shape than before, my garage floor is black from spilled liquid, etc., etc.)

The top brass is not accessible.  I have tried in vain to communicate with anyone with any authority.

I will not recommend this car to my worst enemy!

We bought it new, keep it in the garage and in general treat it well, very well. 

I have no confidence in the car, and I found out that many are having the same delightful experience with the both Land Rover and Range Rover.

Do not buy it new and especially used.<br><br>
