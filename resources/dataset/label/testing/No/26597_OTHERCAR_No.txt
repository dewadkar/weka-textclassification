            In 1996 I purchased a Chrysler New Yorker. The car is a black four-door sedan fully loaded. For the first two years this car was everything that I wanted.  Now I regret buying this car because the next year they changed the name of the New Yorker to the LHS giving it a little upgrade.  It also started breaking first the engine had to be replaced which I didnt pay for because it was under warrantee, then all the little things started to break (like the lights on the dashboard). All I have to say is that this car is good for at most three years. All I have had with this is problems. I am glad that I am selling it and getting a new car, which hopefully is better.<br><br>
