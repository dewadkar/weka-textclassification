            I was a photo major in college so one would think I could get a good photograph with any camera. But this camera defies those assumptions. I can't get a decent photo out of this thing. I mean I can't even see what I took o photo of. Sometime the flash works sometimes it doesn't. AND EAT THRU BATTERIES MY GOD !

The camera does not take close ups. The camera has terrible resolution. Even photos which are not enlarged are pixilized. there is a lot to be said for the metering system. The images are very contrasty and it makes it difficult to view your image.

I won this camera thru a website and I'm going to throw it away. If I paid for it I would be irate. Good thing I got it for free<br><br>
