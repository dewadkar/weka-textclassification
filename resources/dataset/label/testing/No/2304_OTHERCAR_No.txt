            I bought this vehicle because I owned a 1996 and loved it.  I had great success with the 96 until I was hit my another driver.  The dealership made me a great deal on my 1999 Kia Sofia LS.

I love the way it handles on the road.  For such a little car it gives the feel of power on the road.  Though it is a small car it handles like a pro.  The features are also a great plus.  There is plenty of options to help make a driver comfortable from tilt steering to the seat adjustments in height, length and reclining positions.  

I hate the many electrical problems I've had with this vehicle.  The car currently has 15K miles on it and is on it's third battery.  It has had the alternator changes as well in a year's time.  The vehicle shocked me when I touched it, stalled and died due to these electrical problems.  I am still having issues and am considering returning it under the &quot;Lemon Law&quot;.

I know from the dealership the wiring diagram is a full book due to the odd and end pieces KIA used to put the car together.  I believe I will end up replacing the wiring harness and all wiring.

I would not recommend this car to a family that does not have a second vehicle.  The dealership does not have a loaner policy for this make.
