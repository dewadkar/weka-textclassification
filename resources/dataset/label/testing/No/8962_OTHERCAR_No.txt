            When I first stepped into my 1999 Plymouth Breeze Expresso model, I fell instantly in love!  Comfy seats, enough leg room for a 6'2&quot; person, knobs and buttons within arms length, and most impressive, the 6 speaker CD player.  Within 3 months of purchasing this vehicle, I understood why it had such a lovely discount and also realized that &quot;love at first sight&quot; is easily forgotten.  
I have not put many miles on this car in the past year and a half.  How could I, it is almost always in the shop!  The mileage is terrible for a 2.0 engine and despite the great new tires it came with, it rides like an old wooden rollercoaster.  I have never been so let down by a vehicle in my entire life!  The windshield spray nozzles have had to be replaced twice, the rear driver window motor went out within 5 months of purchase, it rattles worse than my old beat-up Chevy I drove in high school(a car that was nearly as old as me at the time!), it has absolutely no get-up-and-go, and the &quot;wonderful&quot; speaker system cracks and pops and couldn't handle a good bass line to save its life.  
I am a patient person, most of my patience however is waiting to see what the next thing to go out is going to be.  Mostly I am waiting until I get fed-up enough with it to park it on the lot I purchased it from and tell them what I think of it.<br><br>
