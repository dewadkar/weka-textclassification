            A few years ago my parents bought me a 2700 Vivitar Digital Camera. I was thrilled to recieve it. I did my best to take care of it. But soon the battery door wouldn't close right to make contact with the batteries.  My dad glued the metal battery part back onto the door for me.  The camera worked for another few months. I had to use rechargable batteries in it cause it eat so many regular batteries that I couldn't keep affording to use regular batteries.  Over time the camera just stopped working. My dad couldn't determine the problem.  

My dad bought a 2750 Vivitar Camera so we decided to send mine in for repair.  It only took Vivitar a few months to get back to me to tell me what they found out. The camera was unrepairable, something about the powersource, basically they didn't know what the problem was. 

I paid around $60 for them to send me a new camera. Good thing I kept almost all my equipment cause I got nothing but the camera in the mail.  
This camera works just fine but it still eats batteries.  Now that I have a PC Camera I rarely use this camera.  

This camera and my computer don't seem to get along. I installed the software with no problem. But if I try to upload pictures from the camera to my computer while using the net it can't find the camera or it tells me the camera isn't on. I have to turn off the net and everything else but the camera software to use it. 

Other than the software problems/conflits with my computer I like my camera. It isn't the best camera but has done its job when working.  <br><br>
