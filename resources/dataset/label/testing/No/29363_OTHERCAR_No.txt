            We bought the Honda CR-V after years of having had major problems with a 1992 Ford Explorer.  We already had a 1996 Honda Accord and Honda had just come out with the New CR-V.  We thought it would be good to try the car out and test drive it.  It was a nice surprised for a four cylinder SUV.  We broke the car in the first week we bought it and drove it around for 1000 miles to Virginia from New York in one week.  It was a great drive and good on mileage.

There are two minor drawbacks with the SUV.  It isn't the best in acceleration, especially when you are going into a highway.   The other is the seats.  The seats are a little stiff.

The car is great in the snow or icy conditions.  It works beautifully on bad weather.  Well worth it.  It is not as smooth a ride as the Ford Explorer, but well worth the other options in comparison.  The CD player sounds great.

A nice overall CR-V.<br><br>
