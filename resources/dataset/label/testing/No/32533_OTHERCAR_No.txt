            FYI: When I first filed this review some months ago, it received a steady stream of positive opinons. More recently, it has received a steady stream of &quot;not recommendeds.&quot;  As an experienced marketing executive myself, my guess is that Saturn Corp. got wind of the review and either hired or ordered a bunch of underlings to submit negative responses. Not nice, but it's done by the same corporate trolls who foist lousy cars upon us. Please read the review and give it your honest response. I wrote it honestly. Thanks!

Utterly disgusted after years of doing battle with the human slimers (read: car salesmen) at other dealers, I gave in to their aggressive marketing and decided to give Saturn a try in 1997. At first, all was rosy. We had a wonderful experience with salesman, who a)didn't chain smoke  b)didn't reek of cheap vodka  c)wasn't dressed head to foot in polyester. Our Saturn guy--call him Earl--actually had an English accent and a college degree. Smooth as silk. Even took our picture--beaming family with bouncing new baby car--before we drove our SC 2 away.

And that's where the happy Saturn story ended. The SC2 turned out to be a true nightmare of auto design gone awry. I have lost track of how many times I yelled out loud, &quot;Didn't anybody drive one of these things before they started producing them?&quot;  To be specific:  
The steering wheel was designed in such a way that it was simply impossible to achieve a comfortable driving position. 
The windshield wipers left about 40% of the windshield unwiped. In rain that was bad; in heavy snow conditions, it was incredibly dangerous.
The seats were as comfortable as those little chairs that tortured us in elementary school.
The rear window was raked at such a low angle that snow remained on it rather than sliding off; without a rear defroster, this became dangerous, also.
The air conditioner was so anemic that it took half an hour to begin cooling the car on an 80-degree day.
Conversely, the heater/defroster was equally anemic, and did little to prevent dangerous icing on sleet or snow days.
The trunk lid was designed in such a way that, when opened on a rainy day, it channelled cascades of water into the trunk. Worse, it had huge protruding hinges that crushed anything fragile inside the trunk when the lid was lowered.
The flipup-flipdown headlights were substandard in some way I could never get Saturn to define, but they did not provide adequate illumination for safe nighttime driving. 

And the vaunted Saturn service really sucked. There were many small screwups, perhaps best symbolized by this occurrence, which happened not once but TWICE:  after routinely changing the oil, Saturn mechanics forgot to torque down the crankcase drain nut. I drove home leaking oil all the way, leaked it all over my garage floor (twice!!), and the dealership did not offer to fix the problem without charge until I demanded it.

I could go on. but in sum this was the worst car I have ever owned, far surpassing even Buicks and Volkswagens for complete, utter worthlessness.
