            I have had this camera for a year now and quite frankly rarely use it anymore.  I must say I am disappointed.  The price has now come down almost $150 since I bought it making it a better buy, but still, I have several issues with it.  Quite frankly I have issues with the digital camera revolution in general, but first: The camera:

1)The viewer: The feature of being able to enlarge (zoom) your photos and recenter your photos on the little screen on the back of camera right when you take 'em is nifty, but fairly useless.  You can't store and lock the photo the way you edited it. When you hand the disk over for processing, the nice zooming and recentering you did is gone.  You then have to pay the film developer shop to "custom crop it" for you after you have them make a print you can mark on.  (I use a photo shop often because printing ink on paper is just not the same as a photo and multiple copies for family or friends just uses way too much ink.  Besides many folks don't have a computer or know how to even open an attachment let alone print one.)  The theory of being able to look at the shot you just took and reshoot is good but most subjects don't (or won't) stand still that long. The moment is lost.

2 )Battery: Using the little viewer on the back just sucks the battery dry way too fast.
Uploading to a computer is even worse.  The hardware interface to bypass the camera for uploading direct from the disk to the computer isn't cheap either.   For this kind of money, an AC adapter shouldn't be an add on.  Rechargeable like a cell phone would be nice. 
 
3)The autofocus : A pain.  It focuses on whatever is in the center of the frame which is rarely, if ever where I want the focus, just like an inexpensive point & shoot.  For this kind of money I would have preferred to focus the camera myself and set it to autofocus only when I wanted it.  To overcome this, I press the shutter part way down, let it focus then move the camera to compose.  Not exactly rapid fire. 

4) The speed from click to click :  (the time you have to wait between shots while the image is transferred to the disk) is unacceptable.  During this time you can't shoot again.  I am used to a tiny wait for my flash to recycle, but not a long wait when there was no flash used.  It just seems forever between the time you click to when the picture is taken.  Trying to take kid pictures or action shots with that kind of delay between clicks is ridiculous.  Add flash operation and you might as well forget it.  

5) If you copy a folder of photos onto the disk (use it like a floppy) and don't remember you've done it or how big it is, the camera may surprise you by telling you the disk is full.  But there is no display to tell you what's on the disk. It will only display the last shots registered.   It is entirely possible to take 1 photo and have it tell you the disk is full.  No file display of your disk contents for all this money. 

6) The little door that opens to the card slot is so fragile and thin that I'm sure it will snap off any time now.

7) There is no camera case!

8) There is no autoflash!  At nearly $500 I have to remember to open the little flash door!
