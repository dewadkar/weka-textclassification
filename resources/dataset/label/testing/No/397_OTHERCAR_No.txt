            I bought the Nissan Xterra based on all of it's features and appearance.  It's roomy and has all the equipment needed for the modern sports person to do what they love. It has a unique tubular roof rack that includes a gear basket that can be removed and can carry up to 30 lbs of dirty or wet items.  It also has a higher roof line allowing more headroom and better seating for passengers in the back.  It also has four-wheel anti-lock brakes and optional items such as power locks, power windows,keyless entry, and an anti-theft system.  This SUV is based on the the Nissan Frontier 4X4 pickup platform and is available in both 2WD and 4WD, in XE or SE models.  Driving this vehicle is like driving a car, nice and smooth.  Everyone who loves sports and looking good should by this car.   <br><br>
