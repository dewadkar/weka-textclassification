            Once upon a time Jaguar was known for agile roadsters. In recent decades, though, its convertibles run about two tons despite their still cramped interiors. A gross perversion of what Jaguars once were? Or is there something about the XK8 to justify its $70,000 price tag?

<b>Styling</b>

No doubt about it, what sells XKs is their styling. Unlike the XJS it replaced, the XK8 at least recalls classic Jag E-Type roadsters in how it looks. Despite the constraint of some carryover structure from the old XJS, the proportions of the XK are near perfect, with perhaps just a bit too much overhang at the ends. The sensuous curves of the body scream Jaguar. Even from hundreds of yards away there is no mistaking this car for anything else. Many find the car absolutely stunning.

The XK8 always looked fine to me with the 17-inch alloys it wore from its intro in 1997 until 2002. For 2003 the standard wheels are 18s, and 19s are a $1,000 option. On the supercharged XKR monstrous 20-inch wheels are a $6,000 option. Those seem almost cartoonish to me, but they are sure to please the bigger-is-better set. 

Inside the XK8 possesses the sort of cozy leather and wood interior that Jaguar is famed for. The uninterrupted plank of highly polished wood that covers the dash from door to door might be a bit much for some, but for those into the whole Jag aesthetic its likely the thing they like best about the interior. A full set of classic white on black round gauges is nestled into this plank, with the auxiliaries in the center. Some of the switches could be a bit more upscale in look and feel, and the thick top lining seems dated in appearance and its loose fit, but otherwise the materials overall are very rich and the workmanship is excellent. 

The top is fully automatic&#151just one button does it all. When up it forms a pleasant roofline. When down it does not fully descend into the body, unlike most other upscale convertibles. Worse, no hard cover covers the top when down. Instead, a flexible boot must be attached, a tedious chore avoided with most competitors.

<b>Accommodations</b>

The driving position is not at all what I expected. I expected to sit low within the car. Instead, you sit high relative to the hood and body, providing the sort of view over these that once typified classic roadsters and is found in the much smaller Miata today. The downside of this seating position is that the windshield header, like the Miata&#146s, intrudes into the view forward more than I personally find comfortable. Also, with the top up headroom is limited and the ambiance is suddenly a touch claustrophobic. A power driver&#146s seat is standard, but I cannot imagine ever wanting to raise it further. Lower it, perhaps. 

I found the front seat surprisingly uncomfortable. It bulged too much in the center, such that the seatback felt convex instead of concave. As mentioned already, despite the exterior size and weight of the XK8 room inside is at a premium. As in much smaller roadsters, there is just enough room for six-footers. The footwells are narrow, so don&#146t plan on lounging about on the highway. On the plus side, the coziness of the interior combined with the driving position to make the XK8 feel much smaller than it is, much more like Jags of yore than I expected.

Like that in the Lexus SC 430, this rear seat seems to have been fitted because there&#146s a larger market for 2+2 convertibles than for two-seaters. It&#146s a very small seat and with the front seats back there is virtually no legroom.   Small children might fit. Adults will only want to ride back there for very short distances and even then only if those in the front seats slide forward a few inches.

Trunk space is typically minimal for this sort of car. A couple of golf bags will supposedly fit, but that&#146s about it. Make your luggage the soft sort. Inside, there is a glove box and a compartment in the center console.

<b>On the Road</b>

For 2003 the engine gained another 200 cubic centimeters, for a total of 4.2 liters, and the automatic transmission (no manual is available) gained another gear, for a total of six. Horsepower goes up by about ten, for a total of 294 at 6000 RPM. (I say "about" because early in the 2003 model year Jag came clean about using DIN numbers in past years, which overstated SAE horsepower by about two percent. So I don't know how much last year's engine actually put out.) Although a 390-horsepower supercharged version of this engine is available for another $12,000, the base engine is plenty, especially given the wide spread of neatly spaced ratios enabled by that extra gear. The XK8 is quick, if not quite stunningly so. Even on the highway I never found myself wishing for more oomph. The transmission, which downshifts readily, deserves much credit.

I've driven the supercharged engine in the S-Type. It felt strong, but not 390 horses strong. All in all, it doesn't feel all that much stronger than the normally-aspirated engine. Magazine reviews suggest it's at most a second quicker to sixty. 

The engine makes enough of the right sort of sounds to lend a sporty aura to the car without seeming out of place in this very luxurious car. In sixth gear on the highway its turning slowly (EPA highway is 26, amazing for such a powerful engine in such a heavy car), thus is very quiet.

The suspension in the XK8 is soft enough to enable a comfortable ride, even with the low-profile performance tires, yet still feels considerably more agile than I expected. I&#146ve already noted the contribution of the driving position. Join this to the XK8&#146s handling, and I felt like I was in a much smaller, lighter car. The moderately low effort steering also contributes. Not that the minimal effort lends a luxo-barge feel. It does not. Despite the level of assist, the steering provides a decent amount of feedback and is quite precise. 

The car asked to be driven playfully, but not aggressively. This is perhaps fitting the car&#146s mission. This wasn&#146t the XKR, after all. It&#146s tuned for comfort more than speed.

Even within the limits of this mission, all was not perfect with the handling. I could never shake the feeling that I was driving a very dated car. Which I was, since bits of the chassis design date back to the 1970s. But it was more than that. Something about the seating position and feel through the wheel and seat of my pants suggested an older, less substantial car. Perhaps this was intentional, a retro driving feel to go with the retro styling. Either way, the sensation was a bit strange, as if there was a small roadster struggling to escape from this big, luxurious body. It just didn&#146t fit with what my eyes led me to expect. Any competitor will feel more substantial and modern.

With the top down buffeting is minimal. With it up, there is little wind noise considering this is a rag top. Thank the thick lining.

<b>Pricing</b>

The XK8 comes standard with just about everything except a navigation system, xenon lamps, and those larger wheels. The list price is just under $75,000, an even five grand over the coupe. Add $675 for the lamps to get the car I drove. Edmunds suggests that dealers sell these for a few hundred over invoice. Figure $69,500. 

A Lexus SC 430 will run you about ten grand less. It was hot when it first appeared, but not recently. It should appeal to the same sort of buyer. I haven't driven the Lexus, but expect a much more modern feel. The top is steel. 

Even though it is about the be redesigned (like the coupe was for 2003), the Mercedes CLK430 remains in short supply, so expect to pay at least the full sticker of $60,000. The Mercedes is a tidier, somewhat less luxurious car than the Jag or Lexus.

Other convertibles in this price range are usually tuned more for aggressive driving. They are a different class of car. Of these, the Maserati probably comes closest in character. I haven&#146t driven this car either, but would expect a much rawer, stronger, harder-edged car. The sticker is around ninety, and I have no clue about the extent of dealer discounting.

Overall, the Lexus seems the better value, but for some people only the extra cachet and style of the Jag will do. For them, the price seems a bit high, but not outrageous.

<b>Last words</b>

I drove this car with my father because he&#146s always loved the XK&#146s style and was slightly considering buying one. He didn&#146t care for the dated feel of the car, though. 

All in all, I found little to hate, but also little to really like about the way this car drove. The handling was in some ways a pleasant surprise, but it just didn&#146t suit the size and styling of the car. The seats need to be closer to the floor, and the car needs to handle more as its large body and elegant interior suggest. 

Of course, those totally in love with the look of the XK8 could care less about anything I can say here. If they have the money they&#146re going to buy this car. Ultimately, this is hardly a bad car, but it is nevertheless all about styling.
