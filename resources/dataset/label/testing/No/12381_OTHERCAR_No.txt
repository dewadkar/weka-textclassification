            This is a great camera if you just want a digital camera to see what all the fuss is about.  Although this one may give you a bad impression of digital cameras.

We'll start with price.  I found mine on clearance at Wal-Mart (a sign that they aren't selling well).  So for $120, I decided to try it out.  

It was fun at first.  You can take pictures and then see them right on the display.  If you don't want that picture, you can delete it, it's that simple.  There are other editing features on the camera, but I find them pretty useless.

The most annoying part about the camera, is getting the pictures off the camera and onto your computer.  The pictures are saved into memory built into the camera.  You have to use a serial cable or IR link.  I couldn't get IR to work on my laptop, so I used serial.  The program that came with the camera did not work.  I had to use PaintShop Pro to import the pictures.

Another annoying point is the color quality.  The pictures usually turn out just plain ugly.  One color usually dominates the whole picture and... well I can't explain it, it's just bad quality.  The picture resolution is also really low.

Other than those downs, it is a decent beginner digital camera.  I wish I had known about the color quality though.  I would have shopped around a little more.<br><br>
