            I bought this car the first year it came out, and although I love the look of it, the service record has gone downhill.  This is a 95 so hopefully Pontiac has realized there were some problems with the car and have corrected them in subsequent years.  At low speeds you get a rather rough ride in this car, and while idling it sounds like the engine is going to cut out on you. This is not a problem a tuneup will fix.  The biggest problem is that with their 2.2L engine, the headgasket develops a crack between 80,000 and 100,000 miles. Pontiac had this same problem with the 94 Pontiac Sunbird.  They admit they know there is a problem with the 95's but will refuse to reimburse you for repairs unless you spend months arguing with their service representatives. I gave up and got a very good price to fix it from a family friend.  Beware though, as you get towards the 100,000 mile mark, that is a repair which will run you probably $700 or more.  Their customer service is poor at best. 

While I like how the car ran the first 4 years, this 5th year has made me back off on buying a Pontiac product in the future.<br><br>
