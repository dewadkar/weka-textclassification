            I have driven 3 different Lincoln Town Cars in the past 15 years. I have really enjoyed the feel of driving them. The power windows, locks, and the keypad on the door are all quite convenient. I have no problem with the interior of the cars I owned. They were all quite spacious and comfortable. The extras like the moon roof and the automatic lights were more than I expected.  The roof never had any leaks and I owned them all for at least 4 years, and did open it occasionally. The automatic light turn off and on and the dimmer were the best.  I really miss the dimmer.
This was truly a luxury car with all the extras.  I only have one complaint, and it is a maintenance one.  The brakes in the town cars that I owned were all needing adjusting about every 3-6 months after the first year. I spent more time on turning rotors and replacing brake shoes than anyone with a luxury car should have to do.  If the FORD company every gets a clue to how this will benefit their vehicles, I may recommend them to someone in the future, but till then, I will drive a LEXUS.<br><br>
