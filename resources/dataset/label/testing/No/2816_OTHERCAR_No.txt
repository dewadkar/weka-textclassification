            Well, first of all, for all of you concerned consumers out there, yes, the Chevy S-10's are horrible in the crash tests.  I think they scored a bad 2/5 stars in the government crash tests.  To this day, the 2001's are bad also.  I guess it's something Chevy hasn't been able to work out.

I had my Chevy S-10 for about 6 months all through the summer for a good lawn mowing truck.  It was a very basic model, which might have been a fleet truck for Coca Cola.  It had 68,000 miles on it when I bought it.  My truck was so basic, the only feature it really had was the driver's airbag.  Not even A/C!  The 5 speed transmission on it worked well.  In 96', Chevy gave the S-10's a new 5 speed tranny to help acceleration and gas mileage.  It seemed to work fairly descent in my truck.  I think I got an average of 24 miles per gallon with a mixture of driving on highway and in town.

The outside of the truck looks good.  Mine was red and had a black grille on the front, which I upgraded to a chrome one.  It helped tremendously!  The inside of the truck is pretty small, just like the average compact truck.  There isn't a lot of room behind the seat to put extra stuff.  The seats are an ok cloth, but get hot in the summer.  It is hard to put people in the middle seat, only my little sister would fit.

Reliability of my truck was pretty good.  I only put about 4,000 miles on it, so nothing even should have gone wrong with it.

I probably wouldn't buy this truck again because of reliability issues with other ones.  If I was going to do it over again though, I would have gotten a more deluxe model.  But now, I would probably go with a Toyota pickup or Nissan Pickup.
