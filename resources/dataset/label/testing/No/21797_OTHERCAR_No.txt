            I brought my 1996 4 door Chevy Tahoe about five months ago because it was big and roomy - just what we were looking for.  I liked the vehicle because it is a very sharp looking truck and the mileage was pretty low. (Now I know why it was so low - it doesn't work too often). I hate the Tahoe because in the five months I've had it it's been in the shop two times. (For a few days at a time.) I've been lucky.  The first time it died was when I was in a gas station in New Jersey.  The other day when it died I was pulling out of my driveway.  When this vehicle does run it's not the smoothest riding vehicle.  When I make sharp turns (not driving at a high rate of speed either) I feel as though it's going to tip - which is a bit scary.  Anyone thinking of buying this type of vehicle should think twice about doing it.  It's good for a person who doesn't mind their vehicle breaking down often and enjoys spending money to have it towed and fixed.  It's not good for a person who's looking for a reliable SUV. I have actually put the towing company on my speed dial since I'm certain I'll need them again. I am so disgusted with this truck that I will never recommend it to anyone and I will NEVER buy another truck/car made by Chevrolet. <br><br>
