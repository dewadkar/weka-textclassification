            I bought this camera the same day I wrote my review on the Relisys.

I spent the rest of the week trying to make the photos look like, well,
recognizable pictures.  I succeeded a couple of times.  It only took me four days of hard labor.  

I nearly smashed my printer, thinking it was my Hewlett Packard Photosmart's fault, when I finally gave up and realized it had to be the camera.  This assumption became more of a belief when I came to the Agfa Digital Camera section of Epinions.com and read other people's reviews.

Digital cameras today remind me of the scanners of yesterday.  Is this just cruel marketing?  Are companies doing this to us to make up for losses elsewhere?  Who knows, but so far, my experience has shown me that a cheap digital camera is not worth owning....at all. 

Or is it, that we should pay more?  Or is it, that even if we did, it really wouldn't matter because the pictures would still not be up to par.  Maybe the software is not caught up with the hardware?  Or visa versa.  Or is it just industry dumping it's rejects on the public, once again, to see how high of a price they can get for well, trash.  

I HATE this camera.  I tried the Agfa Photowise PhotoGenie, I tried 
Microsoft Picture IT, I tried Adobe Photoshop 5.0, I tried Adobe Illustrator 7, and well, I wasted $20.00 of photopaper, and gained a divorce.  Probably because I tried to hard to make it work, and it isn't my character to curse, but that was hard to believe these last few days.

I give up.....I am in tears almost..........Does anyone know of a good
digital camera that won't cost me my next dental work?

I am not stupid.  I used to hold up grids to my monitor for calibration.
I practically killed my mother while attempting to calibrate my monitor with my printer with my software program, back in the mid 90's and even earlier.  It never worked as good as just having a good printer.

That's what I have come to conclude.  All of this photoediting, for what?
An empty nest?

So I packaged it up, even put new batteries in the box, emailed Brandsmall.com who said they would get back to me re: the RMA in 7 - 10 days.  It was just so rude, just so very rude.
