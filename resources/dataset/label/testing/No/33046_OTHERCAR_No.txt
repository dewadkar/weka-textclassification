            Our first family minivan was a Ford Aerostar, and it soon turned out to be a &quot;LEMON&quot; due to numerous electrical problems, a broken main bearing bolt, and A/C major malfunction that the dealer couldn't fix.
 We really wanted a Dodge product, so we traded in the &quot;LEMON&quot; for 93 Dodge Caravan. We knew of previous transmissions problems with this line of vehicles, but thought that problem would have been corrected over the years. 
  We used the van for regular school functions, vacation trips, shopping, but no trailer hauling, racing, or mistreatment. We noticed some transmission problems during the warranty period, but the dealer couldn't identify any problem. Scheduled maintenance was performed and monitored, but the transmission rapidly deteriorated about 90-100K miles. The dealer installed some updated electronic circuitry, but no improvement, and out $300. 
  Eventually, we had the transmission overhauled, and problems continued. Went back maybe 6-9 additional times, changed more components, another torque converter, and the transmission was never right. Too much money spent for any vehicle to justify ever considering another Dodge or Chrysler product ever again. 
  We'll live with a bad case of nerves driving around, listening and feeling there's still a transmission that isn't as good as it should be under the vehicle, at least until the tires need replacing. There are several other conditions that keep us away from considering another vehicle in this line, material quality, poor gas mileage and getting worse, even with regular maintenance. 
  We also own a 90 Honda Accord, used, with 125K miles, and it goes forever. We will buy a Honda minivan, or whatever is there when we are ready, but NOT a Dodge or Chrysler product.<br><br>
