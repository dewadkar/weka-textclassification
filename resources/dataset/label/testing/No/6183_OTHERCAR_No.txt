            Unfortunately we own a 1999 Chevrolet Venture with the Sliding Passenger Door.  I truly believe that the door has a mind of its own!  If a car can be possessed ours is.  This door works only when it wants to, opening and shutting automatically at will.  I have had this car in the shop for more than 12 times in the past year for the same problem.  The door malfunctioning is sporadic and very dangerous for families with small children.  My four-year-old arm was nearly crushed in the door when it closed automatically on him.  I feel like their is some sort of electrical problem with this car and wish I had never bought it.  I know that one day, someone will be really injured with this feature on the vehicle and then MAYBE Chevrolet will listen.  (Look at the other epinions about this vehicle as it relates to the door and you will see that this problem is widespread).<br><br>
