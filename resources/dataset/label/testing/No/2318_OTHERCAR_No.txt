            Purchased a 99 Kia Sephia in June of 99.  Right now the vehicle has 5000 miles on it I am on my 15th trip to the service dept and have had the following replaced: flywheel (part of your motor), transmission, 2 sets of rotors and brakes, power steering pump, power steering train, timing belt, air conditioner belt, fuel pump, fuel tank, fuel gauge, 3 sets of alternater belts and the car still squeals.  I am presently working with my State Attorney and Lawyer to turn this car in as a lemon.  In the upper Ohio valley area there is 4 other Kia sephia owners that are also turning their cars in as lemons.  

Be smart, stay away from this vehicle.  <br><br>
