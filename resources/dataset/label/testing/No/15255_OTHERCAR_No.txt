            I've been playing queen of the loaners this last month or so...my Aztek is critically ill(and when we find out what its ill with, I'll report on that also) and the dealership has been supplying me with epinion resources...ok, I've been getting loaners, but the line sounded much more professional.

These last 4 weeks, I've been driving a Grand Am SE.  I'm not impressed.  I should say that the SE is the least expensive of the Grand Am's and that also plays into my opinion of it.  I've gotten very used to have remote door locks and had to remember HOW to unlock the doors using the key(ok, so do I answer to Princess?...Maybe).  The looks are fine, but there isn't very much room in the car. 

<b>Specifics</b>
 
The Grand Am comes in different styles, sedan and coupe; also there are different grades, what I was driving was the SE, which is the basic model.  The following list includes what is standard on this model:
<i>
Air bags, frontal, driver and right front passenger 
Air conditioning, front manual	 	
Console, front, center, floor, includes floor shifter, integral armrest, lighted shift indicator and storage compartment	 	
Cruise control 
Defogger, rear-window, electric, includes front and side window outlets, driver and front passenger
Power door locks w/delayed locking	
Seat adjuster, manual, driver 4-way, with power height adjustment	 	 	-
Smoker's Package, includes ashtray and lighter	
AM/FM stereo with CD player, 6 speakers and TheftLock 	
Steering column, TILT-WHEEL, adjustable	 	
Sport Steering wheel, 4-spoke	 	
Theft-deterrent system, PASSLock	
Trunk release, power	 
Power windows(includes driver express-down)

Engine, 3.4L 3400 V6 SFI 

107 inch wheel base</i>

All in all, the standard is not bad...I'm spoiled, I like having a remote locking system, but this car does have power windows and automatic lights.  Some of the "standard" items are just show(I'm not impressed about having a "sport steering wheel"), but PASSLock, power trunk release and power locks are almost essential in this day and age and are standard on this model.

There are features on this car that I really liked:

The ignition switch is conveniently located on the dash, making it easy to get going in a hurry and supposedly harder to steal. Automatic headlights can be set to switch on at nightfall. The headlights will automatically turn off 20 seconds after shutting off the ignition. Battery rundown protection automatically turns off all accessory lights after 20 minutes, in case someone forgot to when they exited the car.

<b>  THE DRIVE  </b>

The car drove well, the engine ran smoothly, little or no road noise and the engine performed well.  I could pass without too much problem and had power when I needed it, although it could use a stiffer suspension.  I want more from a car.  I want a comfortable ride, I want some style and gas mileage.  

Ok, the style is good.  I like the way the car looks, more of a sporty look than small sedan.  Pontiac has toned down this years model, but it still is a good looking car.  The interior looks fine--the Pontiac round dashboard is there--its sleek, the sounds are very good and the seats are comfortable--you can easily ride for some time without a back ache...BUT.

I kept wondering what to do with my left knee.  It had to be attached to my leg, but there just didn't seem to be any place to rest my left leg easily while I was driving.  I was either running it into the map door that is built into the car door or the dash.

My husband, who is over 6 feet, felt cramped in the front seat and had to bend over to sit down.  It also seemed that we were forever having to "jump" out of the car...I seemed to have to lift my legs much higher to get out of the car.  Told you I was spoiled!  Actually this could be an issue for people with knee/hip problems.  My mother has had a hip replaced and this could cause her some problems.  My son, who is 5' 6" sat in the back and found it comfortable.  I also sat in the back and thought it ok.

Storage is a joke.  I found the cupholder(built into console) in a very awkward place...right behind the shift.  Although it didn't interfere with the shift, it did interfere with how I placed my arm while driving.  It just got in the way.  There are map "pockets" on the doors and little cubbyholes in the dashboard that aren't large enough to hold anything but dust!  There is an area in the console which is large enough to keep articles, including phone and charger.  There are also 2 cupholders that pop out of the console for people in the back seat, but for the most part, storage is not an option with this car.  Although storage inside the car is at a premium, the trunk has room to spare.  I could do grocery shopping easily, 3 suitcases, sports equipment would all fit fairly easily in the trunk.

The evil gas cap---it wouldn't OPEN!  Pontiac's gas caps click close...when you start clicking, you've closed it enough--I have this on my Aztek, and the Grand Am coupe I drove had the same type.  Only problem was this one STUCK.  Don't know if that's an issue with the car, me or model, but we finally used good ole' lubricant and then it wouldn't get stuck.

<b> The Warranty </b>

Or lack of....what is 3 years, 36K anymore?  That just sucks.  I feel that if I'm going to spend $20K, I should get a warranty that will last as long as the payments...at least.  Most foreign cars offer a much better package when it comes to warranty and its time US makers start paying attention to their customers...and some loyalty.  Dealers give a big push to <i>Buy American</i>.  Well if you want me to buy your product then<i><b> stand behind it!</b></i>

All in all, the car was ok.  Would I buy one?  No, not big enough for my family and I'm not amputating my left leg so I can sit comfortably.  I think there are better cars for better prices in the same range.
