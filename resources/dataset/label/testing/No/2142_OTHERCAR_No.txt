            Just to be clear, I'm reviewing the 2000 VW Golf GLS 1.8 Turbo.

The car is fun to drive.  The engine packs some punch, especially with the 5-speed manual transmission.  Handling is very solid, with excellent tire grip.  Braking is almost too good -- if you do anything but tap on the pedal you're in for a hard stop.  This model comes with 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS and VW's anti-skid system, which I haven't really used yet.  The gas mileage is reasonable -- I average around 30 mpg with mostly highway driving.

Interior comfort is commendable.  Front seats are great, with plenty of legroom for a 6'5" guy like myself.  Back seats are average.  The interior materials are aesthetically pleasing and have a high-quality finish, although one of the glovebox hinges broke for absolutely no reason.

Which takes me to reliability.  Luckily nothing major has gone wrong (yet), but a lot of minor stuff has.  First, there were the power windows -- the "regulators" broke three times before VW started an informal recall, which basically means they'll fix it for free now if you keep it quiet.  The original tires wore unevenly and had to be replaced.  The locks and alarms do strange things -- I often have to unlock and then lock again to get all the doors to lock.  Light bulbs blow faster than they should -- seems to be a common problem with other VWs I see on the road.  They're relatively easy to change if you want to do it yourself.  Some mysterious squeaks and rattles have developed, but I guess that's par for the course.

I personally would recommend going Japanese instead, or at least purchasing one of the VWs that are still made in Germany.  I don't know of any truly reliable cars made in Mexico or Brazil.

But the turbo does keep things interesting.  And it is a very cute-looking car, which I guess is why you see so darn many of them.
