                Take this opinion for what it's worth.  I don't actually own this car, in fact, I don't own any car.  I prefer walking or public transportation.  Since I live within a block of campus and within a short bus ride from where I work I can't really justify owning a car.  However, I drive the Outback quite a bit.  It's my mother's car.  I drive it when I go back home to visit, I have taken it on dozens of road trips and I actually did get to take it back to school for a full semester last year, that was a nice luxury at first.  Towards the end of the semester, though, I was looking forward to taking it back.

    My mom bought the 2000 Outback in late 1999...she traded in her Honda Civic for it.  I was crushed.  The Civic was wonderful, but that's for another review.  I had a bad attitude towards it right away since I can't stand death traps, I mean SUV's, and this car is basically an SUV.  I also knew gas mileage would be much worse than the Honda and it would be tougher to find a parking space for it.  After driving it for a while I found both to be true.

    When I drove the Honda from home in Chicago, to school in Lincoln, Nebraska I would have to fill the tank up once after about 350 miles.  The Honda had a 10 gallon tank.  The Outback, on the other hand needed to be filled up after 325 miles and it had a 12 gallon tank.  That's almost seven miles per gallon less.  But, that was only interstate driving.  City driving seemed much worse.  While I had the car here in Lincoln, I had to fill it up all the time.  And I wasn't driving all that much.  But still, I guess it beats a real SUV.

    As for the parking...if there is one thing in the world I am good at, no great at, it is parallel parking.  If it is possible to fit a car between to others I can get it in without damaging any of the cars involved.  In fact, I have often been compared to Michael Jordan in this aspects...I'm quite possibly the greatest parallel parker of all time.  By the way, I welcome any challenges, we'll have a "Park-Off."  With that said, the Outback was still more difficult to park than the Honda.  The Outback is simply just too big to fit into a lot of spots, and even I can't shrink the car to get it into a space.  

    Those are the two obvious things, though.  You'd expect that from any large vehicle.  Let me tell you about some of the details that bugged me.

    First of all this car has the worst cup holder I have ever seen.  It's located directly above the CD player/radio, and it's one that you have to push in to get it to pop out.  Well, if you pop it out and want to use it, you better make sure you don't want to listen to music, or at least have the only CD in you want to hear.  You can not get a CD in when the cup holder is out.  On top of that, it is a flimsy holder and struggles to hold a 20 oz. bottle of pop.  You can forget about a Big Gulp, or anything else that is tall.

    Next, the sun roofs.  Or moon roof, whatever you want to call them.  The one over the back seat is OK, but the one in the front won't open.  You can only tilt it forward so it cracks open in the back.  What good does that do?

    Finally, the wind shield wipers.  This is actually a real safety problem.  Earlier this winter, during out winter break.  I drove the car from Chicago to Nebraska.  On the way back I ran into a terrible snowstorm just as I entered Iowa from Illinois.  Everything was fine at first, but as the snow got heavier my windshield got dirty.  So I tried to use the window washer fluid and nothing worked.  I pulled over at a gas station to fill it up again with fluid.  To my surprise I could see plenty in there.  I turned out that the little hose from the tank to the windshield wiper was disconnected.  I stuck it back in, but it still wouldn't work.  So I continued without the fluid.  Soon the snow got wet and heavy enough to clean the windshield with each wipe.  I cruised along just fine for another hour or so with the wipers going.  Then, suddenly the wiper on the drivers side stopped as the other one kept going.  The got stuck together for a second, then separated again.  The drivers side was only going half way up.  Then, on my way into a gas station to try to fix it, it flipped off the windshield all together and ended up pinned to my window on the left side.  It was still attached to the car, but barely.  When I finally pulled over I tried to fix it.  I put it back in place and hoped it would work.  Of course it did not, it just flipped to the side again.  After several stops to try to correct the problem I gave up and decided to not use the wipers at all.  That lasted about fifteen minutes before conditions got too bad to continue.  I ended up pulling over and waiting about 45 minutes for a break in the snow before pulling out again.  It took me 12 and a half hours to get back to Lincoln that night...it should only take 8.  The windshield wipers added over 4 hours to the trip.  When I told my mom about the problem, she told me it happened to her several times.

    Well, there are a few reasons not to buy this car.  It isn't worth it.  Gas costs, parking problems, a pretty inferior product overall.  It just seems like it was built very cheap without much concern for quality.  To be fair, however, I should mention that it's safer than an SUV and comfortable and very spacious inside.  That's where the positives end.  If you have the money to spend, spend it on a quality car, which you'll probably be able to find cheaper anyway.  Plus it will save you lots of gas money to buy a smaller car.  Remember bigger doesn't mean better.
