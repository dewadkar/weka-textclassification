            I bought this car for its sporty look and cargo capacity.  So far, I have found it to have good acceleration and it is indeed roomy.  It maneuvers fairly well, but can be difficult to back because of obstructions.  My chief complaint has been reliability problems.  That glitzy dashboard has been the source of continual rattles--it has been back to the shop 7 times to deal with bugs.  Some fellow owners acknowledge that dashboard rattles seem common.  
       In driving several other Vibes (to see if my problems are unique), I have noted that all those I drove tended to have noisy brakes (especially when backing on an incline),  and some have noisier motors than mine.      
      The cargo floor can be inconvenient, as tie-downs are not very practical;  my luggage slid all over the place on my first trip. 
      It is too early for me to judge the durability and long-term quality of this vehicle.  But I do fear that the stylish exterior hides a cheaply built economy car.   If you are intent on buying this vehicle, I suggest that you check out the prospective car carefully for potential bugs.
