            At first I thought I'd like having an Land Rover.  After all, it is of European design, and it stands apart from all the Honda CR-V's and Toyota RAV-4's on the road.  As the weeks past after getting it, my wife and I realized that this car was not for us.  
  We live in Arizona on the Navajo Indian reservation, so an off road car was actually something that we could use.  If you are looking for something with great off-road capability, this is the car for you.  I took it through streams, over sand dunes, and through the desert.  This car will go anywhere.  But that is pretty much the only great thing about this car.
  One of the first problems I noticed is that the a/c was very weak.  I felt like it wasn't even on sometimes.  I just opened the windows when it was 95 degrees out so I could get some wind on my face.  The fan is noisy and barely makes any wind.  The dealer checked it out and said that it was working up to manufacturer specs.  (Perhaps the factory specs for the a/c are done in England in January)  I had the windows tinted, but that only helped minimally.  
  Next, the gas mileage is terrible.  I got 17 to 23 mpg.  That was painful at the pumps for me.  But with most SUV's the gas use is pretty heavy.  But I think Land Rover could have designed the car with more horsepower if the mileage was going to be that bad.  Perhaps a manual transmission would solve that problem.  
  Seating was comfortable for an average sized person.  Strangely, the drivers seat could not be adjusted in any direction other than forewards or backwards.  Back seat room was reasonable.  The back seats are 3 inches higher to allow better vision for back seat drivers.  
  I found the trunk to be suprisingly small for a car this size on the outside.  I could hardly fit a stroller and groceries on my trips to the store.  
  On-road handling I found to be pretty good for an SUV.  I found this car to be MUCH more stable at high speed (75mph or so) than either the CR-V or the RAV-4.  It felt solid, not cheap like the Japanese SUV's.  The only SUV that I felt as confident on the highway on was the Jeep Liberty. The Freelander will even cruise on flat ground at over 100 mph, which was pretty nice, as long as I didn't need to swerve or stop suddenly.  
  Speaking of stopping, the brakes were pretty poor.  I almost got into a few accidents because I was used to cars that stopped right away when you stepped on the brakes. 
  Little things also annoyed me about the car.  Example:  You have to take the key out of the ignition to open the gas cap.  So while you're at the pumps, your passengers aren't able to put down the windows or turn on the radio while they are waiting.  So if it's 95 degrees out, they will just have to bake unless they catch you before you get out of the car.    Another annoying thing:  Why in the world does this car have such a small gas tank???  I think it is 15.5 gallons.  There were some times when I could only go 230 miles on a tank.  That is crazy, especially for me since gas stations out here are sometimes over 100 miles apart from each other.  I was afraid to go on a long off road trip for fear that I'd run out of gas.
  To make a long story short.  I sold the car after only 4 months, and now am a very very happy driver of a Audi A4 Avant.  No, I can't go off road any more, but at least the a/c is cold, I can go 350 miles on a tank of gas, the brakes work, and I can fit my groceries and my stroller in the back!
