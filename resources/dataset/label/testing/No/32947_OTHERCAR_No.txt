            I own a 1997 Range Rover 4.0SE and sad to say that I should have purchased an ML 430 or the new BMW X5.  The car is pricey and lacks power.  What this car has that its competitors don't have is the awesome off-road ability able to drive through the rigorous of roads.  But then, would you be taking this pricey car off-roading.  I didn't.  The car is the slowest in its class carrying a decent engine and huge amount of weight.  Even the 4.6HSE is considered slow being only a second faster in acceleration from 0-60mph.  The car handles fairly but nothing compared to the ML 430 or BMW X5.  This is because of its offroad suspension.  Other cars to consider are the Lexus LX470 which is about the same and beats the Range Rover all sides in performance except braking.  The Range Rover carries huge disk breaks that allows the car to stop within couples of heartbeats.  The thing I love about it is its beautiful interior and lots of room for cargo and my dogs.  I love its styling too.
Buy this only if you offroad, for city driving buy a ML430 or BMWX5.  I wasn't intending on offroading it so maybe I prefer something else.<br><br>
