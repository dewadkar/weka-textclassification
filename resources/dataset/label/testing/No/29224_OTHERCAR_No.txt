            For more than ten years I boycotted American cars due to previous bad experience with Oldsmobile's, Cadillac's, and Chryslers. I don't need to dwell on the problems I had because they were well known among people who drove them during that time.

I owned Nissan MAXIMA's and Toyota Avalons that were flawless cars with no rattles and zero service problems during my ownership. My Avalon was up there in miles so I needed a new car, a larger one.

The 2000 Lincoln Town Car is stunning! I bought it because the dealer gave me huge incentives ($8000 off) and a rebate to boot. The car is smooth and quieter than any American car I have been in. The dash is of better fit and finish than any American product, though not up the standard of the Japanese or European cars.

The car has an 8-cyl 4.6L engine that is way undersized for the car. After having an Avalon that was quick, this car is slow but it is also larger so I accept that compromise.

I have had to have the drive shaft replaced three times because it vibrated above 50mph. There are a few small rattles in the car and the a/c fan motor is sometimes noisy. There is only 1100 miles on the car!

The leather workmanship is much better than before and the interior is well done. The frame is very solid and the door handles have a solid look and feel to them.

I am large and formerly athletically built which means I need a car this size. For those of us who are large or have a large family, this is the only car to get.

For those of you who want the quickest acceleration and maneuverability this is not the car for you.

This car has now been in the shop 5 times for the vibration above 50mph. I was blamed by the dealer in Woodbridge Virginia to have damaged the driveshaft and they in fact charged me labor to fix it. The car was less than 2 days old with 300 miles on it, under warranty and they charged me for it! Guess what. It still vibrates as of mid August.

All problems I have reported on this car have blamed on me as operator error. The dealer did replace the air conditioning fan because it was noisy.

This car has been a miserable experience and I do not reccommend the Lincoln Town Car at this time.

Don't ever let any car dealer blame you for a problem you didn't cause and don't ever let them charge you for anything that should be covered under warranty!
