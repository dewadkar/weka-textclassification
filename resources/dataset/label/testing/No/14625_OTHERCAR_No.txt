            I am writing to inform the reader about two potential problems with purchasing a new Volvo.  The first problem is purely technical and actually the lesser of the two problems.  My most recent Volvo, the S70, a T5 version has an electrical problem that results in the car not starting after 3-4 days of inactivity.  This problem, which the dealer is still trying to correct, is vexing and troublesome, especially for people who often travel and leave their car at the airport.  I understand that the problem is not related to my specify automobile but according to the dealer is a design defect that is impacting a large number of that model. 

The second problem is much broader and more unfortunate, and that is of customer service.  In the past I believe that Volvo ownership was like being part of a unique family.  The cars were extremely reliable, and a good value given their long life.  However since the purchase of Volvo by Ford I believe that the value proposition has changed for the worse.  Specifically the product has changed in quality and both the corporate office and dealers of Volvo's are no longer interested in retaining the family feel through previously excellent customer service.  I know personally that I have had significantly more problems on the S70 than the previous 960 which I still own.  More importantly instead of the corporate office (in New Jersey) and local dealers standing behind the product, they have resorted to price gouging for spare parts and much lower levels of service.  In summary, being a Volvo owner is now no different than owning a Ford car.  Except however the initial purchase cost is higher, the spare parts more expense, and the dealers fewer and farther between.   <br><br>
