            I owned one of these cameras for less than one day so it's hard to remember the specifics, but in a nutshell:

Unlike any other digital camera I've ever seen, it has a manual exposure system. Not creative control, just bare survival: sunny, cloudy, indoors bright, and indoors dark.

If you set it right, the pictures are probably the best I've seen from an under $100 digital camera.

Unlike many bottom end digital cameras, this one has a flash. BUT you have to turn it on, even if you've set the exposure to indoors, dark.

All these different settings are made by cycling through an 8 position menu. The button is small and hard to push, and the camera beeps with each push.

The bride is ready to come down the aisle. Turn on the camera, set indoors -- beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beeep. Now for the flash beep, beep, beep, beep, beeeep. 

Ok, she's coming. blip! Did I mention. It automatically powers off after only 30 seconds. On most cameras a bit annoying and inconvenient, but the really bad news is when you turn it back on it has forgotten all your settings! You've got to do it again.

By the time you get the picture of the happy couple, they'll be back from their honeymoon.

P.S. if the camera doesn't disappoint you, the software will.
