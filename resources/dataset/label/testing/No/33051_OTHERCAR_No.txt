            Granted, it is used, but it is from the nineties.  I have a 1993 Dodge Grand Caravan, and so far it is the worst car/van I have ever owned.  I have had it for 2 years and have had to get the transmission fixed for over a thousand dollars, and the breaks had to get redone.  We got the transmission fixed last year and we are still having problems with it.  The mechanic said that the transmission on these kind of vans are very temperamental, and I have the proof.  Lucky for us, we have a warranty on our transmission work so we don't have to pay for the times we have had to take it back because it freaked out again.  This van has under 90,000 miles on it, and I would trade it in for any other van at this point.  <br><br>
