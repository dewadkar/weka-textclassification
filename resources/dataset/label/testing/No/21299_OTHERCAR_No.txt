            As goes the warranty, so goes the car's performance!  I owned a four cylinder, 2.2 liter Plymouth Sundance America and also the &quot;pocket rocket&quot; six cylinder, 3.0 liter Plymouth Sundance Duster.  Both cars had automatic transmissions.  The Sundance America was a 3-speed, and the Duster was a 4-speed (3 speed w/overdrive) which is achieved by utilizing a lock-up torque converter.

I was attracted to these cars because they offered a lot of car for a reasonably affordable price tag.  However, I soon learned that Chrysler cannot deliver...even under warranty!

The Duster had many chronic problems.  Drive Train: The car had great pick-up, even with A/C going, but the transmission shifted very roughly.  Even when rolling to a stop, the car would downshift with a startling jerk.  Of course, the dealer could NEVER find a specific problem &quot;until it totally fails&quot;.  Finally, the transmission DID totally fail as did the warranty.  This car died at 70,000 miles young!  The culprit was the lock-up torque converter.  Electrical:  The electrical system was faulty where the dashboard would only be half-illuminated unless I tapped on the dash.  And, the speedometer would jump all over the dial...symptomatic of other electrical problems.

On the Sundance America, the A/C died at 7,000 miles which was fixed under warranty.  Then, the steering developed a terrible rubbing noise which my friends described as a &quot;dead rat&quot; in the steering column.  The dealer's mechanic found a problem in a union joint, but the dealer refused to fix the problem.  Instead, they attempted to hide it with a quick-fix of lubrication.  This grew into a major fight, and Chrysler themselves remained silent when I wrote directly to Iacoca himself.

Advantage Chrysler?  Not!  FYI, at the same time, my sister owned a Dodge Shadow America, the twin of the Sundance.  Likewise, her 3-speed automatic transmission was sluggish and hesitant to shift into higher gears.  Then, she traded it in for a Dodge Neon with a sluggish transmission also.

It's a shame, overall.  While I will say the engines of all these cars seemed to purr, Chryslers are plagued with chronic transmission problems.  Especially automatics which never seem to know in which gear to operate.  These were fun cars to drive...until the troubles started.

I would not recommend Chrysler products.  The luring price tag is a ploy.<br><br>
