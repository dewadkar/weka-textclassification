            Ahhh, where should I start.  I went to the auction a month ago and picked up this car for $2200.  It has 112,000 miles and seems to be in excellent condition.  However, the cars powertrain seems very "tweeky".  By that I mean it does not have the smooth turbine like power of a luxury V8.  It howls and pulls (like all FWD cars).  On that note I was very disappointed.  On to the inside.  Very nice.  Seems well appointed perhaps with to many gadgets, but the JBL stereo is awesome.  The air bag system is annoying as all get out, because you can hear the pump inflating the bags, then deflating, then up again depending on the vehicles speed.  Very silly and very expensive.  Actually the whole darn car is expensive as far as parts go, even though when its all said and done it nothing more than a fancied up Taurus or Sable.  I have been really disappointed in the one month that I have owned this car.  Nothing major mechanically, just not what I expected from a Lincoln.  After getting the car home, found out that the 3.8 liter engines were so hard on head gaskets, that Ford actually extended the warranty to 7 years/100,000 miles.  I looked at my engine and could tell the heads had been removed, so that was a good thing, but I am still waiting for it to happen again.  Ya well, dont want to bash the car to hard, I am just glad I stole it at auction, because if I would have paid anymore I would have been real upset.  At least I might be able to use it as a trade in on a new Mustang, or maybe they wont even want it.  Who knows.
