            I bought my 1996 Plymouth Voyager Mini van new and have had it 4+ plus years now. Overall the maintenance cost has been somewhat reasonable, however this last repair bill has wiped me out. I have had problems from day 1 with the window wipers in this vehicle. The original problem was with the wipers would suddenly going on for no reason. It was rare at first, then the instances would increase until it was a problem. Under warranty the dealer fixed the problem, replacing multi-function switch. It worked fine for one and a half years, then the problem returned. Again the same problem, except the van was out of warranty and I paid the bill to fix the wipers.
One year and 10 days later, the wipers don't work at all! I brought it back to dealer for inspection. I waited 2+ hours for a technician to find the problem is with the BODY CONTROL MODULE and that it needs replacing.

Cost of diagnosis:  $73.94 
Cost of new BCM:   $358.00
Labor to install:   $69.95
Total Repair:      $501.89

Time to order and replace BCM: 1+ week
This is X-MAS holiday week and I cannot drive the van when there is a chance of rain.

That�s over $500 to fix the windshield wipers, this does not include the previous repair bill. I contacted Chrysler for assistance in this bizarre cost of wiper repairs being that they were repaired twice before. Obviously there is a design flaw in the system and it was not designed to minimize repair costs. Chrysler�s response was that the car was out of warranty and I'm out of luck and $500.00.

LESSON LEARNED:
CHRYSLER DOES NOT STAND BY ITS PRODUCTS, SO BUYER BEWARE!
