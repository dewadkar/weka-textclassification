            I bought a 95 dodge intrepid in 97 with 36,000 miles on it. This car had allot of power and cornered like nothing I had ever drove. After it reached 75,000 miles things started going wrong. Both tie rods went out. These must be ordered right from Chrysler at 85.00 dollars each. Next the timing belt broke. Now forget fixing this yourself unless you are a master repairman. So if you only plan on keeping your car for 50,000 miles then I would recommend looking else where for a car.<br><br>
