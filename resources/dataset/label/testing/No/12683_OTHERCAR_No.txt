            I bought the Chevy Cavalier because, it seemed to be a good value.  However, in my months of owning it, I've discovered that the trivial things I didn't think would bother me much are overwhelming at times.  The drink holder is positioned either a) under my elbow in the armrest or b) too close to the radio where a McDonald's large cup interferes with using the radio buttons, or pushes in a cassette that's sticking out a little bit. 

Also, I'm very tall (6 foot 4) with a long torso, and the layout of the windshield, sun visors, mirrors, side windows, etc is all very wrong.  the blind spots, which are well placed from my 5 foot 5 wife's perspective are, though not dangerous, inconvenient from mine.  

On the plus side, the car handles very well, particularly for the sticker price, and it's light enough to push w/ just one helper when bad weather pushes you into a ditch.<br><br>
