            I want to state this in no uncertain terms - this is the worst car I have ever seen.  It's not just the mechanical defects, it's also the inept people behind the inferior product.  My wife bought a new SC Coupe in 1996 primarily because she needed reliable transportation at an affordable price.  Here we are 4 years and 52,000 miles later and we've already traded it in.  During the brief time she owned the car it needed 3 major engine repairs.  The head gasket blew.  A rear seal needed to be replaced.  And then it started burning oil.  I discovered the last problem while having the oil changed (I do this every 3,000 miles) the mechanic told me the car was down 2 quarts.  I assumed I had a leak.  He said no it's burning oil.  I immediately drove to the Saturn dealer where the car was purchased.  The gentlemen I spoke with said that the car might be burning because it has an oil lubricated timing belt.  I find that interesting considering my Protege doesn't burn any oil and it has 140,000 miles on it.  He asked that I come back in 1,000 miles so they can do an oil consumption test.  I was unsatisfied with these answers.  I called back during the week and spoke with the service manager.  He also advocated the oil consumption test and recommended we take the car to another dealer who had done the most recent repairs.  Nothin' like passin' the buck whenever you can.  He said there was nothing that can be done until they see the results of the test.  He also claimed that a car burning oil at 52,000 was not entirely uncommon.  I don't know what kind he's driven but I'll state for the record that no car should burn oil at 52k.  When I referenced the repairs, he reviewed the car's history and said - &quot;...you really haven't done that much work.&quot;  This man should not be a Service Manager!  To all those reading this, if you buy new your first 60,000 miles should be repair free.  Then you do the timing belt and then you should be okay for another 30,000 or more (you probably have to do brakes and exhaust work - but that's routine stuff).  At this point I had had enough of the dealership, I decided to call the Saturn headquarters.  I spoke with an Area Manager named &quot;Kevin&quot; who was not at all helpful.  When I told him the frequency of repairs he said that this could have happened with any car.  When I said that this shouldn't happen with a car this new, he said that this was only &quot;my opinion.&quot;  I told him about my Mazda and how much more reliable it was.  He also said that all repairs had been covered by the warranty and the car had been serviced in accordance with the agreement.  I told him that when people buy a service contract they don't anticipate using it every week.  Moreover, he said that the local Saturn service department would be best equipped to help me.  More buck passing, Idiot #2 sent me back to Idiot #1.  

I have concluded a few things:

I will never buy another Saturn.  Me and &quot;my opinion&quot; will take our business elsewhere.
The Service Manager knows little to nothing about cars.  If an engine burns 2 quarts it is not because of the timing belt!  Furthermore it is reprehensible for him to even suggest that I go somewhere else.  Saturn is Saturn - any of their dealerships should welcome the idea of repairing my car.  
Also, if the Service Manager at Saturn sees that a Saturn this new has this many problems and thinks nothing of it - Saturns must be junk.  
I can't help but wonder why he never even pulled the dipstick -isn't that the first thing that comes to mind when talking about oil.
&quot;Kevin&quot; needs to learn some common sense.  If a car performs that badly it was not assembled properly.  The head gasket was done wrong at the factory.  This car was a lemon from day one.  If all he can do is recite the corporate lingo and refer me to the dealer - he's useless.

Hey, Saturn - I dare you to respond to this.
