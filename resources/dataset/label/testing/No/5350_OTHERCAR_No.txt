             We loved our van, it ran like a deer! The idea of a 4 door van really lured me. Now i dread the day i ever signed the loan papers. When we purchased our van, we had just had our second child. We needed something bigger.Our 4 door sedan just wasn't big enough for 2 carseats. For the first 60,000 miles we never had a problem, aside from new tires and oil changes. After that it all went down hill. The first problem i had was with the cruise control. The dealership has yet to figure out the problem after 4 times in the shop. The next problem we encountered was a costly one. We had to replace both windshield wiper motors and the multi- function switch. We have an oil leak,exhaust problem,the ABS system is on the fritz , not to mention the transmission. I will never buy another one. I would however lease one for 32,000 miles. Once the factory warranty is gone, you couldn't give me one.<br><br>
