            At this point if you are purchasing or considering a 2001 Maxima, then you are shopping used vehicles.  You're also probably wanting to consider things like reliability, and "bang for the buck."  From what the other reviewers have already told you, and from what you can read in Consumer Reports, or Edmunds,  you also know that the Maxima will give you both performance and reliability.

I purchased a 2001 Black Maxima SE Anniversary Edition (AE).  The Anniversary Edition is the SE with some upgrades (including auto-dimming rear view mirror, some titanium finishes, Inifiniti 227 HP engine).  The car had 26,500 miles when I bought it, and now has 26,700 one week later--&gt;yes, its that much fun.

Make sure you thoroughly test drive your vehicle, and try to run it over the types of roads and paths that you are normally going to be driving every day.  If you only like it on the open road, but your daily commute is all stop-and-go, well then its a bad choice for you. 

I say this because of a few things:

--The SE edition really "feels" the road.  Its a firm ride, and can be bumpy if you're not used to it.  The stock tires bring in a lot of noise, but the engine is very quiet.  It feels most imperfections in the road.

--The flip side of the above is that it corners very well, and I cannot believe how fast I can go around curves without any complaint from the tires, or the body of the car.  No creaking or groaning.  I drive a very curvy road to work and back every day, and when the traffic lets up, I get to have a ton of fun.

So, keep your commuting needs in mind.  I've read that the GLE has a much softer suspension, and it seems to fit the needs of those who don't need or want the extra performance capabilities in terms of handling.  The engines in all the Maximas except the Anniversary Edition are the same, and I doubt that extra 5 HP I get makes much difference.

I love the look of the car, but that's a subjective thing.  To me, Camry's and Accords, while fine cars, are rather bland compared to Nissan's stylings.  But that's personal, of course.

Other issues of concern, or to keep in mind:

1.  My stock stereo isn't all that good.  The back speakers are very weak, and for some reason talk radio causes vibration, while music is OK.  I've temporarily faded everything to the front speakers, until I can put my aftermarket stereo/speakers in it.  I hear that the Bose is better.  Make sure you fade the speakers back and forth during your extended test drive.

2.  Wind noise/rattles.  If you read Edmunds and Maxima.org, you'll find plenty of posts about people with wind problems and rattle problems.  I think these problems tend to get compounded by the fact that overall its a very quiet, smooth car, so you can hear extraneous noise better.  There are actually TSB's (Technical Service Bulletins) on these, so you can get them taken care of under warranty.  Obviously, its easier to get whoever you're about to buy the car from to take care of them before you buy it.

Most of these noises don't show up before you hit 60 mph, so make sure you do some highway test driving.  I have the popular "passenger rear window excessive wind noise" in mine--but this one is so common, the Nissan shop I called said "yep, bring it in"--they already know what to do with it. 

Overall, I love the car very much.  I'm six foot five, and fit in it even with a sunroof.  I have headroom, legroom, and can still fit people in the vehicle comfortably.  The power, while not as much as the 2002 models, is more than enough for your average to above average driver.  I love the looks, and the handling.  No car in this price range is perfect, and all cars will have to make compromises somewhere.  But to me, this vehicle has the right mix of sportiness and practicality  that is extremely rare amongst most four dour sedans that are not BMW's. 

I will post updates as my miles rack up.

Update #1 (12-12-02)
I now have 31,000 miles on the car (I commute a good distance), and still am very happy with the purchase.  The vehicle has had some issues:

1.  Rotor warping
2.  Ignition Coils malfunctioning, which causes the Service Engine Soon light to come on .

Both of these were covered under warranty.  As well, the speaker issue that I mentioned earlier was covered by the warranty (nice surprise).  So while I still don't find the stock speakers to be the greatest, with no rattles its not awful anymore.

I'm still very comfortable in the car.  One strange thing, though that I've noticed is that you have to be very careful getting in the car if you have the parking brake engaged.  The Parking lever will stab you in the thigh if you don't watch it.  :)  

I've also found www.maxima.org to be a very helpful site.  Use their FAQ in the forums, and you can find most issues that crop up.  You do have to wade through plenty of 'racer boy' types, but they also have plenty of well informed people who will help you out.

I still enjoy the power, and the reliablity, and in my opinion, the "good looks."  All the issues I had were relatively minor, and nothing that has left me stranded or without transportation.

Hope this helps.


Update #2 (7-25-03).  Some Frustrations.

Well, the car is starting to show more problems, and none of them cheap.  At 43,000 miles now, and another O2 sensor has gone out, and now I'm beyond warranty, so the dealer says that's $375 thank-you-very-much.  There's a terrible noise coming from the right side of the car when I turn, which could be a CV joint.  I'm hoping its covered by the powertrain warranty.  
The glass has cracked, and apparently from what I've read, Maxima glass is a real issue.  Make sure you get class coverage on your insurance, unlike me.  (another nearly 400 bucks for this).

Overall I still love its looks, but at this rate, I'm staring at both monthly payments for the car and NOW monthly payments for the maintenance.  

I'm very close to changing my recommendation to a "NO" and asking people to look at Camry's instead.  They may be more "boring" but the Maxima's supposed reliability is going way down in my experience.  I'm definitely dropping a star off the review, based on reliablity and dealer costs alone.
