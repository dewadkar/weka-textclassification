            I thought that I would really like this vehicle.  I have a love/hate relationship with it.  I love it with the top off,and hate it because it is so hard to put the top back on.  It is good in the snow,though.  It does not have the space needed for a shopper like me,or the space for all my grandchildren toys,and them.  I leave the toys at their house and take them. My 1999,Tracker,is not a car I would recommend to anyone with small children,pets,and who likes to go shopping. <br><br>
