            What would you expect if you had a Plymouth Neon? Perhaps a reliable, sporty car that looks good and hugs the road. You will get that much. Other than that, I think this piece of junk is highly overrated. 

It plays on the 'I'm a cute car, ladies will dig me' factor. If I think about the number of Neon owners I know, or record how many I see, more women than men own this car. All chauvinism aside, it is a woman's car. 

You can get lots of goodies with this car. The expresso version of this car comes with power everything, a sunroof, and an AM/FM tape deck stereo system. It doesn't come with a lot of room.

I've heard Neon owners say that it has all the room in the world. Well, that is said by them because they have their <b>SEATS ALL THE WAY BACK!</b> I mean, if I did that in my Taurus, I would have lots of room in front, but people in the back would still have room too. 

The back seat has room only if you have a small person driving up front. The Neon is probably the biggest waste of money on a compact car. You want compact? Get a Honda Civic.<br><br>
