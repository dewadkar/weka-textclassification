                When I wanted to start taking pictures of everyday scenes I looked for a small camera with good picture taking possibilities. Most cameras that are digital for under $150.00 are 1.0 mega Pixel. This one has software to make it 2.0 mega pixel and I though, "Wow what a deal, and look it has audio and video recording I must get this"! So I bought it and I was pleased for about three seconds. The camera has no flash and indoor pictures don&#146t come out well at all unless you have a really lit up location. There is only built in room for 11 high quality pictures, enough room to record about 20 minutes of audio, and enough room to record about 1 minute of video. A CF (Compact Flash, or memory) card is needed. 
    The camera came with a small tripod, cable to link to the USB port on your computer to transfer your files, CD full of software that does not work well. Most of the software has 1/2 of the functions locked unless you upgrade. I did not upgrade any of it. The LCD screen is small but what could I expect. Its lit up but you can turn off the back light to save batteries and you have to do this if you want your batteries to last more than one two uses. 
    There is a small mirror in the front for self pictures but I cut my head off often. The video is awful, if you want to record something quickly its perfect but otherwise use a better video recorder with more frames per second and recording space. The audio is fine for recording lectures and speeches but it too is a bit scratchy and when you move the camera even a little bit its picked up. This sounds awful on the play back. 
     If you plan on getting a CF card for this camera listen to the instruction manual or call up the company. MANY CF cards do not work with this camera especially PNY cards! I had to learn that the hard way. There is no zoom and the shutter speed is terrible. If you record a moving object it will become badly blurred. Even a car going 15 was blurred a bit when I took a picture of it. The colors are terrible and it takes a lot of red out of pictures but that can easily be added in by a photo editing software. 
     Its not that easy to use and you cannot turn it on fast or off fast enough for my likings. Its a bit big to fit in your pocket, very uncomfortable.
