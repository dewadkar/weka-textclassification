            I, like so many others, have been caught up in the Sport Utility craze for awhile now.  I was drawn to the Jeep by it's strong reputation as a &quot;class leader&quot; for dependable transportation, economy and long life.  I own a 1997 Cherokee Sport, 4-door, 2WD as my primary vehicle.  I currently have 91,000 miles on the odometer and have been plagued by nagging little problems since purchase.

It started with a tape player that didn't play.  After 4 trips to the dealer, without once leaving to the sounds of my favorite cassettes, I solved the problem by purchasing an after-market CD-player.  The next problem that showed up was a gas guage that didn't guage.  Finding myself stranded (at 4 am) with over a quarter of a tank registering, I started to become a little &quot;concerned&quot; with my recent purchase.  After encountering other owners that were having the same problem, I received a Recall Notice offering a new tank sending unit.  Sorry, but I still drive on the trip odometer and have to manually check the vehicle mileage when necessary (once burned...twice shy...).  Then I noticed that to keep the vehicle cool (virtually a year-round necessity in So. Florida) I had to keep the fan on high or the air flow disappeared somewhere into the dash.  Then the defrosters went the other way, low fan speed only or they too disappeared somewhere other than where intended.  Other problems include upholstery that won't stay affixed to the armrests and a dome light that only occasionally works when the rear hatch is opened.

On the plus side though, it has been very dependable.  It always starts up first crank (excluding the aforementioned gas guage issue) and runs smoothly.  Ride is really very good considering the lack of independent suspension both front and rear.  Fuel economy could be a bit better, as 20 mpg is the norm for highway driving, and speed or A/C use seems to have little or no impact.

All in all?  I'd say it ranks up there as a solid vehicle and more than competative when price is factored in.  But I do feel the vehicle is over rated, and doesn't live up to it's reputation.  It is not my first &quot;Sport Ute&quot;, and probably won't be my last, but I will need to see a lot more attention to detail before I buy another Jeep.<br><br>
