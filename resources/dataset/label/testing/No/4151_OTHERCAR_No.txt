            We bought a used 1995 Isuzu Rodeo from a reputable dealer.  Consumers Buyer Guide Magazine even rated this vehicle as an excellent second hand SUV. I beg to differ!  We had this SUV two weeks and the transmission blew all of its transmissions fluid out when the engine heated.  (The authorized dealership claims that these vehicles are almost maintenance free!) 
I have found others in my immediate community experiencing this very same problem!  I write to warn anyone even considering purchasing a 1995 Isuzu Rodeo to know that this year of the isuzu rodeo has real problems with its transmission and it is very expensive to repair, not to mention THEY DO NOT GUARANTEE AFTER THE REPAIR, THAT IT WILL FIX THE PROBLEM!  If anyone reading this is experiencing this same type problem, please contact an Authorized Dealership for Isuzu products, to get your problem noted and established with them. 
I do NOT recommend this car to anyone and in fact after this experience I will never buy another Isuzu product!!  This problem I feel is a defect and one Isuzu should Recall for repairs on all the vehicles, especially since their own Authorized Dealerships won't or can't guarantee repairing the problem will fix it!! 
We own six vehicles in this family and this is the first and the last Isuzu product we will ever buy. As for how this vehicle drives, we haven't had much of an opportunity to be able to give that opinion as it has been in the in the repair shop the majority of our ownership.  Honestly, PLEASE BE WARE OF THE 1995 RODEO!!!!!!!!!!!!    <br><br>
