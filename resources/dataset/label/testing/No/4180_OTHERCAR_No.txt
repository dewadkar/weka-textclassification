            When I found out I was pregnant with twins in 1996 my first thought was, well, I guess I'm not going to be able to drive this convertible Mustang anymore!  Despite protests from my husband, we bought a 1996 Dodge Caravan SE.

The Caravan is very nice looking, both inside and out.  Ours is dark green with a grey interior.  We have dual sliding doors and captains chairs in the middle.  Some of the nicer features are the variety of ways you can fold down (or remove) the seats to create more cargo space, the number of cup holders, and the comfort of the vehicle.  That's the good news.

The bad news is that once it hit about 3 years old and 50,000 miles, we've had nothing but trouble with it.  It just hit 70,000 miles last week and the headaches are too great to number.  It started two years ago when we went in for a brake job and ended up having to replace the entire brake assembly -- for over $600.  In the past six months we have replaced the water pump, the alternator, and the expensive serpentine belt TWICE.  The air conditioning system went out a few months ago and we haven't even had the money to replace that yet.  Oh, and we've had continual problems with the brakes.

We are very good to our cars and have performed all the regular upkeep on this one.  Our mechanic (and believe me, we've taken it to a few for second and third opinions) tell us to ditch this lemon.  His prediction is that the transmission is about to go.  So now we don't even have a car we can rely on for longer trips anymore.

The Caravan also seems excessively noisy -- it's hard to carry on conversations with people from the front seat to the middle seat, nevermind all the way to the back seat.

I've heard it's best to avoid the first year of a new car model, and the '96 was the year the Caravan was re-designed from its previous boxier style.  If you're looking for a Caravan, we have friends with a '98 and they love it.  However, we're feeling a little leery about Dodge products after our bad experience with the Caravan, and will probably be looking for an import.<br><br>
