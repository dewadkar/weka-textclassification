            I bought this vehicle with 93,000 miles on it, and it is still running and driving like it was when i got it now at 150,000 miles.Ive gone through a slew of minor and major fixes throughout the 3 yrs that ive owned it.Ill start with the good things about this vehicle. The Vortech CPI high performance engine with automatic transmission puts out 200  horsepower an 260lb of torque. That translates into excellent low speed torque and power. I got about 10 more horses with a k&n filter kit and electric fan which i recommend getting.The push button shift on the fly 4x4 system is excellent in snow and mud.Has lots of head and leg room in all seating locations especially in back seats.Fold down back seat comes in handy for extra storage and makes a nice bed.Now the bad stuff.EGR valve gets clogged up occasionly with carbon causing the truck to stall and run rough. Not really that big of a deal cause easy to remove and clean.There is acually a screen that they make to block any carbon chunks from getting in there.The fuel injection system is prone to leakage no matter what the mileage on the truck  but especially around 100000 miles they will begin to go.Had mine leak twice. Part gos for about $250 with about $100 for labor, unless your handy enough to tackle the job yourself. The fuel lines that feed into the injector also get brittle and leak.Had lower ball joints replaced,alternator,power window motor,brake booster, 4x4 acuator hose,muffler and tailpipe. Did alternator and pw motor myself so ran about $200 for the parts.Had a buddy do the ball joints for 2 and a quarter.Torsion bar mounts break causing a popping noise when turning and going over bumps.Part and labor about $100 ive been quoted, might do the job myself.Fuel ecomomy suffers a bit, i get about 15 around the city and 20 on the highway.All and all , unless your lucky and  you get a blazer that was made by God, your gonna be putting money into it whether you like it or not.The engine and transmission will last while but your gonna go through hell just keeping it running right.
