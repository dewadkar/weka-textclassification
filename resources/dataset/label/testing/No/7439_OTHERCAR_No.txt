            I've always had a particular fondness for Grand Am's, so I couldn't pass up a great deal on a 2000 GT at a dealer nearby.  Used, but very low miles.

I'll get the negatives out of the way.
My last car was a '95 Grand Am SE, and one very annoying issue was warping brake rotors.  A $600 job that could recur in as little as 5-10 thousand miles.  I'm an unfortunate repeat-witness to this.

I've had a couple mechanical issues that turned out to be quite common, as well, including needing a resistor replacement to get settings 1 and 2 of the AC to work, and the seat raising mechanism being shot.

It's not as fast as the exterior and interior cosmetics (or some reviews here..?) would have you believe.  It feels like a typical 6 cylinder car.  The dashboard's got a nice sporty look, which can border on tacky and cheap.  I personally like the interior and exterior, but I can see how to attempt as looking sporty without enough substance to back it all up may turn some off, especially the overstuffed steering wheel.
But I like it all, what can I say.

I just like to get the bad stuff behind me.

It's great for what it really is.  A car with nice features and great looks, for a great price.  There's a reason it sells so darned well.

While it's indeed not a sports car, it does provide enough power when the light turns green, and more importanly when you wanna merge or pass in traffic.  It may not be as fast as it looks, but it's more than fast enough.  And in my opinion it's just more fun to look at than the typical-looking competitors in its class.

The ride is a nice one for its size and class.  The GT's stiffer suspension has me wishing I'd opted for an SE half the time, glad that I got the GT the other half of the times, in daily driving.
Though the car's no sports car, there is more than adequate power that you'll feel should you put the pedal down hard whether you'r starting off the line or need acceleration during highway driving.  Acceleration climbs smoothly and evenly on the highway.  The steering is superb.  Turns are smooth and ultra sharp.  With the decent power of the car, it can make for some fun driving.  3 point turns?  Rarely necessary.  Braking is more than adequate.  It almost makes the thought of parking lot driving fun.

On the inside, it's adequately comfortable, and an overall nice dashboard design.  I like the look, as it comes up high and close, but others, like my gf, may find that it makes for an unnecessarily claustrophobic experience.  The rear seats do the job adequately, but you'll wanna leave the basketball team behind.  The AC is powerful.  Summer's got nothing on the car's AC.  Among the strongest I've felt in cars, much like my last Grand Am.  A mobile refridgerator.  A pneumonia machine.  A freon bath.  I mean all that in a good way.  The standard Delco CD stereo's adequate, perhaps a bit too bassy.  Radio static seems to be noticeable, maybe it's lacking Dolby Noice Reduction.  I noticed this in two other GT's I test drove.

My best argument for my liking the Grand Am's is uniqueness.
The car just stands out from other samey or boring cars like the Chevys, Toyotas and Hondas of similar classes.
From the wavy exterior down to the bright red dashboard lights, it just makes for something that feels different, and keeps an owner aware of the fondness that drove him to purchase it.

It's got some mechanical annoyances, but in the big picture it's a pretty reliable car, from my experience.  Not quite as well made as the Nissan Maxima I also share with my girlfriend, but not bad for an American car.

Would I instantly recommend this car to a friend?  No.
Would I buy another?  Yes.
My priority is a reasonable level of quality and a car that's fun to drive and look at.  It's a practical car that lets those who can't or shouldn't own a sports car have a bit of fun as well.
