            I just recently bought a 1992 Honda Accord.  It is the perfect car for my needs.  It has four doors and is the EX model, with a standard transmission.  the shifting is smooth and solid, i haven't missed a gear yet.

  It is spacious enough to fit five good sized people inside.  However, this does not mean that you can't fit more people in.  One time in a pinch, i fit 6 people inside including myself.  I am 6'1&quot; 200lbs.  Riding shotgun was an old offensive lineman who is 6'4&quot; and weighed in at just under 330lbs. In the back were three guys all around 5'9&quot;  but who all had substantial guts that brought their weight up to around 215 each.  The last guy was a pretty scrawny 175.  The route we drove was no picnic either, you see, we worked halfway up on the side of 14411ft Mt. Rainier.  The drive to and from the mountain is steep and curvy.  The suspension was beefy enough to handle all of the turns, and the motor was powerful enough to get us back up without a problem.  <br><br>
