            We bought our 98 Neon a year ago and I have to say we are basically happy with our choice. We bought the car because we needed an economical car. I believe we did get that. To gain it we made sacrifices.

The things we have found we like about the Neon are the good gas mileage, it is much roomier on the inside then it looks, and is fairly easy to parallel park. My husband feels it is quick and responsive.

We do not like the fact that it does not have fully enclosed door frames. This means there is a lot of road noise. On the highways this gets really annoying. The transmission does not shift smoothly.

We have had it in the shop in the shop four times in the last year for various reason. There seems to have been usual wear to the rotors. Turn signal had broken. We also had a problem with the car shimmying after it reached 50 mph. They needed to fix something in the suspension. Fortunately it is under warrantee. 

We will be looking for another vehicle soon. I think we would have to really think about whether or not we would buy another Neon.<br><br>
