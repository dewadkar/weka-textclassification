            On April 30th, 1999 I bought a brand new Honda Civic LX. I chose to buy this car because Hondas have a reputation for endurance and longevity. I have put 15,000 miles on it in the past 6 mos. The Civic may last forever, unfortunately by this time next year it will have a new home. I am not very happy with this vehicle. It drives great, but I have yet to see this remarkable gas mileage it is reputed to have. Many of these 15k miles were spent extremely uncomfortably. The seats are very hard. On long trips I have to get out and walk out the cramps every 2-3 hrs. This problem is not due to old age as I am only 25. I am not a large person... I weigh in at about 125 lbs. And I am not overly particular. Not only is the Civic uncomfortable and gets terrible gas mileage (I rarely speed and do not drive in stop and go traffic), but I have to take it in because there is a problem with the power locks...My old 1992 Nissan still unlocks w/ no problem and still gets 39/40 mpg.(my hubby drives the old car.) One of the great things about the Honda is that it zips in and out of traffic and it is highly dependable, and it looks good. I have also figured out that by this time next year I will owe wholesale book on the Civic and I can trade it in for something more comfortable...like a Buick Regal GS with a supercharged engine. Or a Mercury Sable. I have decided that cute trendy cars are not me... I want comfort!!!<br><br>
