                We got a 1998 Plymouth Breeze a little over a year ago.  It's not a bad car. It only has around 70,000km on it, but we haven't had any problems with it yet.
    
 It doesn't look too bad, but I think the Stratus looks a bit better. The inside looks nice, the dash is a dark grey almost black colour, and the dash lights are all orange making it look really cool.

    The front seats are comfortable, but the back ones aren't that good. It has lots of room inside for the size. The trunk has quite a bit of space in it and the back seat folds down for more space. 

   The stereo is pretty good for a factory unit in a low price car, but ours doesn't have a cd player. It works fine with a car adaptor and a discman though. 

  Ours has a 2.4L engine and it's got a lot of power at all speeds and it will burn some rubber. Don't get the 2.0L engine it doesn't have enough power. The handling is really good and the ride is still pretty smooth but not as smooth as some vehicles like a Ford Windstar for example, but thats because the suspension is a lot stiffer on the Breeze. 
   This wouldn't be my choice for a car, but my parents bought it and they like it a lot. <br><br>
