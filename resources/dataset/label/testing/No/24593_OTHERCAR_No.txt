            I currently own 2 Toyota's, 1995 Supra Turbo &amp; a 1993 Camry SE.  I've been a 26-year customer of Toyota, personally owning 7 of their cars.

I'm currently having a major problem with Toyota as to how they treat customers.  I had a blown engine in the Supra at 43,000 miles.  A repair shop purchased a brand new short block directly from Toyota.  During the new engine break-in period, 98.4 miles to be exact, the engine blew up.  The cause, a fault in Toyota's manufacturing of the new engine.  How do we know this?  The connected rod bolt cap (nut) came loose causing the connecting rod to blast a hole through the new engine block.

Toyota claims that it's now their fault.  I can't figure out how it's my repair shop's fault as they're not supposed to touch the internal components during re-assembly.

Anyway, I'm incredibly ticked off at Toyota, and if they don't reverse their decision and give my repair shop a new short block, I've then purchased my last Toyota of my lifetime.<br><br>
