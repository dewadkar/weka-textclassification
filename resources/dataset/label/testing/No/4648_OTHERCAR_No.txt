            This review is based on a '96 Z24 Cavalier, but the car has changed very little since then so most of the points here are probably still valid.

Shortly after we got married my wife and I bought a Z24 mainly for her use.  We wanted something sporty but able to comfortably carry passengers, and at the time the Cavalier and Sunfire seemed like the best deal for the money.

The 150HP engine is enough to move this fairly light car pretty well, and its 2.4 liters (vs typically smaller, higher-revving engines in the competition's cars) meant a decent amount of low-end torque.  The stock 16&quot; wheels &amp; tires have proved reliable in various sorts of weather, and the suspension is firm enough to do some aggressive cornering without turning bone-jarring on bumpy roads.  The chassis isn't what I'd call wonderful - there's definitely some flex going on - but it's a big improvement over the Escort I drove for a few years.

Space is well used - back seats are usable, if not a lot of fun for adults, and that's more than most other cars in this price range can claim.  A glove compartment that's genuinely functional - able to hold much more than a spare pen and an insurance card - is a nice, and uncommon, feature.  The front seats are nothing special - basic economy-car seating that's fairly comfortable to sit on for short periods, but plan on a lot of squirming on long trips.

As it turned out, my wife started having some hip problems (followed by pregnancy and stay-at-home motherhood), so the Cav hasn't gotten used too much - five years later, it's only got about 13,000 miles on it.  I've done the basic maintenance myself - checking fluids &amp; changing oil, etc., so it hasn't cost us much at all from that perspective.

After less than 3000 miles, though, we had a complete failure of the weatherstripping; the dealer had to replace _all_ of it after my wife found water almost up to the door sills after a heavy rain.  Fortunately it hadn't reached the seats.

By about 5000 miles, squeaking had started, rattling at 8000 or so, and these days there's an occasional loud &quot;sproing&quot; or &quot;thud&quot; noise from the rear suspension, even though everything there looks fine.

Chevy's big ad campaign for the Cavalier a few years back focused on its saftey features - air bags, ABS, etc.  What they didn't tell you (or me - the data was released after I bought it) is that in a comparison of compact cars in crash tests, it was far and away the absolute _worst_, offering virtually no protection to the driver or front passenger in such impacts.  Side impact bars have been added on newer models, but this sounds to me like slapping on a band-aid to cover what is essentially a chassis/frame problem.

Another thing they don't tell you is that while those brakes do have ABS, that's about all they've got going for them.  They're small discs in front and drums in the rear; get a couple of passengers or some cargo in the car, and you'd better plan for a very long stopping distance even under good conditions.  And don't stop too often if you can help it - they fade fast.

I think the ideal compact car in the $15-17K price range would come about if Ford could put a little more power under the hood of the focus, or if GM could build a Focus-like chassis to wrap around the Cav's Quad 4 engine.  In the meantime, though, the Cavalier is in need of better brakes, better impact protection, and better quality materials.
