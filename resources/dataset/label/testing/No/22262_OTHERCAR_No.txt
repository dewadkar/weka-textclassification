            Back for more!  Ok here is the nits and grits.  

The V70 AWD is a totally different car than its predecessor.  The platform is based on the S80, as will be the replacement for the S70 but they are not going to call it the S70, it will be the S60. 

The biggest differences moving forward appear to be a more civil ride, a more rigid body, quieter engine, and more cargo and passenger area.  Volvo has redesigned their turbo five cylinder engines to reduce some of the weight and allow it to run more efficiently, but this car is actually heavier than the S80 by 100 pounds and has a smaller engine.  Fuel economy is rated at 22 highway mpg. On the road this car behaves more an SUV, and sounds like it as well with the &quot;Scorpion&quot; LT Pirelli.  That is not to say that it is bad but it isn't quite what I would expect.  There is virtually no noticeable torque steer as there really is not enough thrust to propel you to 60 in mid single digits.  I drove this car exclusively without cargo, so I would imagine that adding weight could affect the propulsion, but would no doubt improve the ride.  It was hard not to notice the buffeting effects of the winds as well as the noise created by the wind and I might mention that the tires were also noisier so I turned up the radio and that was excellent, big improvement over their previous XC model.

The transmission is essentially the same as the previous model with the &quot;geartronic&quot; addition. What the geartronic does is to allow the driver to manually select shift points but where this gets sticky is when you are in geartronic mode the driver has to downshift as well.  In the T6 S80s with geartronic we saw some transmission failures from people waiting too long to down shift causing clutch failure. (If I sound leary I am getting through) Driving the car in geartronic mode may lead so a shorter life expectancy of the transmission.  The cars that I have driven shifted smoothly in geartronic mode but when in  &quot;D&quot; and pushed hard their seems to be some gulps and gasps before finally deciding to get going and the shift between gears under acceleration seemed harsh.

Transmission leads us to differential, drive shafts, and final drive and this also has been redesigned, as has the viscous coupler.  The gearing is structured to create less force against the transmission and drive axles netting the driver a smoother ride, and this is good. The viscous coupler is now wider and shorter with a claimed better distribution of power and less clutch wear.  The tires are also up from 15&quot; to a 16&quot; and this is a tire designed for a light truck, Pirelli Scorpion.  Volvo retails this tire for around 230.00 but you can get this same tire at www.tirerack.com and they can sell it to you for around $85.00 a copy with shipping.  This is a big plus.  The tires used for the previous XC models did not stand up well to the extra friction caused by the AWD system. (See my review on the Continental CH95)

The promotional material points out this vehicle's aerodynamic improvements, .30cd, so now you can drive a sculpted brick.  But freally, this is not a bad exterior design, if you take away the big plastic, last minute looking, add-ons.  Incorporated into both front and rear bumpers are beefier sections that are somewhat reminiscent of a tug boat, but if you look closely you will see that this is color matched plastic which can save thousands at the body shop in the event of scrapes and bruises and it should retain its shape better than the previous models bumper coverings.  Dings and bruises can be removed by careful use of a heat gun.  Visually, the car from the frontal view looks like it is ready for the Paris-Dakar rally but the rest of the vehicle says &quot;we can finish this later&quot;. On the underside the car has not skid plating and in the rear suspension where there used to be alloy cast suspension arms there are Steel stamped pieces, which is less expensive and less durable than the former cast alloy set up.  (cost reduction?)

Here is a big plus right from Sweden, the interior is made of 85% recyclable materials, so stop by your nearby recycler soon. Apparently this is a law now.  The trim is friendly inside but I can't help but think that the metal bar in the center console says, &quot;handcuffs attach here&quot;.  The seats are roomy and comfortable and even the biggest of drivers  (yes you too, &quot;Big Bertha&quot;) will have room to stretch.  (&quot;Big Bertha&quot; is a golf club that is a designated driver). One nice feature for those of us who let things ride around on the dash is that the defroster ports have grills, like speaker covers, over them so no more lost tickets or favorite pens.

Owners of older 850&amp; S/V70 models could turn their own daytime running lights off now it has to be done by people like me who send satellite messages off to some unknown region of the galaxy. After a light year or two, when the new software comes back you start getting annoying spam in the message center of your dash from MSN.  This is because we use a windows NT platform.  
(Ok I couldn't resist}

Oh I think you will love this, it is healthier to drive due to the radiator having a special coating on it which acts as a catalytic converter.  The ozone that is out there is converted to oxygen so the car and occupants get cleaner air.  And this is not all the car has an interior air quality monitoring system, available as an option.  

SRS system has a dual stage air bag for both driver and passenger which is driven by two igniters and is deployed based on the severity of the crash.

Here is what is really hairy, all the cars electronics are linked by a network and when these systems were first introduced it was a comedy of errors.  If you have a newer Volvo already you have no doubt experienced some network problems.  These systems are software driven and are not friendly to plug and play devices like even phones.  The few that we have delivered have all been back for minor problems but a car costing this kind of change should be a finished product. I can not stress enough the importance of bringing this car to your dealer for any upgrades or accessories, but that does not include handbags, go ahead and change those any time you like.
