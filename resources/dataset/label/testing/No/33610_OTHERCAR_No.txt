            I leased this car because I have always dreamt about owning a Porsche.  Now it has been a reality for the last 15 months.  I have a 1999 Boxster (manual).

The car has been truly amazing to drive - when it works.  I seem to be one of the unfortunate ones that has had a lot of trouble with the car.  Judging from some of the reviews, most people love the car.  Take a look around at some of the Porsche boards and you'll find that other people have had mechanical trouble with the car also.

In the first 9 months of ownership, the car has been on a flatbed 3 times - each time for a different reason.  The first time, the engine seized at around 2000 miles.  A new engine was put in and the warranty extended by Porsche.  The second time, a shift linkage cable came off.  The third time, a CV joint broke pulling out of a parking lot.  I have also had the front struts replaced (only happens if you drive hard) and the stereo replaced.  See my web site for more info.  I have a diary there: http://www.yeohbaby.com.  since then, the car has run without any mechanical failure.

Back to driving this vehicle.  I just starting autocrossing and the car's handling is nothing short of amazing.  As a novice, I found myself beating experienced drivers on race tires in cars like the 300ZX or a Vette.  Very very cool.  I have also beaten 911's on R1's.

Because of the problems with this car, I'm trading the car in later this year for a 2000 Boxster.  Yes, despite the problems, I love driving this car and am not prepared to give up the Boxster because of mechanical problems.

I also started learning how to golf last year and found that I could not fit a golf bag in the trunk.  Anybody have any suggestions?

Besides recommending that you buy the car, my primary caution would be the dealer, make sure they will take good care of you.  Mine has not always been the most responsive.  If I get a return call, I'm lucky.<br><br>
