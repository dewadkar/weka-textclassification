            I bought this digital camera only because I got a great deal for it. I knew I shouldn't expect a great camera since it was 1.3 megapixels and had only 2x zoom. 
<P>
The camera has a 1.5" LCD screen, two buttons (power on/off and playback view) and a scroll button (to toggle between resolution, flash, and zoom levels). The auto-flash camera comes with 4 AA batteries, a 4 Mb memory card and a USB cord to transfer the pictures to your PC. The software included is Photo Impression 2000. 
<P>
<b>Cons:</b><BR>
The included memory card holds very few pictures: 10 at highest resolution, 19 at mid-res, and 36 at low-res. Don't expect to be taking professional quality pictures with this camera. The pictures are very pixelated at low-res, and still are not very clear at high resolution. The pictures are stored as JPEG files. <BR>
Another aspect I did not particularly like was that it uses only non-rechargeable AA batteries, which can get to be pretty pricey to maintain. I don't know why they don't recommend rechargeable batteries, but it's a pain to have to carry a ton of batteries around! Also, you can purchase a 6V AC adapter (for the low low price of *only* $30! sheesh) if you absolutely cannot stand draining your batteries, of course, this cuts your mobility down drastically since you have to find an outlet to plug into. The only pro of getting the adapter would be for powering the camera during picture transfer (during which requires the camera to be ON).<BR>
Which brings me to my next rant, the fact that no matter what you do with the camera, the batteries are getting drained with every passing second. I personally don't like the CompactFlash photo cards because unless you have a separate photo card reader (like the SanDisk ImageMate USB), you are going to have to keep your camera on just to transfer the pictures. The other type of photo card (not compatible with this camera) is the SmartMedia card, which is smaller than a book of matches and about as thick as a credit card. I prefer this card because it usually comes with a 3.5" floppy adapter disk, which acts just like a typical floppy. Much easier to use, so I recommend looking for a camera with this type of memory or better (like Sony Mavica's 3.5" floppy or CD-RW technology).
<BR>
Aesthetically, this camera is quite large and bulky. It is simple and not cluttered with a ton of buttons but seems too large for what little features it offers. I actually find myself taking my regular 35mm camera over the digicam just because I don't want to carry around a monster of a camera. Kind of defeats the purpose of getting a digital camera right?
<P>
<b>Pros:</b><br>
This is a very easy-to-use basic camera. Perfect for someone not interested in taking professional-picture-quality shots (like for college kid needing an easy way to upload pictures to a website, or for keeping photo records of things). It's pretty much a no-brainer to figure out how to work this thing.
