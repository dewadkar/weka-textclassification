            I bought this camera well over 2 years ago and still use it to take photos of odd stuff.  The 640x480 is obviously limiting in this day and age, but I'm not even sure that this camera can still be purchased.

The really nice thing that Sony has done with the Mavica line revolves around the photo storage device:  a floppy drive.  This really works for me.  Floppy disks are a dime a dozen (literally) and they're easily read by my computer.  I didn't need to buy an additional card reader or any of that extraneous stuff you need with a lot of cameras these days.<br><br>
