            When I unwrapped my Fuji 6800 Digital, I thought it would be the most amazing camera I had ever owned.  Maybe my expectations were too high, because this camera was a bit of a disappointment. 

The small, sleek body is modern and attractive, but since a camera is for play and not ornamentation, I am finding the design to be burdensome. I am still not comfortable with the size: my fingers are always getting in the way of the LCD panel. I should mention that before the Fuji 6800 I was using a 35mm Pentax water resistant zoom camera. It took great photos and cost about $150 in 1998. I never felt as if I had to hold it delicately, rock it, nor rest it in it's cradle at night like the 6800. I could throw that baby in a drawer and it was never temperamental. 

The color in the 6800's photos is brilliant and beautiful, as is the detail in range of up to about twenty feet away. However, I've found that this camera is not for long distances. I took it to my husband's university graduation and could not get one decent photo, whereas I would have been able to get great pics with my old Pentax.  It was very disappointing. 

Although I like using the display panel, the battery wears down quickly and the camera's speed slows.  I've lost some great shots of my one-year-old son as a result of this. 

Overall, the Fuji 6800 takes great photos if you're looking for color and detail at a close range.  However, I would rather have all of the features this little camera carries on a computer so that the battery does not wear down so easily, since it makes me feel rushed and photography unenjoyable.  I'm a fairly low-tech kind of gal and was hoping that this camera would simplify photography while ensuring better results. I guess that even in the technological era you get what you give.  Therefore, I have mixed feelings about the Fuji 6800, but would recommend that anyone looking for a good digital camera find something less pretty and more practical.
