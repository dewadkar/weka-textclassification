            Toyota's reputation for reliability draws me into their showrooms, but they really need more than just one card to beat what other dealers have in their hands. For the full-size truck market in the 2003 model year, I'm afraid Toyota is just coming up as the big loser with their mediocre but highly priced Tundra.

I'm in the market for a full-size truck this year, and I've been trying to spend a little time with each of the models on the market to see which ones I like the best, and which ones offer the best bang for the buck. I spent the past couple days with a demo Tundra (a 2-wheel drive extended cab with automatic transmission and V8 engine), but after only about 200 miles, I'm bringing this truck back because it's really not tripping my trigger. Not in the least. 

Here's how I see the vehicle stacking up against this year's competition...

<b>Cab Design / Configuration</b>
Time was when a pickup was a pickup. 

That all started to change about 20 years ago when extended cabs burst on the scene, and it changed even more radically a scant handful of years ago when true 4-door quad cabs started rolling out in big numbers on consumer-oriented models. Heck, I'll bet Nissan sells more Frontier crew cabs today than standard cabs!

Today, the only major pickup manufacturer without a real crew cab configuration is Toyota. That omission looks like a gaping gulf to a buyer like me who really wants a <i>big</i> truck -- not just a compact truck on steroids, which is increasingly how Tundra is looking to me. For 2003, Tundra is <i>still</i> available only in standard cab and extended cab (called Access Cab in Toyota marketing-speak). 

Rear doors exist on the extended cab, but they are so badly designed that they are essentially useless. They work like the "suicide doors" on Lincolns from the late 1950s. Doors that face into each other was a dumb idea back in the 1959, as Lincoln soon found out. It's an even dumber idea in 2003 when humans should have achieved enough intelligence to not repeat the mistakes of our forefathers, or at least our fore-automotive engineers.

Only with the front door almost completely open can the rear door open enough to let someone into the back seat. That rules out using the door in parking lots or anywhere you might park near a wall, tree, or whatever. 

If you have <i>any</i> intention of <i>ever</i> using the back seat to carry passengers or even groceries, think twice before buying the Tundra extended cab. Then think a few more times. Then if you haven't ruled out Tundra, think yet again. With all the genuine crew cabs available on the market today, with genuinely usable doors that swing open correctly, there is just no reason for anyone to have to put up with the bad design of this extended cab.

<b>Comfort and Space...</b>
I hate to be brutal to a company that I generally like, but this Tundra seems to me to be the least attractive, least functionally useful interior space of any full-size truck on the market today.

As you step into the truck, you can't help but notice that the cab feels tighter and less spacious than cabs on other full-size trucks. While the leg room and headspace in the front seat is generally acceptable, the back seat is significantly less spacious with less usable space than competing vehicles. The hip space on the back seat is 56.6 inches on Tundra. Some pickups have as much as 10 inches more space on that seat -- a significant difference! Compare the specs on rear height and leg room and you'll find similarly tighter specs on Toyota than on any other full size cab.

This is not mere conjecture. Toyota <i>does</i> have a smaller cab than competitors. I can feel it just climbing in, but the numbers are there to back it up. By the way, if you feel like checking up on me and keeping me honest, the numbers are on the web at:
www.toyota.com/html/shop/vehicles/tundra/specs/tundra_specs.html

The front seat has plenty of room and the controls on the drivers side power seat are easy to reach and use. I liked that the instrument panel was clean and uncluttered with analog gauges and not a lot of Mickey Mouse contraptions of dubious utility. It reminded me a lot of the dashboard that I had on my 1989 Toyota pickup -- just a bit stretched out, but most controls are in the same places now as Toyota had them 10 years ago...

I liked the in-dash CD player, but like most manufacturer sound systems, it was underpowered and started to sound muddy as soon as the slightest volume was turned up. 

The back seat was impossibly tight and completely unusable when the front seats were in their back position, but with all the front leg room, it was easy to find a position where normal adults could compromise with some comfort for both front and rear passengers. Back seats of extended cab pickups aren't usually real comfortable places to be, but I must say that the rear seat in this Tundra was fairly comfortable with plenty of padding and support. 

Comparatively, Tundra is the least comfortable cab in today's full-size truck market, although I still don't think it's too bad. I much preferred the comfort and greater spaciousness of the Ford F-150 to this Tundra.

<b>Power and Performance...</b>
For most buyers' purposes, the Toyota Tundra posts some fairly impressive performance numbers.  

With a payload capacity of 1,800 pounds (my mother-in-law could even ride with me) and a towing capacity of 7,200 pounds (my sister-in-law might want to come too), the Tundra has more than enough brute power for most weekend projects or outdoor adventures. Tundra comes with either a 190 horsepower 3.4 litre V6 or a 240 horsepower 4.7 litre V8 engine. The V6 is a bit sluggish, but the V8 is a capable performer. Toyota's truck engines seem optimized a bit more for empty highway driving than for heavy cargo pulling. As a result, the Tundra is a bit more responsive on acceleration than most other full size trucks. (Not that people buy trucks for racing, but nobody wants to be at the back of the pack.) The flip side, of course, is that this is going to be a wimpier truck than domestic trucks if what you really need is power when the truck is loaded down. Tundra might be okay for a soccer mom, but probably not a great choice for a true work truck.

16 inch wheels are standard on most Tundras, though you can get 17 inch wheels on some models (I believe it may be part of their TRD sport package). If you're a "bigger is better" kind of truck buyer, these numbers won't impress you -- not in an era when Dodge is offering 20 inch wheels on some of their Ram 1500s. 

Size-wise, Toyota is shorter, narrower, and generally all-around smaller than any U.S. built full-size truck. There are plenty of people who might be glad that it's easier to climb into a Tundra than it is a big Dodge Ram, but the flip side is that things generally feel thinner, lighter, and less substantial on the Tundra than they do on American full-size trucks. Doors clink shut when they should they THUNK. The hood drops with tinny clank instead of an earth-shaking WHACK. The doors look like they're about 3 or 4 inches thick while the doors on a Ford F-150 are probably 50 percent thicker and heavier.

Some of this perception, no doubt, because the Tundra is actually a fairly heavy vehicle with a curb weight of 4,160 on the V6 or 4,450 on the V8. Ford, Chevy, and Dodge are all heavier -- but not by huge numbers.

<b>Pricing and Value...</b>
Toyota prices the Tundra fairly high for what you get (Access cabs usually run from about $25,000 to $31,000) and incentives are less enticing than those currently being offerred by domestic truck makers. As a result, the Tundra Access Cab will cost a buyer as much as a genuine 4-door Quad Cab/Crew Cab from Ford, Dodge, or Chevy. Compared to domestic extended cab models, the Toyota marquee is adding $5,000 to $10,000 to the price tag. 

The resale value of a Tundra might well be as good as Toyota claims, but you are going to have to own it quite a long time to make up for the higher purchase price, higher up-front costs, plus the significantly higher financing costs. (Toyota is offerring a 0 percent financing incentive, but it's capped at 36 months, not 60 months as GM and Ford are doing -- can <i>you</i> afford a $1,000 monthly car payment??).

Toyota's warranty is less enticing than those of many other car companies today. Their A bumper-to-bumper 36 month, 36,000 mile with 60,000 mile powertrain warranty is fairly good, but it is still less coverage than you could get with some of the 100,000 mile warranties floating around today (look at Dodge and some of the Korean car companies for some of today's longest warranty terms).

<b>Bottom Line...</b>
I'm really not impressed by the Tundra. Aside from being backed up by Toyota's reputation for building durable vehicles, this truck really doesn't have a lot going for it compared to other full size trucks (or even compact trucks) being sold in the U.S. today. 

Toyota seems to be standing still at the starting line with the only lineup without a true 4-door cab. 

While the overall capacity of this truck is competitive with full-size trucks, the  appearance and feel of Tundra is too much like a compact truck to be taken seriously. Toyota's design looks dated and unappealing compared to the burly, aggressive styling of Dodge and Ford -- and now for 2003  Chevrolet is rolling out a new look on their Silverados with a front end borrowed from their popular Avalanche trucks.  

I have a generally positive image of most Toyota vehicles, but this Tundra just doesn't do it for me. Toyota really needs to rethink the design of this truck. They need a true 4-door cab, a beefier look and feel, and they need competitive pricing and incentives. 

In my opinion, I really can't recommend Tundra for any full-size truck buyers. It's just not much truck for the money. Of the four major players for the full-size truck market, Tundra is -- by far -- at the back of the pack. 

By all means, give it a test drive and check it out for yourself. Just be prepared to be underwhelmed if you've recently driven new full-size Fords, Chevies, and Dodges. I'm sure underwhelmed.  

Until next time, see you on the road. I'll probably be test-driving more new full size trucks, so <i>watch out, folks, here I come!</i>
