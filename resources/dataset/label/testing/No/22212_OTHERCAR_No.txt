            There are many things I like about this car. Good power, comfortable seats, nice stereo, and good climate control are among them. I was impressed when my wife and I test drove it (by ourselves). 

It wasn't until a couple of weeks later that we went for a drive with both of our teenagers. We then realized how grossly inadequate the rear suspension is. With a normal load of 4 adult-sized passengers (and no luggage) the rear suspension is completely bottomed-out on the rubber stops. This means that for all practical purposes, there's no suspension at all. Every bump is a terrible jolt, and it's like riding in a lumber wagon.

We bought this car to use as an alternative to our family car, a GMC Envoy. Unfortunately, it's impossible to go anywhere as a family in the this car because of the horrible ride with a moderate load. It's OK for me to drive to work, but a cheap economy car would have worked for that purpose. 

I urge anyone considering this vehicle to test drive it with more people in the car and make sure you can live with the ride. 

At this point, the dealership (Jim Lupient Isuzu in Minneapolis) has done nothing to help us other than tell us there's nothing wrong with the car in the sense that nothing is broken. It's not broken-- it's a defective design with very weak springs and very limited suspension travel. Isuzu says there's nothing they can do, because the car is within design specs, and that's just how they are. All it would take are slightly taller, stiffer springs, but there's no fix available. 

I've owned many new cars over the past 25 years, and I've never been as unhappy with any of them as I am with this one. It has many nice features, but this one faulty design feature makes it unusable as we intended to use it.
