            I bought this car (sedan version) used and was very, very disappointed with its lack of reliability.

The main problem is the transmission. It seems Ford didn't do a very good job of building the Taurus/Sable transmission and that they fall apart after a mere 75,000 miles.

In case you don't know, transmission rebuilds are expensive; you can expect to pay between $700 and $2000 depending on how much the mechanic thinks he can get away with. I would not recommend paying more than $1500 for a transmission build, and make sure you get a _national_ warranty because your new transmission will break and you don't want to have to pay to replace that one too.

If you don't mind have a car that may or may not get from Point A to Point B on any given day, then there are some nice perks to owning a late 1980s/early 1990s Mercury Sable. The stereo's good, seats are comfy, the interior is spacious, and the ride is fairly smooth.

Bottom Line: Don't make the same mistake I did. When you buy this car, tack on $2000 to the price for repairs. Nobody thinks the car will last much over 100,000 miles.<br><br>
