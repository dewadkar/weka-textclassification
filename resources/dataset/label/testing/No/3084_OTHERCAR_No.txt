            We purchased this vehicle because of price, gas mileage and room.
We love almost everything about this car.  This is the finest car I have ever owned except for one problem.
The car is great to drive.  Does not have the road feeling of a sports car, but then it is a larger car.
Anyone who buys this vehicle would be happy if the bugs are worked out.  Brake Master cylinder went out after a week.  Rear Main seal went out twice.  Delamination of the dash happen once.  This are things that I can accept.  We have had problems with wind noise.  Don't buy this vehicle if you live in temperatures over 89 degrees with winds.  We are not able to drive this car above speeds of 60 MPH with high winds.  GM will not admit to the problem even though we know of Technical Service Bulletins.  We were told today that Park Avenues are having simular problems.  The dealer with the help of GM made two attempts to fix this problem.  In each case the fix made the problem worse.  The first time the problem was notice was at speeds of 70 MPH at 95 degrees.  After the second fix, the car has the problem as 65 MPH at 89 degrees.  We have had this problem for three years.  The factory rep. tried to blame this on the sun roof.  After informing him that his car was driven off the showroom floor he was eating crow.  We would like to know if anyone else has had simular problems.
