            I purchased my 1997 Nissan Altima as a Demo car with 7000 miles on it because the dealership was the kindest in letting me out of a bad lease situation.

What a mistake! I have since had the car aligned 4 time since I bought it and if I am traveling over 60 MPH I pull to the left so bad I would be in a ditch in 2 seconds flat. Because of this problem I am already on my second set of tires. The worst part about this car though is the gas mileage, or lack there of. I get the worst gas mileage, for a 4 cylinder car and on top of the bad gas mileage the tank is very small which has me at the gas station every other day!!

Aside from the alignment the car drives decent and for a smaller car it is relatively comfortable, the trunk space is small but functional.<br><br>
