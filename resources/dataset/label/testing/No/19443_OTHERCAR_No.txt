              <b>Mazda</b> isn't the name that immediately comes to mind when thinking about a luxury car manufacturer, in-fact it probably doesn't come to mind at all. The Millenia has changed many people's perceptions, especially the owners of these cars. The '99 models offer good style, excellent dynamics, and good performance, including acceleration, provided a heavy foot.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

  <b>As you jump into the drivers seat</b>, and see the steering wheel swing into place as you insert the ignition key, you know you are in a car that is special, not your average every day Mazda 626. The standard model comes with a 2.5 liter V6, while the S comes with the Lysholm supercharged, 210 horse powered 2.3, Miller cycle 6-cylinder engine. The engine is a little weak at low revs, but pulls fairly well once you get the revs up above 4,000 RPM. Personally, I don't really think this 2.3 supercharged Miller cycle engine was well fitted for the Mazda Millenia S, A 4.0 V8 could have offered close to the same fuel economy, and offered much swifter acceleration. This engine would have been great in the little Miata, that is, if it would fit. 0-60 is rated at 8 seconds flat (according to many specs), but my test car, having over 40,000 miles on it, seemed a tad slower. Don't get me wrong, this car is no dog, it just does not have performance to compete with other entry level luxury sedans such as the Buick Riveira. Tackling hills are a snap, I was very impressed with the Millena's ability to climb hills without down-shifting constantly. If a hill is really steep, the transmission will down-shift to keep this car at a decent freeway speed, but the automatic up-shifting, and downs-shifting is very smooth. 

<b>Handling</b> is excellent. With the S model, the sport turned <b>suspension</b> encourages spirited cornering without giving too hard of a ride. <b>Braking</b> is also good. 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS are standard. The only transmission available is a 4-speed automatic.

    The '99 Millenia S rides on an all-around independent <b>suspension</b> with a multi link system for the front and rear. Coil springs are used all around.

     <b>About the Engine:</b>  The Millenia's V6 uses Miller Cycle technology, rather than the 4 stroke Otto cycle. An important characteristic of the Miller Cycle  engine, is that stroke length varies, making more efficient use of the combustion energy. Compared with a SOHC conventional engine, it comes out ahead. Actual displacement is 2,255 CCs, and the supercharged engine gives 210 horsepower, and 210lb-ft of torque. 

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>    

 The <b>interior</b> is well appointed, targeted as the 'near luxury segment, the Millenia S boasts such amenity features as a Bose stereo system, leather upholstery, and an eight way power drivers seat. Really, this car should be considered a luxury car, not a 'near luxury car.' There is plenty of room in the Millenia S, there is enough room for 5 adults, and this car has a huge trunk.  The seats are very supportive and comfortable. Ergonomics are near perfect. The HVAC controls, Stereo controls, and instrument cluster are all well placed. This excellent interior reinforces the Millenia's luxury and sporting intentions.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
  

The <b>exterior</b> by no means is ugly. Style just is not really this car's strongest attribute. For 1999 the Millenia was given a face lift. Part of this face lift for the 1999 Millenia S are new 17", 5 spoke alloy rims, and lower profile tires. The Millenia's most distinctive exterior feature is the smooth front-end styling. Some may say the Millenia looks a little bit like a larger version of the 626, I'm going to have to agree. I also would like to add that dual exhaust is not provided for the Millenia S, and although some people feel that dual exhaust is unnecessary, I believe it adds to the personality of a car.  

  <b>Price:</b> For the Millenia S, new, ran close to $33,000 when fully loaded. The lesser model could be had for a bit less, but with the 2.5 V6 on the base model, acceleration is not only slow, it's also noisy. With somewhat bad resale value, the '99 Millenia S can be had for around $17,000.

I don't own this car, so I can not comment on reliability, check <b>Consumer Reports. ORG</b>, or find someone who owns one, to get more info in this category.
