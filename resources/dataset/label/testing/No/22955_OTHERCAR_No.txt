            MY EXPERIENCE
I test drove a 2003 Golf GL 5-speed at a local dealership. My test drive lasted about half an hour and covered city streets, winding secondary roads, and the freeway. 

PERFORMANCE
The Golf's 2.0-liter engine develops 115 horsepower, which is nothing special in the budget-sedan class (the Corolla, for example, makes 130). On paper, that sounded like a significant disadvantage, but in real-world driving, I was surprised to find that the Golf's engine felt eager and responsive. There are other competitors that feel stronger, but the Golf feels like it has plenty of power for everyday driving. Wringing out the engine on freeway on-ramps reveals that it runs out of breath at high revs--the Golf feels decidedly more comfortable scooting around town than being pressed to the redline. Under any circumstances, the engine emits a pleasing growl, and transmits very little vibration to the cabin.   

TRANSMISSION/CLUTCH
While the Golf's engine was generally pleasing, the transmission was less satisfying. The shifter had a rubbery, slightly vague feel that was only a minor annoyance in moderate driving, but made it difficult to find the gears quickly when I charged up a freeway on-ramp at full throttle. The Golf's clutch was easy to modulate, but it had a long throw that necessitated too much left-leg aerobics when I changed gears.    

STEERING/HANDLING
This area was a big let-down. When I test-drove the Golf, I was expecting the tight, buttoned-down precision that German cars are known for--and I was disappointed. In spite of Volkswagen's "fun-to-drive" reputation, the Golf's handling is easily bettered by most of its competitors. The suspension is very soft, letting the body lean and wallow noticeably through turns, even those taken at moderate speeds. The steering is light and feels a little vague on-center, requiring a fair amount of correction to maintain a straight course on the freeway. The tires didn't grip very well, either. When I took hard turns, the car understeered considerably, requiring more steering angle than I was prepared for. This was during some really hard driving, so don't get me wrong--the Golf's reflexes are more than adequate for daily driving--but Fahrvargnugen? No way. 

RIDE
The trade-off for the Golf's floaty handling is a smooth, comfortable ride. Freeway travel was serene, interrupted only by the soft suspension's bounding over bumps and dips. The car's structure was solid, engine noise was well-muted, and wind and road noise were almost nonexistent. Unless those floating and bouncing motions bother you (I'm thinking of motion sickness sufferers here), you'll probably find the Golf's ride to be among the best in class.  

INTERIOR
In terms of class, materials quality, and refinement, I found the Golf's interior to be hands-down the best of any of the cars in the budget-sedan class. The mood was dark, businesslike, and very Germanic inside--pretty much everything in my test car's cabin was basic black--but the plastics were premium-quality and almost suede-like in their richness. The dashboard was well-designed and very classy, and it showed a lot of thought had been put into the little details--for example, lighted vanity mirrors and cupholders that slowly emerged from the dash with the push of a button. The seats were very comfortable and supportive, with firm padding to keep the driver comfortable on long drives. Feature content was high, too: there were no less than eight airbags, and the stereo was an eight-speaker unit with tweeters and a subwoofer. From the inside, the Golf felt like it could have been a $30,000 car--I kid you not. This was definitely the Golf's strongest point.  

PRACTICALITY
This is another area where the Golf scores points. Its utilitarian hatchback design is fairly unique in the budget-sedan class. The Hyundai Elantra and Kia Spectra are the  only competitors to offer this body style, and those cars are both shaped more like fastbacks, so you can't pack the tall items that would fit in the Golf's boxy rear end. There's the usual split-folding rear seat, but the bench part of the rear seat also folds forward, allowing the seatback to fold flat against the floor--useful for carrying long, flat items like guitars. Besides the spacious and usable cargo area, the Golf's interior has plenty of space, front and rear, and a wide range of seat adjustments to suit all kinds of drivers. 

RELIABILITY
Here we get to the really bad news. Consumer Reports has rated the Golf's reliability "Much Worse Than Average," and that makes it more than a little difficult to recommend the Golf whole-heartedly. 

OVERALL
The Golf is the only German car in the budget-sedan class, and although it's pricey, it has a solid, sophisticated, and trendy feel that can't be matched by its American, Japanese, and Korean competitors. Its rich materials and attention to detail make all the other economy cars feel like, well, economy cars. It's no sports car, but the Golf's  comfort level and sense of style probably matter more than all-out driving dynamics to most buyers. But when you consider the very subpar reliability record, it's hard to recommend the Golf as a top choice. The probability of mechanical trouble is much higher than in rivals such as the Corolla and Civic, and as I previously noted, the Golf really doesn't have any edge in driving fun over those more-dependable competitors. To me, that means there's little reason to put the Golf on your A-list. On the other hand, the Golf is a very rich, slick little subcompact, and even though it's a little expensive, you'll feel where the money went every time you step inside. If image, refinement, and sophistication are worth the increased risk of mechanical hassles to you, then the Golf is worth a look. But I wouldn't recommend one to a friend--sticking to the best Japanese rivals will net you more driving fun and a lower likelihood of breakdowns.
