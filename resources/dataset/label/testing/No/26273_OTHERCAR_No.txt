            My friend currently owns a 1989' Honda Prelude and his dream car is a Honda Civic Si.  I don't know why.  I understand that they have their little compact car shoot outs, and I understand why they would want to race OTHER compact cars.  I don't know why they want to try to race a Big Block Chevy, like me.  These guys spend thousands of dollars on mods for their cars and they get 200 horsepower out of it, I don't understand.  I read in a magazine, I forget which one, that they took a 00' Civic Si and put $8000 dollars in it and got 202 horsepower out of it.  I mean, mine came w/ 240 horses and know with no more than $2000 in mods, I am pumping 300 horsepower and 480 ft. lb of torque.  I live in a small town and when i go down to Phoenix or Dallas, all these little rice rockets praying for 200 horsepower, are trying to race me and kick my butt.  I saw on Horsepower T.V a rice rocket event with tons of cars there, and most of them were running low 10's and high 9's.  I thought to myself, wow, they are pretty fast, then at the end of the show, they were at an 1/8 mile track, my truck runs that quick stock!  Like I always say to these little &quot;golf carts&quot;, there is no replacement for displacement!<br><br>
