               This was my first digital camera. I bought it so I could add photos to my online auctions and I never really had any luck with it. I only got one memory stick and trying to find an extra was next to impossible. I soon realized that because the view finder is off center, the closer you got, the farther off center the picture got. The flash is automatic, which was more annoying than helpful. The only way to download the pictures is with a serial connection and unless you opted for the AC adapter, you can kiss that battery goodbye before your third photo is done.
   For all its faults, I have to say that if you are looking for a cheap digital camera to take snapshots for e-mail, this is not a bad choice. For auctions that don't need a high resolution picture, it will do until you can afford a better one. The buttons on the camera are simple to learn and straightforward to use.The software that comes with it is fairly easy to use. The camera itself is sturdier than some of the models I've seen. 
   If you are going to buy this remember to get the AC adapter. <br><br>
