                   <b>Economy cars</b> have slowly become more interesting/sophisticated over the years, more so in the past 4 years than ever. In the recent past, cars like the Toyota Corolla, the Toyota Tercel, the Ford Escort, etc etc. all offered good fuel economy, but try to find dual glove boxes on a '95 Escort and you'll be looking for an eternity. I absolutely love automotive innovation, there are only a few exceptions to this rule; cars like the Toyota Echo that offer 'neato' attributes in theory, yet in the real world offer little use or way too many compromises. 
  
<b>For the 2002 model year</b> the Toyota Echo is offered in 2 body styles; a 2 door sedan and a 4 door sedan (tester). A VVT DOHC 1.5 liter 4-cylinder is the only engine available, and can be coupled with either a 4-speed fully automatic (almost an $800 option) transmission, or the standard 5-speed manual tranny (equipped on my tester).

<i>Driving impressions:</i>

 Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> with the 2002 Toyota Echo remains strong when equipped with the 5-speed manual. With only 108 horses and 105 lb-ft of torque one might laugh at the possible 0-60 times, however I found acceleration to equal or better the 'giddy up' offered by more powerful cars like the Ford Focus SE, Kia Spectra, and even close to acceleration offered from the 5-speed equipped Dodge Neon. Thanks to the Echo's light curb weight, the 108 horses offered from this DOHC engine at 6,000 RPM is more than enough to move this 'light weight' quickly from a stop light. Despite the relatively quick acceleration, take-offs do not come painless. The engine groans in popular 4-cylinder fashion through all 5 gears till you hit a decent cruising speed; 50-65 MPH. The 5-speed manual tranny is smooth, but the shifter is hard to reach so my shifts were not as precise as they could have been. The 5-speed manual also needs to be used quite often at low-medium speeds to keep this car from bogging down, or revving unnecessarily high. It's virtually impossible to get a quiet ride from this car while driving through town, but then again the same thing can be said about most cars that start out at $13,000. 

<b>Handling</b> in this subcompact 4-door sedan is probably this cars's worst performance characteristic. The tires are not 'too' small, however the sedan is so tall in height it seems like the car is riding on 10" wheels (kinda like the older Chevy Astro Vans). P175/65R/14s are added, I can think of a worse case scenario in the wheel department, however P185-195,60R,14s or 15s would be much appreciated. Driving through the twistys is by no means difficult, it just isn't fun. Cars like the Focus, Hyundai Accent, and the Kia Spectra all take to the turns with much more enthusiasm than the Toyota Echo. Also the fun factor of taking to the twistys is further diminished  because your eyes are constantly off the road looking at the 'off center' instrument cluster. This is one of the first cars I have driven where the interior design played such a large role is the performance or 'lack of' department. 

<b>Cruising,</b> as I mentioned before, quiets down after you hit 60-65 MPH. The relatively "quiet cruising" is limited however, and can only be had on smooth surfaces and as long as you keep your speed between 50-65 MPH and your transmission in high gear. Anything above 65 MPH means the engine starts to groan, and the DOHC 1.5 really starts to show its underpinnings. Wind, engine, and roadgrain noise can be heard very clearly past 75 MPH, and the car seems unstable over large or even small bumps in the road at almost any speed. Hills are taken well, a down-shift into 4th makes for very snappy acceleration up the steepest inclines. The 2002 Echo can tackle some hills (5% or lower grades) in 5th gear, however you'll find yourself flooring the gas pedal just to maintain 65 MPH. 

<b>Braking</b> is adequate, but like this car's handling attributes it has its short comings. Coming to a sudden stop takes too much time, and this particular 'front disc rear drum dinosaur set-up' makes for these stops to be unrefined, as a slight vibration was felt in the steering wheel under hard braking. I have also had this problem with 2000-2001 Echo's, so I'm not so sure that this is just an isolated problem. 

<b>Fuel Economy</b> is excellent. For 2002 the EPA is about 34/41 MPG, these numbers match the older 3-cylinder Geo Metro's without the 'out-right performance' compromise, and comes close to the fuel economy offerd from the <a href="/content_74102312580"> 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid</a>.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

The <b>interior</b> of the Toyota Echo is where my major gripes come into play. The steering wheel is thick enough, but when behind the drivers seat and looking directly in front of you, all you see is gray plastic dash space where you would think an instrument cluster would and should be. Instead Toyota thought they'd do something cool/different and put the tiny oval instrument cluster to the right (almost the middle of the dash) so the driver doesn't get distracted with important gauges. On the road this becomes annoying, and despite what many people say about this instrument cluster placement, I never got used to it, nor did I ever find it accommodating. A Toyota sales associate argued "Who looks at their gauges anyway? You should have your eyes on the road at all times not the gauges." On the contrary, I always keep a close eye on both all my gauges and the road. With the instrument cluster to the side I felt like I almost had to turn my head to look at the white gauged cluster. The instrument cluster placement is not my only complaint, the fact that it doesn't have a tachometer is just plain 'lude'. One of my favorite aspects of driving a 5-speed is using the tach to make my shifts, with the Echo I didn't have this luxury. Speaking of the 5-speed, the gear shifter is much too small, jutting out of the car's floor like a little mushroom wrapped in simulated blue leather. This small shifter disabled me from keeping my body in an upright position at all times as I had to ever so slightly lean sideways and forward to move the shifter into 5th. Amenities are adequate but not impressive by any means. An optional good sounding 4-speaker Cd player, A $700 optional AC system, standard 3 cup holders, dual air bags, dual glove boxes, tons of storage areas, and a digital clock were equipped on my tester. The front bucket seats are hard as a rock, and offer no adjustments. The rear seats are made of the same undesirable cloth/vinyl material which makes for some of the cheapest feeling seats in this class, the Kia Rio being close. Room is good, plenty of room for 4 adults, and can squeeze in 5 adults if needed. Both head and leg room are adequate for anybody in the 5ft range. Thanks to the tall roof line head room is amazing. 

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

The <b>exterior</b> looks exactly like it did upon introduction, which means it still looks odd, and a little like a smaller version of  the hybrid 'Prius'. The 2 door and 4 door sedans both look more like novelty items than 'real cars'. Although very modern/futuristic looking the Echo looks cheap, and the plastic ground effects just add to this theme. Want alloy rims? Sorry you'll have to go 'aftermarket', as the 2002 Toyota Echo only comes with steel rims with hubcaps. I also suggest going to larger rims or tires, the tires look extremely small for this car. The 4 door and the 2 door both come with an optional spoiler which I find adds very little 'sport' to this funky looking design. 

<i>Price, Reliability, and Warranty:</i> 


Base price starts out at around $13,000, but with options such as AC, and CD player the price can rise to near $15,000, as was the price on my tester. As with most Toyota products these cars have been very reliable according to most owners, including a friend of mine who has owned a 2000 model for almost 3 years and has put on over 60,000 miles on her Echo. Most complaints include squeeks and rattles appearing after a few years of ownership, I would also watch out for braking components. <b>www. ConsumerReports.Org</b> has more info. If this car does happen to be the proverbial 'lemon', Toyota offers a 3 year, 36,000 mile bumper-bumper warranty, and a 5 year, 60,000 mile power train warranty. An extended warranty can be purchased.
