            We won a $100 gift certificate on the website www.buybidwin.com and decided to purchase this camera. Thank goodness it was free. The pictures are REALLY fuzzy and the colors are not very bright.
 I have wanted a digital camera for a very long time and was very disappointed with this one. But like I said, it was free. The beep that tells you you have taken a picture is extremely faint. The setup to the computer was fairly easy but the software that comes with the camera, PhotoWise, leaves a lot to be desired.
 The download time from the camera to the computer is very slow. I was also dismayed to learn that it only holds 16 pictures. It almost is worth it to go and buy film and get it developed so you can at least have 24 pictures!
 Also, You have to get right up to your subject to take the picture in order to not have it distorted. And the main thing is, we put the brand new batteries that came with the camera in and then took 16 pictures, downloaded them and took 16 more and the batteries were dead. Off to Radio Shack I go for some rechargeable batteries!
 All in all, I say &quot;Save Your Money!&quot;<br><br>
