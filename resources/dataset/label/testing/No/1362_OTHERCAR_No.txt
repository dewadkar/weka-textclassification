            I'll just add to the litany of problems with the '95 Mystique I have read and experienced. I purchased my Mystique new in the summer of '95. Several weeks after I had to have a leaky trunk and a grinding passenger door repaired. That winter, which was specially snowy and I needed my ABS most, two of them failed completely. Electrical problems, too numerous to list, began to appear. And how about this, I got about 14,000 miles out of the brakes before I had to replace them along with two disks! I'm now at 80,000 miles and I've just had my fourth set of brakes (all 4), 6 disks, and now 2 calipers. Then I had the delightful experience of two recalls: one for the gas tank and another for the seatbelts, During the third year my catalytic converter &quot;plugged up&quot; and I received the recall notice while it was in the shop for repair! Additionally, my paint began peeling at the end of the third year on the hood and roof. Ford did not consider it a warranted repair. This car has spent entirely too many days (weeks) in the repair shop. Just prior to being out of warranty, a short in the wiring harness fried the computer.

Oh, yes! That onboard diagnostics computer, highly touted in the car rags, never indicated any problems until the whole thing was in complete chaos during the wiring harness fiasco. 

I do have to comment on the driving aspect: the car is really fun to drive and handles very well, when it is running. I like the interior design and the overall appearance inside and out. The front seats have enough room but adults will find the rear confining. Trunk space although deep enough is a bit narrow. My golf clubs will not fit across the width or length (unless you drop the rear seat). I have to angle them in. The vehicle is noisy when driving. Along with interior squeaks there is also significant &quot;road&quot; noise.

I still have the vehicle but will &quot;unload&quot; it in the next few months. I can tell you now, my new one will not be a Ford. <br><br>
