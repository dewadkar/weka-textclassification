            I bought a 1991 Eagle Talon used in June of this year.  When I bought it, it seemed to run very good, and it's handling was simply unsurpassed for the type of car, in it's price range.  I bought this car mainly because I drive a rather large quanity of miles each year, and it was what I thought to be a &quot;steal&quot; of a buy.
Not more than two weeks after purchasing this car, I had to replace the exhaust manifold (it had several cracks in it).  I looked at every salvage yard that was within reasonable mileage to get to (within 200 miles), and found several- but they were also all cracked, these cars had anywhere from 14,000 miles all the way up to 135,000 miles.  If this is such a common problem on this car, why didn't the manufacturer perform a recall on this part?  Well, I wanted to know, so I contacted Mitsubishi to find out.  They told me that was infact, not a common problem, I had just ran across a few that were cracked, and had a case of bad luck on my part.  Well, I put $340.00 out for the part alone (The dealer wanted $800.00 to replace it, part included), and then paid a mechanic $125.00 in labor to remove and reinstall the new manifold.
Well, everything was fine for a while, until I noticed a small transmission leak, so again, I went to the dealer to inquire how much that would cost to fix.  This is a 5 speed transmission, and the seal is about the size of a fifty cent piece.  The seal is for the transmission shifting linkage on the top of the transmission.  The dealer informed me that they would have to take the transmission completely out of the car, remove the casing from the transmission, and put this $3.40 seal in it, and further informed me that I was looking at about $775.00 total to fix it.  I inquired with several other mechanics, and the dealer was correct, the transmission had to come out of the car to replace this $3.40 seal, which I later found out to be another very common problem amongst these cars.  I had the seal replaced at about $600.00 later.  Everything was fine and dandy until just recently, I got off of the interstate in St. Louis, Missouri, and found that I only had 2nd gear, and 5th gear, no reverse, no 1st, no 3rd, and no 4th gears.  Again, I called the dealer, they quoted me an astronomical figure of $2800.00 to replace the transmission.  I just continued driving the car until the transmission finally gave out, and sold it that way.  Oh, also... both of the windows would never stay on track, which ended up shattering both of them, the driver's side twice, which cost me another $600.00 total to replace, and the dealer supposedly fixed this problem as well...
All in all, I would never recommend this car to anyone, regardless of the year of the car, based on one simple fact:  The manufacturer will not back their own mistakes honestly, and charges outrageous prices to repair these mistakes.  Any other foriegn vehicle usually lasts about 150,000 miles before these things begin going wrong with them, mine had only 72,000 miles on it, and should not have had this many problems with this low of mileage.  I did perform a carfax on this car just to make sure the mileage was accurate, and it sure was.  Two of my friends have similar cars (one's an eclipse, and the other is a laser), and they have both had similar problems with their cars, and have had to put alot of money into them as well.  Please take heed to this review on this car, and do some more research prior to buying one of these cars!!!  You're most likely not going to get just what you've bargained for.<br><br>
