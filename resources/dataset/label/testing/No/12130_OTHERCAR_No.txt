            I bought a 2000 Mazda 626 LX (4 cyl.) last month. The car was beautiful inside and out, and then it hit me. This is no Mazda, its a ford and the fact that you buy parts that come from Ford prove it. A mechanic said that except for the head (which says Mazda), the engine is a ford. 
So reliability is out of the question when buying a Mazda. 
Mine had 72000 miles on it, and while the engine was still running fine, the transmission needed major rebuilding (something about the drive chain, clutch drum and torque converter). Don't even think about going to the dealership, asked 2700 for a new one (no rebuild). a mechanic told me that these transmissions are so bad they fall of cars. 
When it comes to acceleration, don't bother. It has adequate acceleration only for people that come from countries where only old bikes and bicycles are used. 

If you are a 6 footer, forget about it. While the car has a tilt steering wheel, it refuses to go up to the point where driving is possible, in fact its lower than any car I have driven so far. Backseat room is adequate even for big fellas. 
Finally, the audio system is loud and enjoyable, that is if the cd player has not broken down yet.
