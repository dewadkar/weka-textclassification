            I wanted to take photos without always being seen taking them.  In SECRET.  I choose this one because it had a voice recorder too.  Having to carry only one gadget seemed like a good idea.  However, the recorder was terrible.  In a completely silent room I tried to record a simple �1..2..3..�.  There was so much static it sounded like I recorded while standing next to a vacuum cleaner while it was running.  Also, even if you yelled into it, you had to put it next to your ear to make out the garble.  It isn�t loud enough, nor is it very good quality.
You must anticipate the low battery blinking display, or you lose all your pictures.  For example, you took pictures of your child�s first t-ball game, you would need to immediately upload to a computer/laptop because when the batteries go, so do your pictures.  Also, you only get 26 at high resolution.  It would be a bummer if you didn�t leave your laptop in the car for this purpose of uploading to continuing taking pictures.  But, with summer coming on, leaving an expensive laptop in a hot car would be an even bigger bummer!
Picture quality is blurry and grainy.  If you are trying to take a quick picture, don't bet on a good shot.  It takes good picture if taking up close, like taking a picture of something laying on the desk in front of you, like your keyboard, but anything at a distance is terrible (even just 10 feet away).  No matter how well lit the area and how steady the camera is held, the picture will be blurry.
If you wanted to take a picture secretly, the beep from the shutter gives you a way.  However, if you aren�t being sneaky, there are two different types of beeps.  One lets you know if there is enough light to take the picture, the other lets you know when you have taken a picture.
I found the software to be very archaic.  You don�t get an option on what format to save images to.  It saves them as bitmaps (bmp) making emailing the high-resolution pictures difficult because of file size.  After uploading it is difficult to manage your images. With today�s ever-changing technology, I expect more from the software and hardware than what this product offers.
All in all, this camera is going back to Best Buy tomorrow.  I do not recommend this one.
