            I bought this camera so that I could put pictures on the internet for auctions, etc. I also liked the idea of being able to do inexpensive projects with the kids...posters, pictures for family members etc.

We only paid $99.00 plus shipping through AOL and it did come pretty quick, no complaints there=)

The camera serves it's purpose, for the time being, but if I could go back I would probably wait until I could afford a better one. It's ok for a first camera and it is good for enough for most of what I use it for but it's hard to get good close ups from it and it doesn't hold much in the memory, although you can purchase additional cards.

It's been a really neat toy for us though...I love being able to share pictures online with family and friends...just the technology of it all is exciting to us still=)

It's also good for making sales flyers if you have something to sell in your community... a sofa for instance! Just put the photo on regular copy paper and add your info=)

After all is said and done, I would say to look carefully and investigate your options before putting your money into it. If you are looking for a first digital camera for sharing photos with family and such...it's not a bad camera for the basics.

I do like the idea of being able to get the pictures right away and not have to pay for the developing too, so it really was worth it to us in the long run, but still...I wish I'd waited, but hey... life is still good=)
