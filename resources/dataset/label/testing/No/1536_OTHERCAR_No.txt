            Saturn. A word that, before 1991, would conjure up thoughts of a large ball of gas, surrounded by beautiful rings of ice and rock. Now all that comes to mind is a small <i>tank</i> of gas, enshrouded in alloy metals, and inexpensive (yet, dent resistant) door, fender, and quarter panels. My mother is the (oddly) proud owner of a '96 Saturn SL1. Yes, the base model. 5-speed transmission, 1.9L 4 cylinder, no A/C, no tilt steering, just the bare essentials. Driving the Saturn is similar to going camping in the back yard. It's fun until your about 5 years old and realize that this isn't the real deal. For the $8,000 we paid for it, I'd rather have an older Japanese auto, such as the Mitsubishi Eclipse, or the ever popular Civic. ...but no. We had to have the Saturn. When my mom first brought it home, my friends and I had buckets upon buckets of fun throwing anything we could find at the doors, in a maniacal attempt to dent the them. Score 1 point for Saturn. We couldn't dent them. I've driven the car a few times, although only in a parking lot, and no faster than 2nd gear. I don't like driving this car. It feels like you have to push way too far. Any other 5-speed I've driven, the clutch was like stepping on a button. In this car, it's like stepping in a ditch. At least the stereo sounds good. The only problem with the factory audio, is that the more you raise the volume, you must sacrifice some bass. One quarter turn clockwise of volume, requires one counter-clockwise turn of the bass dial. It gets annoying after awhile. My biggest complaint about the Saturn? The <b>power</B>. ...or should I say, the lack of power? Only 105HP out of 1.9L? The late Civics in the 80s got 95HP out of an 800cc engine! I think Saturn could improve here. Did I mention that it went down in value 50% in only 3 years? That's pretty pathetic, considering that I have a 1978 Toyota pick-up, that's still worth one third of it's value today. Maybe it's something about Japanese cars? Whatever. I'd rather drive the Toyota, then the Saturn.
