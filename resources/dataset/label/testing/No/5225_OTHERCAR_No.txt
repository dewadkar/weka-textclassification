            The DX-10 is my first digital camera and I bought it because I wanted to get rid of the film processing problem and as I almost only show pictures to friends and family by sending them by e-mail it is much more comfortable to transfer pictures to the computer.

What I like about the DX-10:
- Easy to use in automatic mode.
- Small enough to take anywhere
- The small price (I paid $170)
- Pretty good pictures in automatic mode


What I don't like about the DX-10:
- There is no lens cover, 
- It really eats batteries 
- It comes with only 2MB of Memory (which is not much!)
- The display is not useful if it is dim.
- The manual mode (not very helpful, as there are so many options and even though I really tried - the pictures in manual mode are never as good as in the auto mode).
- Shooting in dim light can give pretty grainy results


Essential accessories:
- A larger Smart Media Card to take more pictures
- Two sets of rechargeable batteries
- The Floppy Adapter to transfer pictures to the PC almost instantaneously.

The camera is great for someone who never used a digital cam before as it is easy to use, inexpensive and light. But if you really want to take a lot of pictures and photo quality is very important to you, than I wouldn't recommend it.
