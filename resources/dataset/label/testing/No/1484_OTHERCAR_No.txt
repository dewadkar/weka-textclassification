            I bought a 2001 Cougar v6, reasonably optioned out.  The sticker was $21,115, and I paid $17,300 for the car, from Sunland L/M in Glendale Arizona.  The styling is fantastic.  This is a car that turns heads and gets noticed.  Many looks, many complements (mine was in the dark green metallic).  The car handled well; not a race car, or even a sports car, but its' handling was predictable and confident.  Brakes were solid, pretty strong engine, though more would have been nice (isn't that ALWAYS the case?).  The real problem, though, was the number of major issues I had with the car.  The first was something to do with the throttle body.  The mechanic told me that had it not been covered, it would have been somewhere around $800 to $1000 to fix.  The vehicle would ALWAYS hesitate bad when the tank had less than 1/4 of gas.  Bad fuel pump design, which led to the next major problem.  The fuel pump.  Dead.  Also covered, but when the mechanic recommends you not allow it to go below 1/2 tank (reducing your cruising distance to about 160 miles), you have to wonder.  I did.  I wondered what I would do when the warranty was over.  Lastly, the anti-rattle clip had fallen from the driver's side front brake caliper.  The resulting imbalance chewed through the brake pads very quickly, and gouged the rotor, as well.  Ford refused to cover it; not even the rotor.  That was the last straw.  I traded the car in with just under 30,000 miles on it.
