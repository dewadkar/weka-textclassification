            My sister purchased a used Nissan Sentra from a local dealership in the summer of 1996.  She had to have a car and had $5000 to burn, so she basically took one of the first cars she had looked at.  It was a used car and it had about 96,000 miles on it.  It had been worn it and it was five years old.

So she drove it home and we all celebrated that evening. The next morning she woke to find the front left tire had deflated.  This seemed a little strange to me. This was the next day after she had bought this car!  It ended up needing a new tube, so we got that fixed and everything was good. Later that month, we went on a road trip from Savannah to Asheville NC. 

We were actually worried about the car being able to make this 300 mile trip to the mountains. At this point, the car's A/C couldn't be left on for extended periods of time without the car overheating.  We made it up to NC fine and stayed a few days and came back down.  We were driving outside of Irmo, SC and the car began to smoke. We pulled into a gas station thinking it was the radiator.  Well it ended that the transmission had failed and the car stayed in Irmo to get fixed while we took a greyhound back to Savannah.

This whole ordeal cost $1500. We got the car back and my sister decided she was going to get another car. It sat in our front yard for three months and then i turned 16.  I had the choice of spending $2000 on a used car, or I could fix the Sentra up.  I chose to fix the Sentra up and found out that the transmission needed to be replaced again! That was $1500 of my original $2000.

The rest of the money was spent on new CV joints and new brakes(drums and pads) and a new muffler.  I finally sold this car about a year ago to some unlucky soul.  This car had a total of $5000 dollars put into.  So that brings the grand total to $10,000. This car was not worth it. Many times I question whether it was put together by drunk people.  The scary thing is that i have known others who have had a similar model car and had similar situations occur to it.

Get a mechanic to check your car out thoroughly before buying.
