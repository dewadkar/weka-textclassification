                The newly revamped Celica GT version is unfortunately in my opinion a bit of a disappointment. The exterior is refined and flashier than its predecessor yet some flaws are apparent. Its performance should not place the car in the sports car family.

    Starting with the exterior, one could never guess that the car was from the Celica family. Car models even when newly remodeled usually have a distinct look that resembles it to its roots. A good example can be made from the MR2 and the MRS. The MRS captures the MR2 spirit. From its sleek style to air vents on the side, Toyota built and improved upon its previous model. The new Celica is simply another car. It doesn't resemble its predecessor at all. With that point made, the exterior isn't bad but something is definetely missing. The standard wheels are just too small and the suspension leaves the car on stilts. When sitting in the car, there is no sporty feeling when you're so high up from the ground.

    The high ride of the car leaves the driver with little confidence to really punch it during the turns. The sleepy 140 horsepower just isn't enough for the GT. You would think that Toyota left the Celica underpowered long enough. With the boxy shaped exterior its hard to see what's creeping up behind you from the rearview window. 

   The Celica looks best with body kits but who really has the money. The base model GT just doesn't cut it in my book. From its incomplete exterior to its lackluster off the line power, its not the car for me or i feel for any sports car enthusiast with a budget.   <br><br>
