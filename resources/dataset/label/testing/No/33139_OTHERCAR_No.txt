            I am astounded by the amount of positive opinions of this clunker.  Test driving this was a truly scary experience.  Attracted by an offer of one month free, no security or any down payment, and a low monthly lease payment, my husband and I decided to give the Malibu a try.  We thought we would get a lot of car for a little money.  HAH!

Truth be known, this is initially an attractive looking car.  And the pop-down rear seats was a welcome bonus.  However, upon closer inspection, you can feel the sheer cheeziness of it all once in the car and behind the wheel.  Much plastic and thin, chintzy upholstery detracted from this car's outer aesthetic appeal.

But the worst part of the experience was actually taking this rattle-box on the road.  Almost immediately after pulling out of the dealer's showroom the clanking began.  At first we thought that the salesman who accompanied us hadn't adhered the license plate tightly enough, but no, it was not a loose plate.  It was the innards of this dangerous feeling car.  After a couple of miles, I dared not take it on the highway to see how it performed there.  The handling was not steady, it felt as if the doors might pop off at any moment, and it was loud.

We went with the Lumina for a few bucks more, but that's another opinion.

A few weeks after the treacherous test drive we were telling a friend who sold Nissans about it.  He laughed and had his own Malibu story to tell.  This is truly bizarre.

A woman walked into his dealership and said that she wanted to trade in her 1999 Malibu immediately.  It was only February of 1999, and he told her that he couldn't let her do that because after doing the calculations she would end up losing $6000, as the car, although only in her possession a week or so, had devalued that much.  She told him she didn't care.  He called his boss and tried to find a way to get her more money.  But even after foregoing his own commission or whatever he would have earned from the deal, she still was losing a lot of money.  They coerced her to go home and give the Malibu some time.  Told her to drive it around and get used to it.  So she did that.

A week later she was back insisting she trade it in for an Altima.  Again they tried to talk her out of it, but she would not be moved.  She claimed that she felt she was in a death trap when in the Malibu and that she was terrified to drive it.  She said it constantly pulled away from her on the highway, and she refused to drive it ever again.  She said that she would leave the car there no matter what.  So they did the deal and gave her an Altima.  She thanked them and went on her way.

One day at lunch, my friend decided to see what this &quot;nutty lady&quot; was talking about.  How bad could it be?  Pretty bad.  He took it a few blocks, and came right back to work.  Said it pulled him everywhere, and he's not a small guy.

A week later the lady came back, and my friend figured, &quot;Uh oh.  She finally came to her senses and realizes what she had done and now is going to kill me for the $6000 loss she incurred.&quot;  But no, she came back just to thank him again for taking the Malibu off of her hands.  She thanked him, even though she was out $6000 and had her Malibu for less than three weeks.

I just don't get the people who wrote positive reviews.  They must have magic Malibus or something.<br><br>
