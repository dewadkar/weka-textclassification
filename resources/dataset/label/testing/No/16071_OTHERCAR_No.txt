            I bought my 1997 Grand Cherokee because it looked less like a monster truck. It has beautiful lines. It is very easy to handle, it rides more like a large car than a truck. Visibility is great. The big draw back on this vehicle (which probably is true for all SUV's) it's hard to get into. If you have elderly relatives they need a step stool to get in. When my lease was up, I went to a Volvo S80. The most revealing thing to me, was to realize that I was an aggressive driver when I drove the Jeep. There is something inherently powerful in driving a Jeep. Now, driving a car I see how much more relaxed and less aggressive on the road. The motor mounts on my Jeep has to be replaced twice in 2 years, as well as the brakes.

The Grand Cherokee is stylish and easy to drive. It is more comfortable than the Sport Jeep. The V6 has great pickup. Turning at high speeds should be taken with caution. I always felt as if I were about to tip over. This is something I don't feel in my Volvo. 

If your thinking of purchasing a Jeep, make sure you have a need for it. It is not a vehicle just for city driving or in warm weather. This is a vehicle for snow and rough roads. 

I thought Jeep Service, at least in Manhattan was the worst I have ever experienced. <br><br>
