            Yes I too am a SUV owner...and to tell you the truth its not what it seems to be.  Yeah you see those great ad's on the tv in between the show your watching.  They show you how great they are for families and how they come with passenger airbags.  They go to such length to tell you all the good qualities...that you get to the point you think wow what a great deal.  Well I for one wish they would put just as much effort into the bad stuff as they do the good.  Well I'm here to tell ya just that.  The Chevy blazer is one of the better SUV's out there.  The good lord knows there's a lot.  BUT!!  They break down a lot.  In one year i put three thousand dollars into fixing and keeping it up.  The radiator had to be replaced three times. They do not handle city driving very well.  My blazer was in and out of the shop fixing and replacing parts of the engine.  Everytime one thing was fixed another broke.  I'm not here to give the car a bad name or any of the SUV's.  I'm just here to warn you that if you decide to buy the car...know this...You won't be paying just the price of the vehicle at the dealer ship.  There will be much more to come!!<br><br>
