            I owned a '93 Geo Metro for a little over a year (98-99).  My Grandparents then gave me a '92 Chevy Caprice because I wanted something bigger and more powerful.  See my review on the Caprice to see how that turned out.  Anyway, I don't have much bad to say about the Geo.  There was a string of weekends where I was caught on I-70 here in NE Kansas when ultra-violent storms hit and I just gripped the wheel, gritted my teeth and sailed through in the little Geo not even slowing down when tons and tons of people were sidelined on the shoulders and under the overpasses.  Since then I've gotten a lot of advice saying that that wasn't smart to do.  The air conditioner in this car is phenomenal.  My Grandpa backed it out of the drive one day and he noticed this;  he said it was freezing cold by the time he was at the end of the drive.    

I never had any mechanical problems with the Geo.  I still don't know exactly why I bought it.  I could have gotten a bigger, better car, but I think that I was really in to economy back then.  

I gave this car to my younger brother.  He says he drove it at 95+ mph(but, then again, he says a lot of things).  Supposedly, some of the car flew off when he did this.  

All around, this model is a good car.  I was probably the most reliable car I ever had, if not the fastest or flashiest.  Still I don't think I'd recommend it because of it's lack of power, space and comfort.        <br><br>
