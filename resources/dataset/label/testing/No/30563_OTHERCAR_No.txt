            My pilot is only 2 weeks old and I am still not sure if I like it or not. I bought it for the following reasons: larger family, all the rave reviews, my friend told me he loved it, and because of supposedly good Honda quality.

Cons:
I did test drive it briefly before buying and found it boring - that hasn't changed.

What I did discover to my dismay was that the stock 7 speaker stereo with subwoofer produces absolutely horrible sound and the FM reception is poor. I am not an audiophile, but this radio sounds awful for any car, especially for a $30,000 car. That Pontiac I had 15 years ago sounded 1000 times better (thats right - 1000 times). I know, some may say that my particular radio was probably broken. Let me assure you, I checked a few other Pilots and they ALL have this problem. FM reception is poor because of the etched antenna.

With only 3 miles on the odometer, right off dealer's lot the car pulled to the right because wheel alignment was off. This was corrected by the dealer.

Anyone planning to buy this SUV should look carefully at the factory recommended maintenance schedule first, which along with regular oil changes requires other things that will add to the cost of ownership including regular changes of Transmission and rear Differential fluids.

Pilot's leather seats are too soft and sag quickly. I would like nice firm supportive seats. There is a huge thread on honda-pilot.org about this problem.

Steering is too light and feels numb.

Unlike some reports, I think this SUV feels big.

Don't expect more than 13 - 14 mpg in city driving.

Instrument panel is largely obscured by steering wheel.

Seat leather is fragile.

Factory RES system is $2,000. Aftermarket with install $1,000.

NAV option - $2,000. Aftermarket portable unit - $900

No moon roof option.

Pros:
Comfortable ride. This SUV rides comfortably and safely, although quick lane changes require more attention than usual.
Climate control system is powerful and quiet.
Good road visibility.
Ride is quiet, I know because I keep the radio off most of the time.
Lots of cargo and misc storage space.
Easy to park in a city because of angled front bumper corners.
