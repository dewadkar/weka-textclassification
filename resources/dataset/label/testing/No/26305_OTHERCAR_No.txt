            I bought a blue Civic SI for my wife figuring that it was a reliable car.  I couldn't have been more wrong, within the first month the car had broken down 3 times.  Getting anything out of Honda is like squeezing water from a stone and they insisted that it was being driven too hard during the break in period.  However, this is not possible since it spent most of that time on a lift at Honda.
After the first month it continued to be troubled with transmission and electrical problems daily, the lemon law finally freed me from the clutches of Honda Motor Co. 
Second time around I bought my wife a 2000 Jetta GLX, more money but hell of a lot more car.  It actually has torque and the redline is not on someother planet making the car too loud and too slow on the highway like in the Honda.  I should have known that the Civic was junk because too many people modify them at any expense hoping to have a better car in the end, like the Jetta GLX.  In the end though the Jetta is just better, faster, and gets way more attention.  Now when i think of Honda I say, &quot;Don't they make good lawn mowers?&quot;<br><br>
