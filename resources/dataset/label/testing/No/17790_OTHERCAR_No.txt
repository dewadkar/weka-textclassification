            This is an add on to my other artical on this van I had written earlier today.  (see never buy this van by inka)  As I was taking the van to the dealership today for the new transmission I have to pay for, the brakes and power steering also went out on the van and caused an accident, luckily no one was injured.  Finally, when I got to the dealership and told them about it they still won't pay.  This van has been more trouble than it's worth.  In just 3 years the transmission, brakes, and power steering have failed, and GM won't back up their products.<br><br>
