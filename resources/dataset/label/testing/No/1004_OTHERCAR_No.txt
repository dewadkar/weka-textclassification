            I test drove this car and the handling and acceleration was decent.  I liked the ride.  It drove fairly well, although I definitely felt the inertia on the tight turns.  In other words, my passengers had to brace themselves.  But I guess this it to be expected in a lower priced car.  The inside looks beautiful with the futuristic dashboard.  I like that trendy stuff. Since I knew that there was a chance that the car would have problems because its a new model, I kind of expected at least one.  It was funny to me and my girlfriend when the windshield wipers went on and did not shut off, for no reason,  It was as if the car was possessed.  I tried pulling over and turning the car on and off, to no avail. The wipers were dry so they of course kept making a loud squeaky sound.  I had to keep spraying windshield wiper fluid to stop the noise for the rest of the ride.  The dealer shouted "SHUT OFF THE CAR!" as soon as we pulled back into the lot.  I guess he was embarrassed.  The car overall seemed solid, but regardless, I bought a Honda civic instead mainly because of the price difference rather than the car itself.  If your buying a first year car model...WATCH OUT for minor mechanical flaws like this one!!!  The car also made a unidentified squeaky noise from the passenger side, which was extremely bothersome.  Even though I do not recommend this car, I can not say too many bad things about it except for the slightly uneasy ride and the fact that I believe in not buying any car the first year it comes out.  I feel that next year they will improve any flaws as Toyota is known to have an excellent track record.  Wait till the 2004 models come out to get one if you can. Good Luck
