            I returned a Kodak I got for Xmas and "upgraded" to this camera. 

I will not bore you with all of the features of this camera as  that can be obtained from Sony. What can't be obtained from Sony is what this camera is poor at doing or can't do at all.

I will just point out some of the flaws and a few good points.  

I am not a professional photographer at all so I will start by saying the pictures that were good were good.  I don't know about chromographic aboration or whatever.

The software that comes with the camera pretty much sucks.  Downloading is a snap but there appears no way to do a manual slideshow between the pics.  Each time you want to view a pic full size you have to double-click and then close it out and go back and double-click each pic. 

Everytime you download photos they are put into a folder buried in a folder and so on so that it is a pain in the butt to try and pull up your pics.  All pics when downloaded are assigned a number and if you want to rename the pics you have to pull up each one manually, look at it, remember which number it is/and pic and then rename it to something familiar.  

The camera is pretty intuitive after you figure it out.  Start up time is fairly quick and if you prefocus the shutter lag is pretty quick.

The flash is more than adequate for pics.  It is actually too bright and requires turning down the manual exposure controls and flash output to get a decent picture. Since the flash is a few inches away from the lens it tends to create  unappealing shadows if people or objects are next to any type of wall or even within several feet when the flash goes off.

The focus system of this camera absolutely blows.  Even if you are dead still there is a good chance you are going to get a less than crisp picture.  I took several at a birthday party and was extremely disappointed at the amount of blurriness with about 40% of the pics.  I am glad I didn't pay for developing. I have used several cameras and never had blurriness like that.  I tend to hold a camera very still when shooting. If you want to capture anything that is moving and still retain a nice picture just forget it. Candid shots are pretty much out of the question.  By the time your camera focuses and decides to take a picture the scene you wanted to capture is gone.  The result is an overflowing album of posed shots involving people.

There is no mode to take quick action shots which is a serious downfall in my opinion.

There doesn't seem to be any pattern with this camera when it comes to deciding whether to take a blurry picture or clear picture.

Additionally if you take pictures of objects with straight up and down lines, like doors or windows or trees, then you will certainly notice the extreme distortion the lens on this camera creates with the picture.  It is fish-eye like bowing in at the tops and bottoms on both sides.  It was ridiculously  obvious.

The camera does seem sturdy and battery life is OK with the included 2 Nickel metal hydride 2100mah AA size batteries that come with it.  It comes with the charger for the batteries and usb cable for the computer.  In a pinch though you can use standard alkalines which don't last very long to say the least.  But it is a nice feature if are somewhere and you can't charge your batteries.

It fits in to a pocket fairly well at around nine ounces.

The other cable included hooks up to your tv for viewing of pics on the included miniscule 16mb memory stick.

The memory stick is Sony's memory storage system.  It is pretty much lame also in the respect that it generally costs at least twice as much as an equivalent Compact Flash card with the same capacity. That certainly increases the cost of using this camera when/if you decide to increase your storage.  With a 16mb memory stick you can expect to take about 7 pictures in the 5.0 megapixel range and then it is full.

It has an easy to use vga mode where it will take pics around 150k and 640x480 for emailing pics in a smaller size file than the 2mb that the 5.0mp pics require.

It has a threaded bottom portion for tripod attachment.

One would think that a Sony product would be of good quality enough to warrant a decent warranty.  Well it comes with a 90 days parts and labor with a one year parts.  Several other models of cameras come with 1 year parts and labor.  

Another odd thing is the Sony memory stick only has a 3 month warranty and the Lexar and Sandisk memory sticks come with a five year and or lifetime, and they are usually always cheaper than the Sony memory stick. What are you really saying about your product when you offer a cheesy warranty like Sony does?

The Sony memory stick also tops out at 1 gigabyte at this point whereas Compact Flash(CF) that other cameras use is at 4 gigabytes as I type.

On at least one of Sony's latest released cameras they utilize memory stick and CF. That should say something.

It is a decent camera but I was not terribly happy with it. The straw that broke the camel's back and made me bring it back to Sears for  a full refund was the rebate scam Sony has going on.  I purchased the camera on Dec 26 and filled out the $50 rebate in its entirety that night.  It was in the mail the next day from our locked mailbox which only the post office has a key to.  After checking the status online a few times I finally get an email on Jan 21 stating that my letter was postmarked Jan 20 and I missed the cutoff date. What a load of BS!!  The cutoff date was the beginning of January and I know it was sitting on someone's desk before the end of December.  Well they won't answer my emails and getting them on the phone is impossible.  I think it is a direct reflection on the Sony company when they pull crap like that concerning customers rebates.

Couple this with my other review concerning the 65" Sony tv I purchased new for $2800 last year that required over $1400 worth of warranty work after two weeks of ownership and the remote that went bum on the same tv after a few months  and I have friggen had it with Sony products.  I don't have time for their crappy service and products.  

I hope if you have a Sony product it treats you well.

Camera was $380+tax on sale on Dec 26th 2003 from Sears.  I had them price match Bestbuy.com for $341.99 plus 10% of the difference so it was like $335 plus tax.  The rebate I was supposed to get was $50.
