            I bought this vehicle for my wife. Thinking it would be reliable.
$40,000 4W/D you'd think so.  The 2000 Grand Cherokee has NO adjustments
for the CASTER or CAMBER.  The truck has been to the dealer for &quot;Pulling to the Right&quot; since it was new.  The dealer (and other front end techs)
say there is nothing they can do because the 2000 model has no adjustments.  It still pulls to the right.
At 3000 miles both front brake rotors had to be replaced. They were warped.
The front ring and pinion had to be replaced. Making noise like crazy.
I have recently found out (www.alldata.tsb.com) jeep has issued service bulletins on these very subjects to the dealers and owners have not been notified.
The Truck is not worth the money that was paid for it.
Go spend your money on something else.
I also own a Jeep Wrangler that I am satisfied with. But move on to something else when you're looking at the Grand Cherokee.<br><br>
