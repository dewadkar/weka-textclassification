            I bought this vehicle because I loved Volkswagon, it is the third one that I have owned.  I love Volkswagon due to the experiences I have had with the other two I have owned (Rabbit &amp; Jetta). They have great fuel economy and are not very expensive.  It is usually a great car for the money.  Since I bought the car in 1996 it has been nothing but one catastrophy after another.  The steering wheel grinds.  I have had to replace the starter 2 times (each one has lasted approx 1 year).  One day when I unlocked the drivers side door the entire lock came out on my key.
I have been very disappointed with the craftsmanship of the newer Volkswagons.  The steering wheel grinds and the dealership does not know what is causing it.  Please think carefully before purchasing a Volkswagon, the craftsmanship of Volkswagon of the past is not what it is today.<br><br>
