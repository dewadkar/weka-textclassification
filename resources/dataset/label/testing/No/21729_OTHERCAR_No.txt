            When my much-abused Mustang finally died, I had to have another car, and *fast.* I was burned out on used cars, so I was looking in the lower-end new cars...

That's when I saw it. A little white Cavalier, over in the used-car lot. It had only 700 miles on it, it was loaded with options, and it was in my price range. The test drive was only a formality...I had to have a way to get to work the next day.

I've never regretted that purchase. My '98 Cavalier gets great gas mileage, and it's small enough to be easily maneuverable (handy for tight parking spaces) without being so small that I feel like a passing semi will blow me off the road. It has been very reliable, too...the only repair it's had was the fault of the mechanic doing an oil change. And it gets driven over 400 miles a week, so it's been put to the test!

There are some down sides to the Cavalier. Even though the back seat does lower to provide more hauling space, the trunk is very small, even with the seat down. And the back seat is too cramped for adults to ride in, and not easy to get a car seat into. So this is probably not the car to get if you have a family, or if you carpool with several adults. However, for a single or a couple, I can't recommend it highly enough...and it will fit most budgets. <br><br>
