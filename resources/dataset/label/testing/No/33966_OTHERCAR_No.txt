            This WAS what I thought when i bought the car, I decided to leave the old opinion so you can tell I have nothing against Mazda(s).

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I bought a 92' 929 with 110.000 miles, the car drives and looks nice, is really loaded  and has a great interior finished. I'm sure that a new car with the same equipment could cost more than $25.000, so I rather pay $5400 for this car instead of buying maybe a newer car without any luxury, this is the kind of car that you feel proud to own and drive.

I went to Orlando, FL, that is more tan 200 miles from the place I live, the car is excellent and you have to keep watching the speedometer because you don't fell the road,  easily this car can pick up more than 110 miles in a heartbeat.  My car is 8 years old but already has passenger airbag, (ABS), and so many other things that you can't find in any popular car.  I wish to get more miles a gallon and have a glove compartment or a cup holder but that's nothing comparing what you can get for your money.

Up to date I have not expend any money in a major repair, like all the cars, you have to do some preventive maintenance to avoid the major repairs, things like change the fuel filter so you won't have to expend $300 later changing the fuel pump or change the transmission fluid so you don't have to rebuilt it later.  

Maybe the next car I will buy could be a 94 or 96 Lexus 400 because after you own this car you won't feel the same comfort driving a Camry or an Accord even if you get a new or newer model.

Now is September, just had the car for about 5 months, as you can tell in my old review I'm not a racer, and I always take care of the car maintenance.  The problem started about a month and a half ago, after I filled up the thank I noticed a loss of power, I thought it was the gas, so i put a fuel injection cleaner, that work a little better and then the car was o.k. but not for long.   Then the car started to shake a lot in the traffic lights. I thought it just needed a tune up so i was on my way to the dealer (big mistake) and then the car just stopped running, I checked the engine and started to hear a tapping noise, the oil level was o.k, then I started again and a felt a big power loss in the engine again, I barely made it to the dealer.  The next day they told me that I needed a new engine, $4000 dollars and they charge me $78 to check the failure, I know that cost but in the results didn't said exactly what happened just something like
"we notice a tapping noise coming from the top of the engine", so it was like paying $78 to tell me that the car had a noise, something that I already knew.

Then I took the car to a mechanic he told me that it needs new valve lifters and that is going to cost $1400.  Right now I don't want to put more money into it, the transmission fells funny (and i changed the fluid recently) so I'm going to  sell it cheap to somebody that want's to fix it.

So about the car, even if you take good care of it, the car is going to come up with costly repairs, i know the mileage was high when i bought it (110.000), but i have seen a lot of cars with more miles and fewer problems.

Stay away!!!! believe in all the others readers (I didn't believe when I bought the car) unless you get an extended warranty, you'd better stay away or else is going to drain all your money.  I don't take away anything about the comfort or equipment or the looks, the car is "nice" but a "nice" car is nothing without being a good car.
