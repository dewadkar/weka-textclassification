              Purchased Dec. 98. Bought because of ride, rear seat room. My problem is when using 4WD or auto 4WD. I live in Wi. and use 4WD or auto 4WD on highway if conditions are bad. When using in either mode this truck has a loud howl which is unbearable if driving any distance and can actually feel vibration under feet. Dealer changed front differential but it didn't help. It seems a number of these trucks have the same problem. I have a couple of friends that own the same truck but dont even know when in 4WD or auto 4WD. 
  I contacted chev and was asked why I would be driving if road conditions were that bad. They said that 4WD is for intermitent use only. I took truck to a few different dealers and they each have had some come complaints about this. Chevrolet now has said this is normal in some trucks and there is no fix. Now I am in a cituation that I am suppose to live with. If I sell now I will take a big hit. Have only 5000 miles left on warranty. My concern is vibration that service people said eventually will cause something to fail. 
 Also have had many other smaller problems such as emergency brake, rear window latches, rear door won't close right when weather below 0, lots of rattles in dash.
 I currently own 6 GM vehichles in my business but this will be the last. Chev is looking for a easy way out to spare expense. If you are going to purchase one, make sure you try 4WD first.  <br><br>
