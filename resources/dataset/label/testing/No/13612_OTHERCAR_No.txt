            I bought my 2000 Model Chevy S-10 ZR2 Wide Stance to try out a Chevy product for the first time. I was raised with Fords and thought that I would try out one of Chevy's products.

I like the styling of the Chevy pickup and the look of the 4 wheel drive. It has some nice features inside like the radio volume that automatically adjusts with the speed of the truck. The heated mirrors are convenient and user friendly and make those foggy mornings a little easier. It stops about there on the things that I like about the truck.

 The mileage that was on the sticker is in NO way a reflection of the actual mileage the truck gets. I get about 10 miles to the gallon LOWER than what the sticker promised. I have had numerous problems with the truck as well.

 It has left me stranded 3 times so far with only 14,000 miles on it. The rear differential went completely out at 6,000 miles. The wiring harness has been replaced 2 times so far. The 4X4 system quit at 9,000 miles. 

The drivers door leaks...dealer says it is A OK!! Just recently it went back into the shop for a fuel injector failure at 14,000 miles. The ground wire was loose on the electric fuel pump and the truck would stall when switching from Drive to Reverse. 

The transmission has a noise in it that the dealer says is not there so I will be expecting another visit to the rental car agency very soon!!! 

I hope that this little letter serves as a warning for the potential buyers that are out there to PLEASE check into this service or your local BBB BEFORE you buy one of these trucks. I wish that I had!!! <br><br>
