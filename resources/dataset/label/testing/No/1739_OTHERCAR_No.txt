              Are the flashy looks and aggressive styling reason enough to own a Firebird?  If those are the most important factors in your decision process, then by all means, this is the car for you!  However, if you're looking for something that is a great looking car and also practical - at least somewhat - you should consider looking a bit more.

  I bought my '95 Firebird in late '96.  It was a leftover program vehicle with under 13,000 miles and over two years of factory warranty remaining.  I was looking for something sporty, but useful.  After the initial test drive, I lost sight of the &quot;useful&quot; part.  I was immediately attracted to the primary red paint scheme, aggressive stance, tight handling, acceleration, and responsiveness of the car.  It is indeed a very fun car to drive on a flat, open road!  I would assume that is the biggest selling point.  Once the accelerator is pushed to the floor and inertia has pinned the driver to the seat, all thoughts of practicality are suppressed by adrenaline.  Sadly, this is only temporary....

  After the initial honeymoon period with the car (about a week), I started to rethink my purchase.  

  I quickly learned that those cool t-tops aren't so cool when its raining.  They leak during moderate to heavy rain showers.  After asking the dealer and consulting the service manual, I found out that this is normal - according to Pontiac anyway.  To me, it is not &quot;normal&quot; for a late-model vehicle to leak.  Mine is not a rare Firebird.  Every one with t-tops will leak from day one if left out in the rain or driven through an automatic carwash.  If parked on a downward slope with the nose of the car facing downhill, all of the water that leaks in will collect in the driver's and passenger's floorboard areas.  I have yet to have any water collect anywhere when parked level or facing uphill, however.

  That brings me to the road noise issue.  In my case, it is amplified by the t-tops, but I have ridden in other late model Firebirds without t-tops and the levels are almost as loud.  At highway speeds, it almost sounds like one window is halfway down.  At times, it is difficult to talk over.  You will hear a constant, steady rushing sound from the wind rushing underneath the vehicle.  You will hear a moderate whine from the factory Eagle GA tires, which is lessened somewhat by replacing them with a touring type tire.  (by the way, you will be replacing those GAs very soon.  Mine were in very bad shape at 15,000 miles, and would not pass a state inspection at 18,000.  This is with normal, adult driving.)  The last sound you will notice at highway speed is the engine purring.  I can't say this is definitely a bad thing.  You buy a sportscar, you expect to hear that &quot;throaty growl&quot; from the engine.  You will hear it.  All the time.  Very cool sound during a test drive, but rather mind-numbing on a long trip.

  Next we'll go over the interior.  There isn't one - at least not much of one.  First thing you'll notice is that most of the passenger compartment is filled by dashboard.  The front bucket seats are just about the same ones the Firebirds and Camaros have used since '82.  They're fine for the commute to work, or to run to the post office, but you don't want to be in one of those seats more than 20-30 minutes.  You sit very low in the car.  Your legs are almost stretched out, with a 15-25 degree angle bend in your knees.  That puts a lot of strain on your lumbar region, and those nice hard seats have a curve to them that offers almost zero lower back support.  That's the driver's seat - and its the good one!  The passenger is faced with the same arrangement, but with the added bonus of a &quot;footrest&quot;.  This &quot;footrest&quot; is a hump in the floor to allow for the catalytic convertor's heat dissipation.  It requires the passenger to sit almost twisted, with both feet as far to the right as he/she can place them.  Very uncomfortable even for short trips.  I didn't realize how bad this was until I accompanied my mechanic on a test drive of the car recently and rode in the passenger's seat.  I quickly learned why all my friends volunteer to drive everywhere we go.  The car also has two bucket back seats, but as far as I can tell, those are for display only.  Maybe small children will fit back there, but the seats are so uncomfortable, no child will tolerate them without an excessive amount of fidgeting and complaining.  The last hit on the interior is the cup holder.  Any new car sold today has cup holders built in somewhere.  Most actually work well and are designed to accommodate a variety of travel mugs, fast food cups, etc.  Well, your Firebird comes with one mounted in the center console.  Its nothing more than a cylinder in the molded plastic.  To make it accommodate various sized drinks, Pontiac includes this rubber sleeve that loosely sits there.  This is not at all functional.  If the car is moving, hold the drink in your hand or between your thighs otherwise, you will be scrubbing coffee from the floormats and passenger seat Saturday morning.

  Driveability.  What an all-encompassing term.  You hear it all the time in car commercials.  Bet you don't hear it too much in the workgroups of Firebird designers.  This car is fun to drive for a very short while, until you notice how hard it is to drive the car - safely anyway.  Once you look past the enormous dashboard to see the road, you realize you're looking at the road a good 15 feet in front of the car.  You can't see any of the hood.  That's the case in many newer cars, but few place the diver's posterior less that 14 inches from the road and have excessively long front clips.  I'm 5'10&quot; and sometimes have a difficult time seeing the road or judging distance (and I'm a very good driver).  you will really notice this when coming to the crest of a hill.  At that point you can not see the road at all!  not the part you are on, or what lies ahead.  You literally see horizon and are driving for a few seconds blind.  There are two busy intersections close to my house that I avoid altogether because coming over those hills and through the intersections without being able to see if someone is trying to make a left across traffic in front of me is too dangerous.  My kid sister is about 5'5&quot; and she will not drive the car.  In any seat position, she can't see out of it well enough drive, or to tell where she is on the road.  

  Storage.  Forget it.  Go grocery shopping once &amp; you'll regret buying this car.  Using the rear hatch area and backseats, you can expect to fit 4-6 regular paper grocery bags, and about 6 more smaller plastic bags.  Want that 50 pound bag of puppy chow?  Better make two trips.

  I could go on, but who's going to read this much?  Buy this car if:

     a.  You are single with no children and plan to be without children for a while.

     b.  You have a second, more practical means of transportation.

     c.  You are going through a midlife crisis and are only concerned that you have a good looking sports car. 

  Do not buy this car if:

     a.  You have or want a family.

     b.  You have more than one other person that normal rides in the car with you.

     c.  You have children of any age.

     d.  You are concerned about insurance rates, fuel economy, resale value, quality of craftsmanship, etc.
