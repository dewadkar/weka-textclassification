            I currently own a 1991 Lincoln Continental.  It has
the 3.8 Litre V6 Engine.  The engine itself is in
excellent condition but the rest of the vehicle is
falling apart.  The suspension is ready to go that is
a few thousand dollars.  I have water leakage everywhere.
And the electrical system is hay wire. I bought the vehicle
because it was only 1,500.00, can you blame me?  I will not
ever buy a Ford no matter what the cost.  Lincolns are a rip
off because they have a standard Ford engine in them.  If 
I were to spend the same money on a Cadillac, I would be getting
a Northstar Engine, and different configurations from the standard
GM engines.  So I advise everyone to look under the hood closely to see
if what your paying for could be only a few thousand in a different
vehicle with a different name.<br><br>
