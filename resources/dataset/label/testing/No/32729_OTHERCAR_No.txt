            Mazda 626, LX, 4-Cyl, AT

After looking at this car at a used lot in the Summer of '01, i was convinced that this was the car i was looking for: a strikingly sporty four door model, peppy 2.0L engine, economical gas mileage for a college student, and thousands less than a Honda.

Here i am, two years later, with a better viewpoint about why Honda's are praised and given top-dollar in the used market.  In my first couple weeks, my check engine light went on and the O/D display was flashing on my dashboard at certain points on long trips.  This was disconcerting enough that i went to Autozone for a free check-up to see what these error codes meant.

To make a long story short, i was told that i am going to need a new transmission in a few thousand miles - and that it could go out on me at anytime! (should have got the manual trans.)  After doing some research into this issue, it turns out that Mazda put faulty transmissions into their '91-'97 models, and rather than make accomadation or recall, expected their customers to foot the bill... quite the proposition when you figure a new transmission runs around $2000.  Also, repairs in general will end up costing you, a new oxygen sensor (usually cheap) will run $200 for a Mazda.  My last issue is that my A/C belt is always having alignment problems, causing a nail-screeching squeak for 10-30 secs. when the motor is turned on. 

Ok, even though the transmission and engine have their faults, Mazda did a lot of things right for the driver and passengers sitting in the car.  For being a small car it is roomy throughout, drives with ease, fits my Alpine CD player nicely, and has easy controls.  All around aesthetically pleasing and trendy inside and out.  One of my favorite features is that the seats fold down in the back to have access to the trunk, very nice.  And for gas consumption, this car isn't too bad, averaging between 20-24 miles to the gallon. 

Price paid $7,100 dollars (86,000K miles)
