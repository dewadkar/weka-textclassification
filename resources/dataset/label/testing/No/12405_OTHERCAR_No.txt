            My husband bought his used 1997 Catera in October,1999,with only 27,000 miles.  That should have been a warning sign to us.  It has constantly been at one of three dealerships who have tried to repair it since then.  We have contacted the original owner who tells us she had the same problems with tires (it has had 3 sets of tires before 30,000 miles)and alignment.  After being told again &quot;it's the tires,&quot; we took it to an independent tire dealer who has finally told us it will always pull to the right because the frame is bent!!  This car has never been wrecked.  We have been told by their own service techs that bent frames and alignment problems are common with Cateras,but Cadillac will not own up to anything.  We have also had to replace the transmission as well as the alternator.  We continually have problems with door locks, radio, a/c, and warning lights coming on. After having the car in the shop constantly for over a year now and hardly any of the problems solved, we are seeking legal action.  If anyone has anything to offer that would be helpful we would appreciate it!<br><br>
