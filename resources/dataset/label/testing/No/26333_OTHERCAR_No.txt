            This vehicle was purchased new and nearly loaded.  It is the LS model.  I'll start this review with the positives and then cover the negatives.

Let me start by saying that I live in Western Pennsylvania.  Throw rain, snow, sleet, hail, winds, or ice at the Astro and it goes without flinching.  

The V6 engine has plenty of power for acceleration if unencumbered or for towing reasonably heavy loads.  Our van has the heavy trailering package, and we've never had problems being able to tow a large load.  Highway mileage isn't bad for a vehicle of this size.  Admittedly, 22-24 miles isn't anything to write home about, but it's not bad for highway mileage.  Unfortunately, we only get about 16-18 mpg in the city.  Stop and go driving is a real killer on economy.  As far as the engine goes, the vehicle feels powerful and will accelerate quickly if needed.  The 4-speed automatic is sufficient, but an optional 5-speed manual would have been appreciated.  Chevy did not make a 5-speed for this model.  At this point in our ownership, we've had no transmission/engine problems to speak of.

The seats are amazingly comfortable for long drives.  This vehicle has been driven to New Mexico and back home to Pennsylvania.  It has also gone to Wyoming/Yellowstone National Park area on a separate trip.  Both times, the trip was quite tolerable.  Between the front seats is room for a small (9") TV/VCR, and we have fashioned a wooden box to accommodate this purpose.  With a simple cassette-tape adapter, the sound can be played over the vehicle's stereo system.  We have the premium sound package with premium speakers, CD/cassette/AM/FM, and rear headphone unit.  The stereo handles full ranges of sound with gusto.  Rock and Jazz sound particularly good over the system.  Climate control is also great.  Independent front and rear AC/heat allows for different comfort zones within the vehicle.  The heat takes only a couple of minutes to kick in after a cold start.  There is one cigarette lighter and 2 DC power outlets in the front, plus one in the rear.  This totals four car adapters that can run at once, even if the car is off.  You don't even need accessory mode to run auxiliary power.  Finally, interior lighting is a real plus.  Interior lights are placed in the ceiling and 4 of them can be rotated and switched on and off independently of the whole system.

Now for some negative aspects of this vehicle:
First, tire wear is terrible at best.  Our first set of tires barely made it to 10,000 miles.  We learned that the stock idler arms in the front axles were of poor quality.  I recommend idler arms made my Moog.  With the new idler arms and obsessively careful tire rotation, we can almost squeeze 30,000 miles out of 75,000 mile large-truck tires.  Not what I'd call great, but understandable for this chassis.  The chassis is the same one that is used for the Blazer, which is much lighter.

Second, an annoying problem: the rear doors don't stay open.  Regardless of incline or other conditions, at least one of the two large rear doors will slam shut while open.  This is disturbing.  We keep two cubic foam blocks in the back.  These are shoved into the door opening to prevent this problem.

Third, the vehicle places great strain on the electrical system.  If you have the radio on for 2-3 hours, expect a battery to dead to crank the engine.  In our case, this is due to the premium sound.  Also, if you leave interior lights on overnight, expect a dead battery (other vehicles I've experienced have at least enough juice left for a few cranks.  The Astro's dome lights will totally kill the stock battery in about 10 hours.)  I recommend buying the largest capacity battery you can find for this vehicle.  Also keep a working pair of jumper cables in your vehicle (although this is just good common sense for any vehicle.)

Fourth, the front axle (and maybe the rear, I'm not sure) are notoriously bad.  Our front axle was replaced with about 70,000 miles on it.  Since it was back-ordered, this repair took about 2 weeks to complete.

Fifth,  the driver can't keep air from blowing in his direction.  If the driver wants to cool the vehicle off, it is impossible to keep a stream of cold air off of his arms.  This is annoying while driving.  It's not a major problem, just an annoyance.

Sixth,  the vehicle has a blind spot in the rear-view mirror.  Due to dual-doors as opposed to Dutch doors, as small car directly behind my by about 40-50 feet is in a blind spot.  This vehicle is invisible in the rear-view mirror as well as the outside mirrors.  Button mirrors were added to the outside mirrors, but this specific problem is not solved.

Final problem, the vehicle doesn't sound secure.  It has several different rattles and noises that it makes.  To someone who is used to it, it's no problem.  However, for passengers that don't usually ride with me, they ask if my vehicle is about to fall apart.  It's not a real problem, but another little annoyance

To sum up, this vehicle will go anywhere.  I'm nearly convinced that it's impossible to get it stuck somewhere without getting actually caught due to low ground clearance.  The sound system is great and the vehicle is an overall champ for driving cross country.  However, there are some major and some minor problems that exist, and for those reasons I recommend against purchasing this vehicle unless you get a good deal and are willing to invest money in it.
