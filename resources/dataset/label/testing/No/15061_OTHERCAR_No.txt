            In the beggining it seemed this might be a great camera. It had resolution and allowed you to store your pictures on a floppy disk. But then you look at the true details and find that this camera isn't all that.

My biggest beef with this camera is the price you pay and the resolution you get. For the $400  + that you would spend on this camera you can get a camera from Nikon or Olympus that is better and smaller. The idea of using a floppy disk greatly hinders the ability to make high-resolution pictures. NOw you say you don't want a high resolution picture? Even the low resolution pictures seem to be lacking. The shadows get muddy and the highlights can get washed out. The overall picture is grainy and for the money seems to be missing something. 

If your main goal for these pictures is to use them as web images and for e-mail then save the money and buy a less expensive camera. They will be smaller and do exactly the same thing this camera will do. If you think using floppy disks is the best thing in the world then try taking your camera to the park with grandkids, or the zoo with kids, or on vacation with your friend. You will have so many floppy disks floating around you will go crazy. Save your self the hassle and get a camera that allows you to expand the memory and hold more information. 

Finally be wary of the idea that the name means quality and style. Sony seems to be lacking in the digital camera department. They are behind and other companies such as Canon and Olympus have taken the lead in quality for the price. Check out the Olympus Brio 100/150 if you want a simple camera only for web and e-mail. By the way if you think of printing your pictures from this camera don't expect much quality the images are small and lack detail and information.
