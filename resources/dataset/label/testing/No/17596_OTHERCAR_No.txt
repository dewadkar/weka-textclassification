            Ok this was my first NEW car. I really had my mind set on the Cavalier and I did not want a Neon. BUT... the Neon was about 2000-3000 dollars cheaper,  seemed peppier to me, and it was cute. It completely won me over, so I bought a '98 Neon Expresso, power windows, doors, power moon roof. I love how the car looks, I even got metallic purple, which is LOVELY. It drove nicely and I just loved it. 

<b>Size</b>

Although my fianc� cannot get comfortable in the car (it's far too small for him) it fits me just fine. I am 5'4 and I have no problems. It's really a smaller people car. The interior was nice, and the inside layout of buttons and things suited me just fine. Some people complained about not being able to see very well out the back window, though I have no problems

<b>Appearance</b>

I can't state much about the handling or performance of the car given my problems before. I can only say it's a cute car. The shape of it is very nice and it looks a bit like it's smiling at you. 

<i><b>about a year later though... </i></b>

<b>Problem 1</b>

I first thought it was just my car but reading the reviews I see I'm not the only one. I had to have my car in THREE times to fix sunroof problems. The first time it was &quot;fixed&quot; it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel. I think this was a part of the awful service department at the dealer I went to. 

<b>Problem 2</b>

Anyway, next problems were the oxygen sensors and the catalytic converter, whoops had to be fixed. Those went buh-bye together. I felt like the car was straining unduly and it was idling erratically. 

<b>Problem 3</b>

So this problem I find when driving on the expressway, hit the gas, go nowhere. Hmmm. Hit the gas, nowhere. Car genius that I'm not, I told the dealer it felt like the trans was slipping. It sure was. Had that fixed too. 

<b>Problem 4</b>

THEN the car started leaking oil; that was a problem with the head gasket. I was very close to burning up the engine on that one. I just happened to mention some problems to someone, and they suggested checking the oil. Whoops it's almost ALL GONE!  I ran out immediately to get more. Where's it in the book I need to check this all the time? Yikes. 

<b>Good old, miscellaneous problems</b>

The trunk leaks water, and the windows don't always seal all the way when up. They sound loose in the door. The brakes squeaked but no one wanted to fix that. When I turn it sounds like someone is hitting the frame of the car underneath and no one seems to know why that is, because whenever I mentioned it they blamed it on the trans at the time, or this or that. This happens usually only in the morning though so it's almost impossible to get anyone to hear it. I've had it die on me for no particular reason at work in the parking lot. The last two winters it hasn't always started up in the cold. It's only 2 years old and I feel like I should still be driving my 10-year-old Ford. At least I knew my Ford was falling apart. 

I think my tires came from a Hot Wheels car. There's an abnormal amount of wear on the back passenger side tire.  The tires are kept at the correct pressure. The whole car rides like a school bus; my dad says it's the tires and I should get better ones but come on!!  New tires at 20,000 miles??

As a side note, I DO regular maintenance on the car. Oil changes at 3000 miles, had the tires rotated, air pressure checked, that good stuff.  But even still I feel like I need to check all the vital fluids all the time to make sure they didn't sneak out on me again!

I wrote a letter to Chrysler in complete frustration with my car. I had someone call me back, and I felt I got nowhere. They wanted to know what I thought should be done. Give me a longer warranty! Give me a new car!!  Have someone FIX THIS STUPID THING. It's too bad the rep guy and me didn't have video phone, I'm pretty sure my eyes were flashing and I was breathing fire.  Well can't get a new car, can't extend the warranty unless I wanna pay for it. BUT he said he would call the dealership and let them know about my problems. Ok cool, went to make an appointment and the service manager seemed to know nothing about my cars history. So much for that. 

I did get into an accident at about 6 months, so I thought perhaps all these problems stemmed from that. But all these issues I've read on other people�s reviews so it can't be that totally.  

I must admit though, the car held up very well in the accident and I wasn't hurt at all. I got hit at about 40 miles an hour around the right front tire by one of those BIG heavy old cars.  The windshield fractured along the side but did not break. The wheel got caved in but the front crumpled like it was supposed to. I was lucky. 

So let's pretend I didn't have all these problems, MAYBE it might have been a nice car. Maybe I wouldn't have a searing desire to see this car go flying off a cliff.
