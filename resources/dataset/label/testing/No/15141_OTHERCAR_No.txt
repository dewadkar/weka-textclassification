            I bought my green Grand Am SE used from a dealer.  I liked it because it was smaller and more agile than what I was used to driving ('97 Grand Prix GTP).  It didn't have as much power as I would have liked (I got outraced by a Subaru station wagon on my test drive, and I don't think he was trying), but it is good considering that it is a little 4-cylinder.

Before I get into my gripes, I must praise this car for the things it does well.  I like the way it looks, even though it is kind of quirky.  It gets great fuel mileage (we've seen up to 33.7 mpg, and average around 26).  It also has decent power and cold air conditioning.  The brakes on this car are really good, even though the back is just drum brakes.  The driving position is good, and everything is within easy reach.  The gauges are nice and big, easy to read, and at night they light up in a red glow just like most other Pontiac cars.  The display also includes a tachometer, which is important to me.  

On the other hand, I really hate some parts of owning this car.  The first week I owned it, it died on me several times.  The engine would turn over, but not run.  After waiting for several minutes, it would work fine again.  This hasn't happened since the first few months that I owned it, so I hope it's done.  Since then, however, it has eaten a front wheel bearing and an ABS sensor.  The wheel bearings on this car are expensive, because they have a part of the ABS system included in them.  Those have been the only reliability problems, but there are other things I don't like.  The suspension is bad.  It rides very firmly over bumps, but doesn't handle good enough to make up for it.  The air conditioning is noisy, and it seems to rob the car of any real power.  I have to turn the air off when I need more power to get into tight traffic.  The transmission also acts badly when the air is on.  It lets the engine rev higher before shifting to make up for the lack of power, but that makes for a "jerky" feel.  

My lasting impression of this car is that it just wasn't made to last beyond 100,000 miles.  If I had to get another car right now, it would be an exact replica of my other car, a 1989 Pontiac Bonneville.  That car has 115,000 miles, is dead reliable, handles decent, and is quiet and comfy.  Please read my review of that one if you want to know more.
