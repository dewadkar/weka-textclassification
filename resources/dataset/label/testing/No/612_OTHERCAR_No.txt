<TEXT>
            I literally live in my Sentra at times...I commute an hour back and forth to work...I bought this vehicle because of Nissans reputation..and my first hand experience &lt; my first car was a Nissan&gt;...
Literally, the only thing I hate about this car is the over drive light...It will stay on when you are not in overdrive...It took some getting used to...
driving the car is wonderful...I get great gas milage &lt; especially with the overdrive&gt;...it is a tad sluggish getting onto the freeway...but Im happy with it...
I recommend this car to anyone who wants a dependable mode of transportation...not the people who want a super hot rod...<br><br>
