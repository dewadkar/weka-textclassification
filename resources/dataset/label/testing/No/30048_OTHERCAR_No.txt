            Before I bought this camera, I read the reviews on CNET and here at epinions. The common opinion was that this is a great camera. Wow, was that wrong.
The main reason I bought this camera was to take pictures of my daughter, so I could instantly mail the pictures home to my parents.
The bad news came right during taking the first pictures. Every time I pressed the shutter to take a picture, it took about 1-2 seconds until the actual picture was taken. This resulted in pictures of my daughterï¿½s top of the head, the sides or any other undesirable position that was NOT in the viewfinder at the time I took the picture.
Even if the object photographed was still, the taken picture did not resemble what you saw on the LCD screen (i.e. sides were cut off).
After finally taking some good pictures (1 out of 10 tries, I hooked the camera to the PC via the USB connection which worked fine. However, when I saw the pictures, I realized the resolution was pretty bad. Taking the pictures in e-mail format or with the full 2 Megapixel resolution and then converting it to an e-mail appropriate format didn't show a difference. I have better quality having my regular camera pictures digitized and reduced to e-mail format.
After 4(!) hours my batteries were dead although I had all possible power-saving features turned on. What a waste!
The only good point about this camera is that it is easy to use and you can quickly go through the menus. However, this does not compensate the pain it takes to take good quality pictures. I returned the camera after a few days.

The idea of digital photography is great, but this camera is definitely not one that keeps the promises it makes.
