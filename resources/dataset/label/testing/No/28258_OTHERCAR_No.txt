            My husband is a loyal Dodge customer.  After 2 trucks, 1 Jeep Cherokee, and 3-4 wheelers from the Dodge dealership, he talked me into the new Durango.  We bought a 1999 4 wheel drive model and thought we loved it.  It is very roomy on the inside and has a sleek sporty look to it on the outside. 

We had no idea how much gas it would use.  We have figured that most of the time we get 12-13 miles per gallon at best.  We even took it back to the dealership and told them there was something wrong with it.  They gave it back the next day and said it was perfect, that in order to get the 18 miles per gallon you had to keep your speed under 65.  That is fine in the city, but we live in the country and have to drive hours to get anywhere.

We plan on trading it in soon on a more economical model.
