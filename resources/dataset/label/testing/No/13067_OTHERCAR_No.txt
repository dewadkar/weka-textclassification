            Despite doing a great deal of research before purchasing the new 2000 Isuzu Trooper LS, I was unaware that it was a lemon. It began with a little rattle under the vehicle, by the muffler.  The little rattle gradually began to get louder when it reached about 100 miles on the odometer.  I took the vehicle into the dealership where I had purchased it and asked that they fix the rattle (which now sounded like a cow bell).  The dealership put a new muffler on, hoping that it would fix the problem.  It seemed OK, but after a couple of days - the metal on metal clanging reappeared.  Once again, the dealership replaced the muffler, however, this still did not fix the problem.  Apparently, this is a known characteristic in all of the 2000 Isuzu Troopers and Rodeos - the noise is by design and it stems from the muffler and heat shield connecting.  Potential buyers do not notice this problem on the test drive.

Another problem with this vehicle are the tires - the tires are constantly losing air.  Every two days we have to stop and refill the air in the tires.  Even though I have taken the vehicle to the tire dealership on two separate occasions and it is very apparent that the tires are losing air, they tell me that there is nothing wrong with them and to bring them back if I have any more problems.  A couple of days later, while driving on the freeway, one of the tires blew out.  

Just a little advice, if you do purchase this car - take into consideration that you will have to replace all of the tires, because they are very poor quality. 

Also, we just took it into the shop because of a recall - apparently, the TOD (torque on demand), was causing fires in the fuel line in front end collisions.  <br><br>
