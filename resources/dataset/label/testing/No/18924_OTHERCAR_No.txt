            I thought I was the coolest thing when I got my Tracker. I bought it used when My old Honda Civic I had finally died after I dogged it for a few years.  After a month or two the inside of it started falling apart.  he vent covers fell off first then some bittons followed by knobs.  ^ months later I was in an accident.  Now mind you I was stopped when my boyfriend accidentally hit me from behind.  He was only going 30 then he slammed on his brakes so he couldn't have been doing more than 20 when he hit me.  The back of the jeep smashed into the tires.  I also rolled into a car in front of me and completely smashed up the front running into a BMW.  This jeep shashed up like it was made of tinfoil.  It had to be trashed, nothing could have been salvaged.  It was a fun car and taking the top off was really cool, but this is one of the most unsafe vehicles.
