            We recently came upon one year of ownership with our CRV-EX 4wd model in the deep blue.  We were surprised a lot of its build logic and qualities weren't exactly of the Honda caliber to which we were accustomed.  We have owned a new Accord every 2 years since 1980, and were somewhat disappointed at this first attempt at a compact SUV from Honda.

We hear the CRV is akin to the first-year Odyssey minivan; whereas Honda made a last-ditch attempt to come to market with a model that wasn't exactly up to standards with its faithful buyers.  The second year Odyssey was a great improvement, and we hear shared only its name with the first year attempt.  We hope the second generation CRV will be similar in effort.

Many quirks, we hear are because of the CRV's similarity to the Civic model, we did not find appealing are:  1) The lack of a door lock control on the front passenger door, 2) The odd placement of the driver's window control buttons on the dash instead of on the door, 3) The lack of a clock recall button for viewing time even when the CRV is not in the on or auxiliary key position, and 4) The lack of a spray type (as opposed to its current &quot;dribble&quot;) window washer for the rear gate.

While we were assured its engine was derived from the 1989 Prelude engine and would perform sufficiently, we were not satisfied with the CRV since it lacked passing and on-ramp power.  Also, the bus-driver-type steering wheel position took some getting used-to.  The column shift was a bit odd from Honda but in light of the fact that driving height/floor height are so polar, we couldn't see having an 18-24&quot; shift lever.

The exterior is typical Honda:  Paint quality excellent, panel clearance and &quot;fit &amp; finish&quot; are superb and it looks somewhat attractive in comparison to other compact SUVs that are available.

The interior is great; save:  1) The extrusion plastic/cloth adhesion ceiling panels which we thought looked cheap, 2) the short seat length on front seats which we found particularly troublesome for our passengers over 5' 10&quot;, 3) and the lack of vanity lights in the vanity mirrors.  Interior noise is a bit loud while on the highway, and highway extension/dividers are stiff compared to an Accord.

The built-in, pull-out card/recreation table from the rear cargo area is a nice touch and we have used it on occasion, as well the cargo hook on the swing-out door was great for myriad uses.  The built-in reservoir could use an internal drainage spout.

We think we may have wasted money on a 4-wheel drive model.  We have found no instances here that would warrant what Honda calls its &quot;automatically-sensing&quot; 4-wheel drive system.  With the lack of a low ratio for climbing or descent on steep inclines or in sand/loose dirt, we would be hesitant to use this anywhere except paved tar.

All in all, the CRV is a great around-town, grocery-loading vehicle that young families or single semi-active individuals might find appealing.  Basically, even though our dealer has frowned on this comparison, we believe the CRV is a 4-wheel drive Civic wagon.  And now that we hear the Civic wagon is on its way back into the model line, we wonder what parts may be shared.  We are Accord drivers, and so the CRV is on its way out to be traded up to an Odyssey, but it was not an unpleasant experiment in owning the CRV.

Anyone who expects Jeep-like off-roading capability, or Navigator-style enormity should NOT buy the CRV.  But someone who thinks the RAV-4 from Toyota is too small and the Nissan XTerra too industrial should look at the CRV.  We stand by Hondas and while we have found a lot of what is offered in the CRV to be first-year, experiment-type decisions, we believe a better CRV may be on the way.<br><br>
