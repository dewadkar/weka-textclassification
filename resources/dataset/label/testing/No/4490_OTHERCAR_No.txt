            My husband and I decided to purchase our 1998 ML320 as we required more room for our two children.  We thought that we were upgrading from a BMW 325i but were dead wrong. The ML320 has nice styling and a large Mercedes symbol adorned on the front to let everyone on the highway know you own a luxury vehicle. But the view from the inside of the ML320 is much different. Among the many disappointments are the lack of child saftey features such as rear safety locks. Within two months the passenger side cup holder broke, the door locks failed, and the blades on the windshield wipers needed to be replaced. The CD player skips frequently as the vehicle has a rather &quot;shaky&quot; ride, the bolts on the tires rusted, and the air conditioner blows hot air when moving in reverse. The ML320 performs well in bad weather conditions such as snow but overall is disappointing. 
We are looking forward to trading it in and are interested in the BMW X-5. Maybe these problems were a result of the first model year but I cannot say for sure. I may never purchase another Mercedes-Benz based on my experience with the ML320.<br><br>
