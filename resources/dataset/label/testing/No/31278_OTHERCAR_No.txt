            1999 Toyota Tercel

Specs at a glance:
V4
1.5 L, 93 horsepower

Exterior:
For an economy car, the Tercel has its own unique style that marks its own character but yet is functionable for a variety of needs. I had the silver color which changes depending on the lighting at that time of day. During the day it looked sky blue and at night it looked grey. However, I regret the fact that the styling has not changed considerably from much older models. I�ve had people mistake my Tercel for a 91� Tercel. I see the resemblance. And I don�t mind the plastic unpainted trim on the side and bumper. It adds character. Also, parking this car is a sinch!

Interior:
The seats can be a bit stiff and I find the triangle-patterned fabric very tacky! However, there is ample room in the front but not recommended for a tall person. The back is slightly cramped and should only be intended for 2 people. The controls and instruments are fairly straightforward and user-friendly.

Driving Experience:
The Tercel tops off at 130-140 km/h. I pressed the accelerator all the way down and could not push it any further. Also, this ain�t no off-terrain car. I�m surprised it last through my backyard gravel alley. Braking is also horrible. You have to hit the brake pedals fairly deep to get any reaction. Often times, I do not feel safe in this vehicle. I feel like it will fall apart at times. As for safety, I�ve been in a car crash and it took the hit well. No injuries or major damage to the car. (Whereas my new Infiniti gave me major damage and whiplash) The Tercel is also fairly noisy and not a smoothy ride on highways. Not to bash the Toyota Tercel with what I�ve said so-far, but looking on the bright side of things, it�s a point A-B car that gets the job done satisfactorily. For a car that price I definitely don�t expect much out of it which is why I love it! Acceleration is great. There is not much hesitation when you press the gas and I think it accelerates better than my slow Infiniti. I love the steering as well. It isn�t stiff at all. If you�re a Tercel driver you�d understand when I say � It�s an easy car to drive.� There is no speed-sensitive steering, nor ABS, nor electronically-controlled engine getting in the way. Sometimes all that stuff gets annoying which makes the Tercel hassle-free.

Overall
I�ve become attached to this car during the year and half that I drove it but I don�t miss it. Although I miss the memories of weekend trips to Banff I never liked the �oh my gosh, it�s gonna fall apart� feeling. The car feels like there are lose screws and the engine noise doesn�t make it any better. However, the Toyota Tercel has character. It reflects a certain individual that loves to have fun, is easy-going, and cute.
