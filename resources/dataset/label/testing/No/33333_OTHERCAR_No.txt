            I inherited this vehicle from my Dad who thought it would be great to have a mini-van. He bought it new and had the transmission replaced twice while he owned it. I have had it 6 years and have also replaced it twice. It is ready to go again, which brings me to researching other vehicles.

The air conditioning has not worked properly in the last 6 years. I have had it tested and recharged numerous times with no luck until this year, when it mysteriously started working on it's own?! The rear a/c has never worked. I also have to tap on the panel to get it to light up at night.

I replaced 2 of the hubcaps at $95 a piece from the dealership. A used hubcap dealer told me they are one of his best sellers as they ALWAYS fall off. I bought a whole set from Target for $14 two years ago and they haven't budged.
The seats weigh like 100 lbs each. A lot of fun to take in and out as you can imagine!

Numerous problems with cv joints, shaking front end, it goes through at least one set of tires a year!

The list could go on for an hour!

LEMON LEMON LEMON!
