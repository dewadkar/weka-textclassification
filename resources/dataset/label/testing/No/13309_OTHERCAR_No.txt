            I did dearly love my first car, a well-kept 1990 Passat GL with automatic transmission.  The car was in great shape when my mom, who bought it new, sodl it to me for the reasonable price of $3000 in 1997.  That was the worst 3 grand I'll ever spend!

Now, don't get me wrong.  This car has served us faithfully through thick and thin.  Back in 1990, it was a family hauler.  By 1995, my brother and sister had moved out, so it was a commuter car.  When I got it, I treated it like every ounce of the 'sport sedan' they touted it as, and it delivered!  A crisp ride, great throttle response, and roomy interior made it perfect for zipping my friends around the windy, hilly roads of upstate NY.

However, the car had it's share of problems.  Too many if you ask me.  They started shortly after we bought the car, and the majority of them were simple electric failures.  The power seatbelts failed on us at one point.  The 'your keys are in the igintion' bell failed THREE times, and the last time we just ignored it.  fuses tended to blow often.

Once I got the car, it just escalated.  I'll have to hand it to that 16 valve 4-cylinder engine, it could really take a beating.  I pushed this car to its limits (and beyond, at points) in my innocence as a junior driver, and it just kept going.  At one point, I was driving with a majorly dented oil pan, so dented, in fact, that you could see the impression in it where the oil pump was.  I drove it like that for two months, and it didn't even hesitate.  When the automatic transmission failed around 110k, i drove it for 3 days with only 3rd and reverse.  The sad fact of the matter is, too many little things went wrong with the car, from a bad throttle cable to lifter rattle.

There are some very nice points about this car.  Its interior stlying is very ahead of its time.  Sit inside, and you feel like you're sitting in something circa 1995, not 5 years earlier.  The dash is laid out nicely, with climate control knobs large and easy to find without taking your eyes off the road.  It is apparent even in the early models that the Passat conveyed a feeling of luxury to the driver at a price that didn't require a luxury tax.

Perhaps the bet thing this car ever did for me was give me $4000 when I toatled it in late 1999.  I admit that it wasn't worth that much, but my insurance company wrote the check.  The first-generation Passat, while a benchmark in the evolution of VW's in the '90s, is not worth the $3000+ you'll have to pay for a model in good shape.  Go for the second generation Passat, which is much more reliable.  In this case, the company actually did learn from it's mistake.<br><br>
