            I test drove this beast at the local Chrysler recently.  I was initially attracted to the stylish exterior and interior.  However, you'd think this little roadster would like its ancestors have a bit of pep under the hood.  Not so, this was a gutless ride which was an embarrassment to the history it represents.  

Built on the neon chassis, it doesn't have much difference in the handling either.  The trunk space has been sacrificed for the roomy back seat.  You can pull the rear seats to regain your trunk space in a pinch.  Forget about taking the children out picking up groceries on the way home, unless they like ice cream on their laps.

If you like a neon, then you'll like the cruiser.  If you want a sports roadster, buy an old ford and get the flatop v8's working like the real guys.
