            I bought a brand new 96 cavalier coupe back in 96 and I wouldn't recommend it.    My sister has a 96 cavalier LS and my friend has a 95 z24 so I know a lot about these cars.   They both had similar problems with their cavaliers. I feel bad because they bought their car's because I told them to buy it.   At first the car was great.   I do admit that the car looks good in coupe form.   Not to long after I got it, it started having problems.    It stalled once and I took it in.  The dealer of course didn't find anything wrong.   Then my muffler started rattling around.   My cavalier now has 60,000 miles and it still rattles around every time I make a complete stop.   It makes my car sound cheap and crappy.    The dealer said it was normal and wouldn't fix it.   Then my car started stalling again.   This time I had to have it towed back to the dealer.   It only had 15,000 miles at the time so I was getting worried.  The dealer replaced the catalytic converter this time and it hasn't stalled since.  One thing that I noticed was that the motor mounts are not strong enough.   If you floor the gas pedal, the engine slides forward in the engine compartment. Definitely not good.  My automatic transmission has been making grinding noises since it had 20,000 miles on it. The one thing that I hate most of all about the car is that the interior rattles more than any other car I have ever owned.   It's loud, really loud.   I have the base engine and I feel that for most drivers it's alright.    I drive my friends z24 a lot and it only feels faster past 75 mhp.   The car was cheap and it had a lot of options, but in the end I wish I would have gotten a civic or another Asian car.   For one, the resale value of the cavalier is horrible.   My fully loaded 96 cavalier coupe is only worth $4,000 with only 60,000 miles on it.   A civic is worth twice that and was only 2,000 more originally.   I would recommend this car to anyone that is poor and can't afford an Asian car.<br><br>
