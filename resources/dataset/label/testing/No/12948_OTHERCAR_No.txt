            I bought a used 1997 Chevy Malibu last April.  Fortunately for me, I no longer have it.  I bought this car because it was not only affordable, but it looked cute...and seemed to run great. 

I loved the fact that it had a V-6...and I was incredibly happy to have such a nice FIRST car. However,the second day I had the car I noticed a strange noise when braking...and I took it to the dealer who changed the brake pads (it was all downhill from then on).  Pardon me if I am a little dramatic. 

To make a very long story short...I had a very nice looking car on the outside which was rotting on the inside.  Throughout the course of 10 months, I had the car repaired 11 times for brakes, internal computer malfunctions, not starting in the morning, brakes again, a malfunctioning heater, 4 warning lights coming on the dashboard at the same time, and again...brakes.  

Through little or no help from Chevy, I brought my case to court and eventually won all my money back through my state's Lemon Law.  
I do know for a fact that this year of Malibu has been known to have problems...and there have been two recalls so far.  

I simply hope that Chevy has changed the way the make their new Malibus.  <br><br>
