            I upgraded to this after buying one of the last S100's available. (My S100 wasn't working right, so I had to exchange - blessing in disguise).

I really enjoy using this little camera, it has almost everything that one would expect in a camera, plus little features that you didn't expect. Canon's software bundle is really very nice, and extremly easy to use.

Picture quality has been excellent on the S300 (S100 had some problems, but if it was working, I would assume the same) and operation of the camera is quite simple once you have used it for a little while.

I don't think anyone would be disappointed in the results, compared to most 35mm or APS cameras. With the only exception here being in dimly lit conditions, then the camera is very limited....

It also has the ability to go under water with the optional underwater case.

Picture quality is really very good and I have experimented with printing the pictures (8x10's in my office now, and unless you go nose to nose you couldn't tell they were digital!! - Lexmark X83 and photopaper), putting them on a Video CD to watch on the DVD player & TV, etc. and all work really well. (Some require additional software)

There were only a few things that I think could be better:

1) Canon should include a small case, they do with thre $250 dollar APS Camera, but not there $850 Digital...
2) Battery life could be better, but is a improvement over the S100 (Same battery)
3) AC Adaptor should come included.
4) Movie mode (larger files) with no support for the type II compact flash microdrives!!!!!! Dumb, really dumb....
5) VERY LIMITED indoor low-light use. Have to be pretty close to the subject.

All features on the camera work well, and other that a few minor disappointments above, I was very happy with the camera! But as with everything you always seem to want more. I figured after spending this much on a Camera, I had better get somehting that can truly do everything that I want so I traded yet again for the G1 (Close to the same price at the time becuase the G2's were just about to be released...)

As with most if not all Digital camerad on the market, all acccessories tend to be extra, and tend to be pricey. This is not in any means uncommon, but is really inconvient.
