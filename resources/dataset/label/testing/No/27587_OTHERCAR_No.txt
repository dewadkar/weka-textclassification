            This car ran great for a while-yet within 2 years, electrical problems started.  The alternator keeps having to be replaced often. Bells would "ding" but you would have no clue why, no messages would appear anywhere-so it was a guessing game.  My car has a "traction control" feature.  This worked for about 1 year.  When we would take to dealer, they could never seem to fix - ever.  So we finally let it go.  Also, parts of the interior door would just come loose, and the console was also coming apart.  We take extreme care of our car-so this was not something that we as owners were doing to the vehicle.  This was merely poor craftsmanship.  At 105,000 we had to have the transmission rebuilt, new power steering system, and new brakes, and now at 130,000, we just had a rebuilt engine put in. I realize this is an older car with lots of miles, but way too many things were going wrong within 2 years of purchase.  I will never have another Pontiac Bonneville again.  Incidentally, the Grand Prix (1985) model that I traded in for the Bonneville had 110,000 miles, and ran great.  I just wanted a bigger, and "better" car.  I should have kept the Grand Prix-it never had problems-even with the high mileage.
