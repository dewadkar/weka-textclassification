            Many Jaguar purists have been concerned, and rightfully so, that Ford�s recent acquisition of the Jaguar brand would mean a watering down, or all-out loss of those things that make a Jaguar a Jaguar.  Certainly no one would argue that Jaguar has been an industry leader in reliability, but Jaguar cars have always had a certain something that makes them unique.  Owning a Jaguar has always been about so much more than just driving a car. The question is; does the 2002 Jaguar S-Type live up to the Jaguar heritage?

Perhaps due partly to Ford�s influence, or perhaps due to changing market conditions, Jaguar has recently realized not everyone can afford a $60,000 - $100,000 car.  Both the S-Type and the all-new X-Type are Jaguar�s attempt to build market share from the ground up. Now aspiring executives and future Ovitz�s can have a little luxury now. The new Jaguar X-Type is priced around $30,000 for a V6 model, and the more Jag-like S-Type 4.0L is priced closer to $48,000 . So you see, there is now a Jaguar for almost everyone, and those who love the English brand can ease themselves into Jag ownership for little more than the price of a fully loaded Toyota Camry.

The 2002 Jaguar S-Type looks, for all the world, like a Jaguar. In fact the name and exterior styling harkens back the 1960s when the 1963 S-Type was a new, and quite competent sport saloon. The front-end treatment evokes remembrances of both the old S-Type as well as the XK sports cars of the 1950s. A vertically stretched grille with built-in driving lights, and two large, round headlights subtly sculpted into the front fenders all show the new S-Type to be a stylistic descendant of the original Jaguar S-Type. Ironically, in 1968, the XJ-6 replaced the old S-Type, yet the new S-Type is positioned as a slightly less expensive alternative to the larger XJ series of cars. Seems like the S-Type has come full circle. And while the XJ series of cars seems to have changed very little over the past 30 years, the S-Type is an all new car which made its debut only recently.

The S-Type is available with a 3.0L V6 or an all Jaguar 4.0L V8.  There is a sport version which boasts bigger wheels and no chrome trim plus the CATS system. An optional navigation system is available as is voice activated communication system. Also available is a cold-weather package with seat warmers and rain-sensing wipers. Thankfully, the Jaguar S-Type is rear-wheel drive.

Inside the new S-Type there is evidence of  a Ford influence.  While the front seats are firm and supportive, and wood trim abounds (as one would expect from a British luxury car), the dash area seems somewhat lacking in true luxury. Most controls are easy to find, and are within the driver�s reach. It�s not functionality, or even practicality that is lacking inside this Jaguar � it is character. 

The instrument cluster houses a large speedometer and tachometer, with the usual fuel and engine temperature gauges. Frankly it all looks as if it came straight out of a Ford Taurus. While driving at night, the gauges light up in the rather pedestrian green tint. Other luxury cars such as the Chrysler 300M or Lexus GS430 have a unique, backlit look to their instruments, that�s what one expects from a luxury car. Further evidence of Ford influence is found in the center �pod� configuration  used to house the audio, climate control, and buttons for the seat warmers. The switchgear for all dash mounted components looks and feels too much like a Ford. Also, the lack of a  wood trimmed steering wheel seems odd given that the S-Type has nice looking wood trim in abundance throughout the cabin.

A minor complaint is the lack of interior storage space. A small center console and a retractable bin mounted next to the stereo are simply not enough to hold a CD wallet or individual CD cases, sunglasses, cell-phone, checkbook, or any of other little things most of us carry in the car. In fact the interior over all is quite small � smaller than the exterior would suggest. Rear seat occupants were comfortable, but complained of a cramped feeling when getting in and out.

On the road is where the S-Type really shines. Many companies save costs by using a technique called �platform sharing,� and Jaguar is no exception. The Jaguar S-Type shares a platform with the Lincoln LS and Ford Thunderbird, but the engine, suspension and drive train are all Jaguar (if you order the V6 version of the S-Type, there are some Ford components in that engine). Jaguar�s 4.0L V8 is as smooth and powerful as ever. With 281 hp stuffed into a car roughly the size of an Audi A6, this little Jag can really move. Acceleration is very impressive.  Engine noise is minimal � under hard acceleration there is mechanical noise, but it has a pleasant and reassuring growl, lacking the �rattly� sound many lower priced cars exhibit at full throttle. Handling is purposefully sporty without sacrificing comfort. Many luxury/sport sedans sacrifice luxury for razor sharp handling, not so with the S-Type. 

Although cornering is tight, controlled and results in only minimal body roll, highway driving is still smooth and serene � it feels like a Jaguar. Order the �Sport� version of the S-Type and handling is further enhanced by 17 inch wheels and tires, plus Jaguars CATS system (CATS stands for Computer Active Technology Suspension) which automatically adjusts the shock absorbers while you�re driving. The Sport version also exchanges all chrome for body colored trim giving the car a monochromatic look.

Overall, the 2002 Jaguar S-Type is more than the sum of its parts. While it�s true this mid-size Jag does utilize some bits and pieces from its parent company Ford, the execution is clearly Jaguar � with the possible exception of the interior which feels a bit bland.  In V8 form, the S-Type is powerful and sporty without being harsh or crude. The S-Type excels in terms of exterior styling � this is a beautiful and unique looking car. 

In short, the S-Type does live up to its Jaguar heritage, but like many Jags of decades past, there are plenty of quirks to iron out. Many loyal to the brand accept these �quirks� as simply an element of �Jaguar-ness,� while those who have been spoiled by the near perfection of Lexus and BMW might be a bit let down. Still, it seems only fair to recognize that the essence of  Jaguar is much more than mere words or numbers can explain or calculate. There is a certain Jaguar quality that looms larger than nuts and bolts � a Jaguar says something, it has a history and a heritage. To that extent, the S-Type has succeeded in capturing the essence of Jaguar. And for better or worse, more of us can now afford to park that �certain something� in our own driveway.
