            I bought this truck because of its flexibility. It can haul plenty of cargo, or it can haul four people with the fun of the top down and wind in your hair. There aren't many things on the market that can act as either a convertible or a station wagon - and of those, the Amigo is one of the largest and more versatile. Here is a list of highlights about its good points and bad ones. The model I own has a four cylinder motor, a five speed transmission, and is rear wheel drive.

<b>Cargo room</b>

This SUV has hauled all sorts of things. I once managed to load a 5.0 Ford V8 into it, which it was able to carry without complaining. On the other hand, the cargo area is so short that hauling a washing machine would require opening the tailgate and holding things in place with straps. I've found it's a good balance sizewise, though, as the main reason I needed cargo room was to haul car parts. It does that pretty well.

<b>Drivetrain</b>

The inline four is a bit too small for something this heavy. Acceleration is pretty sluggish, and it needs to rev a bit - cruising speed is around 3,000 RPM on the freeway. On the other hand, it delivers decent gas mileage by SUV standards, around 24 mpg for my typical driving. I have no complaints about the 5-speed manual transmission; the shifter feel is reasonably precise and the shift throw length isn't too long.

<b>Ride and Handling</b>

It's a truck, not a car. The ride is somewhat harsh and the handling is not the greatest. I think it could benefit from having a rear sway bar installed, as it has a bit too much body roll for my tastes. Then again, I think most production vehicles need a little adjustment to the suspension. Nothing wrong here; just don't buy it expecting to feel a pillow-soft ride.

<b>Interior</b>

Some people say Japanese vehicles have noticeably better interior feel than their domestic counterparts. Maybe they're talking about other brands, as I don't see it here. It's your basic gray and black plastic interior. Noting special. Then again, nothing outstandingly bad, either. It does what it should, and since this isn't really meant to be a luxury vehicle, that's what I expect. The factory AM/FM/tape/CD stereo isn't bad, either. It's loud enough that I can crank up my music over the wind noise with the top down, and isn't too bad for clarity either.

<b>Things you're not sure what the designer was thinking</b>

The Isuzu, like most things on the road, is not without some strange design quirks. For example, it has a locking mechanism on the swing-out tailgate. You have to pull on one of the links to release it. Come on, designing a door that stays open when you want it and closes when you try to shut it doesn't require resorting to things like that. The other annoying quirk is the sunroof. It has a panel that pops up at the front to keep the wind out when you remove the sunroof. Unfortunately, that panel has two "down" positions, so if you put the sunroof in wrong, the panel squishes into the passenger compartment and the sunroof isn't sealed right. That isn't really a good design in my books. And the headlight switch is kind of questionable - it's possible to accidentally turn off your headlights entirely when turning the high beams on or off. Sure, every car probably has some irritating little quirks - they're hardly things to disqualify one from buying it; I just wanted to mention what the quirks on the Isuzu are.

<b>Problems encountered</b>

I bought it with around 50,000 miles on it, and have since driven it about 10,000 more in the 8 months or so I have owned it.  I have had an oxygen sensor fail, had one inside door handle break off (this appears to have been a problem left over from the previous owner), and had the timing belt break, leaving me stranded and requiring replacing most of the engine. Luckily that was covered under warranty. Unfortunately, I had to have it towed to an Isuzu dealer for that, the nearest one of which was 40 miles away. I would recommend that before picking up anything from a smaller manufacturer like Isuzu at a used car lot, you make sure there's a place nearby where you can work on it. Aside from the premature timing belt failure, nothing I can't chalk up to "Well, these things wear out on a lot of cars."
