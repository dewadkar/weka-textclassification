            After spending 3 days behind the wheel in a 2000 Town Car Executive Series (instead of the 4 years I spent in the back seats of them), I was disappointed.

What's the problem?  Quite simply, not enough luxury.  

What's good about the Town Car?  It has a whisper-quiet V8 that gets you up to speed with little or no effort.  It's so smooth that 85mph over mediocre highway feels better than 55mph over pristine highway in a smaller, cheaper car.  In fact, this may be the perfect car if you like to speed--you can go 100mph with no effort, and no cop would ever notice you.  The leather seats are beyond comfortable, even if they don't have adjustable lumbar support (pay more for the Signature or Cartier series).  The stereo made AM traffic radio sound good.  The trunk is cavernous.  How big?  2 27&quot; suitcases, a 20&quot; rollaboard, 3 carry ons, a few shopping bags, and room to spare.  AND, I didn't pack it particularly well.

What's it like to drive a Town Car?  I should state my bias up front....  I like small cars, although I've taken to my wife's Pathfinder (http://solpo.epinions.com/auto-review-67B8-CC07A2A-39E78CB4-prod1).  They're easy to handle, easy to park, and on and on.  This isn't a small car, but it was twitchy like one.  I've driven Buicks before (no reviews--it's been a while and my memory isn't too clear) and I remember having to turn the wheel a lot to accomplish the smallest maneuver--NOTHING could make it steer or weave or anything else.  Then I drove a friend's old Volvo....  Simply brushing the wheel would send the car over two lanes (OK, a bit of hyperbole here, but it keeps things interesting).  The Town Car seemed more like the Volvo than the Buick.  I found that it took surprisingly little input to get the car to steer.  In fact, when I started driving it, I was weaving because I assumed that I would have more play in the wheel than I did.  That being said, I didn't drive the car aggressively (it was Disney roads and I-4 all the way), and, in all honesty, I didn't feel like I would want to.  You were always aware of the weight and size of the car in its handling.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and, to some extent, I liked it.  I'd say that it's targeted for people who KNOW that it's time for a Buick (it seems like all of the retirees in my area, as well as my dad, drive LeSabres), but who want something that at least seems like it's actually a car.

So, what's wrong with the Town Car, other than the mixed review of the handling?  This car isn't much more luxurious than my Nissan Sentra....  Other luxury cars have one-touch up AND down on all windows.  On the Town Car, one-touch down only for the driver.  Climate control?  Yes.  Dual-zone?  No.  Sunroof?  Well, you can lean out the window and look up.  Heated seats?  Maybe on a more expensive model.  Auto dimming mirrors?  No.  Compass?  No.  Stereo controls on the steering wheel?  No.  The buttons are easy to use--everything comes right to hand.  But they don't feel much better than a cheap compact car.  

A comment to this review asked for a review of the ergonomics....  Here's the bottom line.... With one exception (cruise control), I didn't have to look for the owner's manual, and I never ran off the road changing the AC or looking for traffic radio, even though I couldn't change the station from the steering wheel (can you tell that I was annoyed by this?).  I found the cruise control confusing, but it may just be that I'm used to it on Nissans and GM cars rather than Ford/Lincolns.  It was actually quite simple (turn it on/turn it off), once I figured it out.  One kudos for the power seats.... The controls were on the door, instead of on the side of the seat.  That made them VERY easy to reach.  

Sticker on this car is about $39,500 (with the destination charges)--that's for the base model which lacks all of the above features.  For less money, you can get an equally large and much better equipped Buick LeSabre.  If you have to have a luxury car in name, for about the same money, you can get a Lexus GS300, BMW 530i, Cadillac DeVille, etc.

The Town Car is a wonderful vehicle--it's smooth, quiet, and comfortable.  But you don't get a lot of luxury for your money.
