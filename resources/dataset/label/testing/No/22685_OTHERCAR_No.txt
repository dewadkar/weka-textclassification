            I never owned a Pontiac Grand Am myself.  But my mother bought one in 1990, (new then).  After six months, the car started to get patches of rust spots all over it.  By the time a year was up the doors were rusted on the bottom. She got an excellent deal on a new car.(she thought)It cost her more for deductibles on her insurance than anything. After two years the transmission went out.  She finally took a big loss on it after 3 yrs. of suffering. She didn't even sell it for as much as what the first five payments amounted to.

Another case is my sister, she bought a 1994 Grand Am,  After 3 months the transmission went out of it. Then her starter went out about three days after that.  Her Pontiac dealer wouldn't even stand behind her on this when it came down to writing to the company.  She also took a loss on her car, she is still driving it because the resale value is so low. She still continues to put a lot of cash into the car every year.

I guess I can't say wether or not it is the owner/operator of the vehicle, not taking care or whatever the case may be. As far as I see it, I have just seen and heard way to many true stories about Grand Am's to believe that it is a good car.

I am sure there are a few that made it out there. But probably not to many. It is a car with many hidden secrets.
