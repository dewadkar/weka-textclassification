            I bought a new 1998 Jetta in Sept of 1998.  I had heard nothing of great things about Jettas, and all VWs for that matter, and liked it during the test drive, and did some research and everything looked great... but it wasn't... not at all.  Firstly, I had a LOUSY experience with the dealer who basically treated my family and I like scum - calling us clowns, lying to us, deceiving us - and, believe me, it was more than the usual car salesman stuff people always have to deal with.  So after that horrendous experience I left with my brand new Jetta.  I was loving it for all of about one week until... my transmission blew - not even two weeks old, not even 400 miles on the car and I had to get a new transmission put in.  Give me a break.  Two months later, there was a problem with a cooling fan in the engine... a month after that electrical problems with the lights on the dashboard.  Oh yes, and I am already on my THIRD CD changer, as my previous two have ceased to work, through no fault of my own.  

My Jetta gets lousy gas mileage (I'm lucky to get 20mpg in the city) and the transmission still stinks - never wants to shift (well, it is an automatic, but still).

So I can't stand my car and cannot wait until Sept 2001 when my lease is up and I will never buy another VW again!!<br><br>
