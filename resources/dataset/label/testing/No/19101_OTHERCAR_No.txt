            i bought this car because i love suv's..i had driven a suzuki sidekick for 10 yrs, and was looking for something similiar, just a little less costly. i have had nothing but trouble with this vehicle since the day i bought it.. i was never so sorry in my life. it clunks intermittently when i give it gas, the four wheel drive &quot;on the fly&quot; means on the &quot;dead&quot; fly..you have to be going 15 mph or less, turns and backing up is extremely difficult in 4 wheel drive, i have had multiple problems with it during the six months i have owned it..i would never recommend this car to anyone..bless the people who have had good luck with this car..from the amount of kias i see at the dealership repair shop on a regular basis, i think others must share my vast disappointment<br><br>
