            Previously we owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee and were very satisfied with it passed 75,000 miles. The Jeep was a very comfortable SUV in almost all aspects. The sound system was great, its ability offroad was exceptional, the seat were comfortable (both front and back), and the features like heated seats were great. The car actually ran fairly well until it reached 75,000 miles. So I have to give the jeep some credit for its offroad ability and comfort and short term quality, but if you plan on keeping the car for a long time you might want to consider another vehicle like the Toyota 4 runner with better overall quality. If you are planning on leasing the car for only a few years I think the Jeep would be a good choice.<br><br>
