            Well, I am about a year away from paying this car off, and I want desperately to get rid of it.  I've had it since August of 1996, and I have had the same problems, particularly with the brakes, come up again and again.  This is my first car, and I didn't want to spend too much money on it.  I was a college student at the time, and I'm now in grad school.  In other words, I'm still poor as dirt.  Which is why all these little repairs irritate me so much.

The brakes started squeaking within 6 or 8 months of purchase, due to a problem that my mechanic said the Grand Am is known to have.  No sooner was that fixed than the engine began revving for no apparent reason at red lights, after shifting to park, etc.  Occasionally I had to press harder than usual on the brakes to make the car stop and hold the pedal down very firmly to keep it from creeping forward.  I must have taken it to the shop four times, and naturally, it never misbehaved there.  Finally the mechanic said he thought it was a simple electrical problem, which was expensive to fix.  Of course, he only determined this <i> after </i> the warranty ran out.  It was no great surprise to me to find out that the Grand Am's most common problems are with the brakes and electrical system.

I had to have an expensive brake job at 12,000 miles, and I'm a fairly gentle braker.  The squeaking has returned a couple of times.  Most recently a slow oil leak has developed, which I am putting off fixing because it will set me back another few hundred dollars.

There are some good things about this car.  The seats are surprisingly comfortable, and the V6 engine delivers great power.  The ETS traction control helps a lot in bad weather, but as another reviewer said it is way too easy to hit the ETS button on the gearshift and shut it off by mistake.  The ride is pretty smooth (when the engine is working properly).  It handles pretty well, though its control on really sharp turns is not the best.

By the way, my dad works for GM, which is the only reason I chose this car.  If I had it to do over again I'd buy a Hyundai or a Kia.  Not as stylish, but a heckuva lot less expensive, and Hyundai's warranty is much better than Pontiac's.

I would strongly advise against buying a used Grand Am, unless you know the owner personally.  Its reliability is not good.  There are a lot of lemons out there (just read the other reviews on this car).

**UPDATE:  A few days ago my car started making a horrible roaring noise when I braked, similar to a plane going overhead.  I took it in to the shop, and have just gotten the estimate.  I need a front caliper replaced, plus rear shoes and a few other things.  Total?  $470.  I think I'm going to push the bloody car off a cliff and be done with it.**<br><br>
