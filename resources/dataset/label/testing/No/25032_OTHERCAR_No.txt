            In 1991 I bought my first chrysler, Plymouth voyager,and liked it! Then two weeks passed and small things like screws backing out of the interior panels would be found on the carpet and I would search for where they came from to put them back in ,so I had to buy the star bit driver (it sometimes is sold like the allen wrench sets that fold up) from the local auto parts house.
  
A few days later the door ajar switch would not &quot;make&quot; on the sliding door and the service dept blamed it on a harness, also the rear view mirror fell off the windshield.  After the harness replacement, two days later the indicator light came back on while I was on vacation.  At a rest stop I found the switch plunger (looks like a door light switch) pushed it and the light went out. Removing the switch I saw that switch plunger has knurls to hold it a certain distance from the door when fully closed.  Super glue kept it from coming loose for next ten years.

One week later I had to reglue the rear view mirror. I did it myself to save time of not having the van (they always have to keep it all day or over night)which was my only family auto.

A few months later the radio led went out.

A few months later (a couple weeks short of a year) the paint started the peeling. Actually bubbles first then peeling.  A couple of weeks of complaining and finally the paint job, but only to the engine cover/hood because that was the only place doing it.

A few months go by and more peeling but on the top of the van.  Again there was a couple weeks of complaining before they would repaint.

Now their job on the hood is flaking and the sides are doing what the top did 9yrs ago.

Other problems like the A/c having a restriction in the high side line around the sensor port. This was accidently fixed ( a longer story) when the dealership tried to sell me on the idea that the sensor was faulty, but didn't know that I had already diagnosed the switch as being operational ( my background is 20yrs in a/c) and the unit was under warranty except for that switch! 

The dishonesty from the dealership is not what upset me as much as the company Chrysler not standing behind their paint.  I have another auto 20yrs old (toyota)with scratches in the paint,rust spots, and none of its paint is peeling that bad. <br><br>
