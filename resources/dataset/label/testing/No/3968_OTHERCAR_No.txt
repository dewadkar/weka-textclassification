            I don't own this vehicle myself, but I've worked as a Saturn mechanic, and myself and all of the other techs have developed an opinion of this car:  "Uh-oh!"

<b>Engine:

Fuel Economy</b> - Not bad. The six cylinder gets low 20s, and the four cylinder gets mid 20s.

<b>Performance</b> - I think the inline four cylinder (I4) has comparable performance as other I4 models in it's class.  I'd say it's very close to the Camry performance-wise, but may have a little more torque in the bottom end.  The V6 model is pretty impressive, you will never have a problem merging on the highway with this puppy.

One thing that I did not like about the V6 engine was an electronic throttle, which eliminated a cable between the gas pedal and the throttle plate.  The result?  Less moving parts, but slower throttle response.  Even the I4 has a slightly hesitant throttle even with a cable.

I didn't like the feel of the manual transmission in the I4 model.  A slower throttle response made clutch-gas timing difficult, and foot room was a problem as well.  I don't have really big feet, but I found my feet getting caught up on the paneling while trying to shift gears, often either revving the engine or stalling it.

<b>Durability</b> - After 9 years of the same old car, Saturn decided it was time to come out with a luxury model.  A grand idea, but as with most new products, the 2000 and 2001 models were full of problems.  The most noteable and frequent of them being the leaking oil coolers in the V6 engines.  We all cringed when a V6 model came in with a "low coolant light coming on" complaint.  It takes one full day to take the top of the engine apart and fix it, then another full day to put it back together, so expect to be driving a rental.

Quite a few 2000 L-cars had drivetrain vibration problems that are pretty much unfixable, but was corrected in the later 2001 models.

One plus with the L-cars is that they are equiped with 100,000 mile spark plugs.  The coils are located just above the plugs, eliminating ugly and inefficient sparkplug wires.  But they are a pain to get to, so good thing they only have to be done every 100K.

A number of cars also came in with enigmatic electrical problems, requiring many hours of labor to find the cause.

<b>Handling</b> - Handling is alright.  I found no problems with the steering, but a lot of cars came in with vibration problems: some we could fix, others we could only calm.  Company policy (and police on our test road) kept me from testing the car over 75mph, so I don't know how it handles at high speeds.  The ride is very smooth and quite, I will give it that.

<b>Interior:

Space</b> - being a mid-size sedan, space is very acceptable.  There is also a L-series wagon available, with all of the same options as the sedans.

<b>Comfort</b> - Comfort was a definite plus...the heated seats made the car a joy to work on during the winter months, and the ride is extremely quiet.  Leather is an option, and so are 8-way power seats.

<b>Controls</b> - All of the controls are easy to read and easy to find, except with the rear windshield wiper switch for the wagon.  Some cars had a problem with the silver coating coming off of the inside door handles, but it is covered by warranty (for now).

<b>Style</b> - I personally love the styling of the LS models (not the wagon), especially equiped with the alloy wheels.  Also, tinting the windows even a tad somehow enhances it's appearance.  A silver sedan with tinted windows and the alloy wheels will turn heads.

I think that the L car will be a great buy when Saturn corrects it's various problems, but the 2000 and 2001 models may give you trouble.  If you're bent on buying a Saturn, take a look at the S car, which has been pretty much perfected.  If not, look at some other sub-luxury models in it's class, such as a Lexus, Camry, or Accord.
