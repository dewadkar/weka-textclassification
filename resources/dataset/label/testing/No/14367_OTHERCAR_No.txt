            I bought this car brand new in October of 1999.  It is now July of 2001.  I had nothing but problems with it from the get go.  I may be a rattle fanatic, but this was rediculous.  In just under two years, the car sounds like it is over 10 years old with this and that rattling.  I thought that the screw on hub caps would be a plus,.... well they aren't, because rocks get caught between the hub cap and the rim, and there is no way to get them out except by removing the tire....go figure.  

The car is beautiful on the inside with nice convience features like cup holders in the back seat, sun glasses holder, map lights, CD player, etc etc.... I really enjoy driving the car with it's great steering response, but I can't afford to drive it that much with an average gas milage of 22 miles a gallon.  That is less than most SUVs....  I had a 95 Sentra before this and it got about 35-40 miles a gallon.  

Overall, I would not have bought the car is I knew then what I know now.  I would proceed with caution if considering a purchase of this car.
