            In November 1999, I bought a 2000 Volkswagen Jetta GLX. I had test driven the car in August 1999, and I immediately fell in love with it. I loved it so much that I put myself on a waitlist for six months to get it! I knew I wanted something small to make parking in the city easier. At the same time, I wanted something with a lot of luxury features but without the huge price tag.  The Jetta GLX definitely met my criteria. 

Interior: The styling is fantastic. I love the leather interior and wood trim. The heated seats are fantastic in the winter.  I don't think I can ever go back to not having heated seats.  Especially with these New England winters.  The seats are incredibly comfortable and can be adjusted in every which way.  I am tall for a woman.  With other cars,  I feel too low to the ground or my head hits the ceiling.  Not in the Jetta. The blue lights on the panel are very visible at night, and I've never had problems reading it.  The only complaints about the interior I have are the dysfunctional cup holders and the arm rest.  The cup holders are really flimsy and do not hold large cups.  A big gulp from 7-ll would never fit in it.  And forget about trying to use the cup holders when driving.  They're impossible and require too much dexterity.  The arm rest is located in the center between the driver and passenger seats.  It is quite small, and only one person can really use it at a time.  In addition, because of its location, it can get in the way when driving standard.

Sound System: The Monsoon system that came with the car is great.  In my boyfriend's car (Ford Escort), classical music sounds very tinny and rap music just buzzes.  But in my car, we can hear every note very clearly.  My only complaint is that there is no low volume.  The lowest volume level is what I listen to normally.  If I want to turn it down because one of my passengers is snoozing, I have to turn it off completely.  My friend who owns a Passat had the same complaint about his Monsoon system.

Engine and Handling: The VR6 engine has a lot of kick, and it's a lot of fun to drive.  I drive the five speed, and the clutch is a lot smoother than other cars I've driven.  The one thing I have noticed about the clutch is second gear can get choppy.  I have to let the clutch out slower for second than other gears to avoid this.  This happens when other people drive my car, too.  So, I can't blame it on the way I drive.  The engine is unbelievably quiet. Sometimes, I can't even tell if the engine is already running.  

Rain Sensor Wipers:  I am not a big fan of the rain sensor wipers.  I have noticed they do not do a good job detecting how much water there really is.  Sometimes, when I have them on in a light drizzle, they go crazy as if I am driving through a deluge.

Trunk: The trunk is huge for a compact car.  I was able to fit a book shelf in it.  The trunk lid is very solid, which is good and bad.  It's good because I know my things are secure.  However, it can pose problems when loaded down with lots of shopping bags.  It's not exactly the easiest thing to open with just one hand.

Issues:  I have had some minor issues with the car.  All of them have been of the small, annoying variety.  About six months into owning the car, the driver side seat starting wobbling and would not stay in place.  The dealership fixed this, but it took two trips.  On the first trip, they did not have the parts in stock.  Another issue I have encountered was the check engine light/emissions workshop warning kept going on in my car.  This also resulted in several trips to the dealership.  Each time, they would fix the problem.  But it would reappear again after only a week.  

Accessories: When I became a Volkswagon owner, I started getting Volkswagon catalogs in the mail.  After oohing and aahing, I decided to order a trunk liner for my car.  I called the dealership to ask if they had the part in stock.  They did indeed...for $20 more than the catalog quoted.  Being an internet addict, I decided to order it from the Volkswagon website instead.  My order went through successfully, and I thought my trunk liner would be on its way.  I was wrong.  A few days later, I received a voicemail saying the item was only available in Canada.  My order would be canceled.  According to the catalog, it was available in the US.  After that, I received a letter telling me the item was backordered.  Hmmm.  I think Volkswagon hasn't quite gotten their ecommerce act together, yet.



<b>Update 4 February 2003</b>:
I have owned the car for three years now, and my love for the car has faded.  Although the car is beautiful and very fun to drive, the high cost of ownership and multitude of inconvenient, little problems has left me yearning for my trusty old Toyota back.  After the two year free maintenance period ended, my car started riding very rough in the rain and stalling.  It cost $600 to replace a bad coil pack, which was not covered under warranty.  To add to the pain, Volkswagen just announced a recall of 2001-2002 Jettas and Passats because of bad coil packs.  Of course, I have a 2000 Jetta, which is not covered by the recall!  In addition to the coil pack problem, I have been going back and forth with the Volkswagen dealership about a bad rim that is causing slow leaks in my tire.  They refuse to believe a problem exists even though I have had TWO independent mechanics, including a trusted family friend, look at it and confirm the problem.  This is a problem that should be covered under warranty, but I have yet to get anywhere with resolving the issue.  Then, there's the issue with the rear passenger door no longer closing completely.  Water keeps getting into the car.  I can only imagine what havoc this will cause to the leather seats.


<b>Update 23 April 2003</b>:
The car was not starting in the rain again.  I brought it back to the dealership, and they replaced the coilpack yet again.  Since I had already plunked down $600 in February to fix this same problem, this repair was covered under the warranty.  Coil pack problems are very common with Volkswagens.  

<b>Update 23 August 2003</b>:
The passenger side window fell inside the door.  Three days before I left the country for vacation!  In November, Volkswagen announced they had extended the warranty for this.  Although it was fixed for free, this is just one more hassle to add to the long list!  When I called to make an appointment for service, I did not even have to finish the sentence.  As soon as I said window, the service representative said, "The window fell into the door, huh?"  Apparently, he has been getting a lot of calls for this problem.  The earliest appointment they could get me was a month away.  When I finally got my car into service, six other people were there with the same exact problem.  

<b>Update 13 October 2003</b>: The airbag light is on, and the car is not starting in the rain AGAIN.  Volkswagen quoted us $500 to fix the airbag, and they can not reproduce the water issue.  This is the last straw.  My husband and I have decided to cut our losses and get a new car.  Considering our Jetta only has 33,000 miles on it, we are a bit peeved that it did not last us longer.  But we can only take so much abuse and punishment by Volkswagen.  Never again.


<b>If I could go back to that fateful day and buy the Volkswagen Jetta GLX again, would I?  NO.</b>
