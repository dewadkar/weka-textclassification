            I owned a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Lorado for exactly one year.  That was how long it took me to realize that while these vehicles are very luxurious inside and offer wonderful off-roading capabilities, they are also very expensive to maintain and fill up with gasoline.  I had to make about 3 repairs, all of which ran me over $200.00.  This may not seem bad, however I had previously owned a Volkswagen, which cost me next to nothing to repair.  The Jeep was great at off-roading, However, I only used it for this purpose once, and was very nervous about the possibility of damaging such an expensive vehicle.  The Quadra-Trac 4 wheel drive system is great in the snow and on ice, however it is not a great every day vehicle.  You can definetly tell that you are driving in all wheel drive &quot;all the time&quot; whenever you take a sharp turn.  
The high clearance of the Jeep is also a concern when you are turning, I always felt as if I would roll over when exiting a highway offramp.  
The gas mileage was at its best 16 miles per gallon, and with gas where i live going for about $1.70 per gallon, that adds up pretty fast.  
The other consideration on this vehicle is that it costs more to insure because it is a sport utility vehicle.
The Jeep offers great luxury, however, the cons about the vehicle are what made me trade it in quickly and get a more economically and environmentally sound car.  And to be honest I do not miss the extra cargo space, because I never really used it anyway.  
This vehicle is great for men I think, I found that as a woman, trying to climb up into it with a skirt on proved daunting at best.  I could not imagine trying to get children into car seats either.<br><br>
