            We bought this truck back in 1991 from a woman in our community.  We got it with less than 80,000 miles on it at the time. Now it has nearly 170,000.  Sure, it drinks, and drips, loads of oil and isn't very good on gas milage anymore, but that truck is made like a Timex.  Presently it smokes from the wore out muffler and some other place on the engine, I have to ride the breaks when I'm at a red light, and it never-ever wants to start when it's the least bit cold outside, but my little truck is paid for and it's never let me down.  With all of its problems it's never cost over $275 at one time to repair.  Mostly it's just replacing of belts and filters, or adjusting the corborater.  

Since this truck has lasted so long with its problems, I would consider buying another Ford truck in the future.  I can't really recommend the new Rangers since I know nothing about Ford's quality now.<br><br>
