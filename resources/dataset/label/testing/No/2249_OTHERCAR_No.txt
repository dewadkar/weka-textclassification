            I bought my Tiburon brand new off the showroom floor. It's a red 1999 FX model with power everything, a sunroof and am/fm/tape/cd player. I researched the car before buying and was able to talk them down from 19,000 to 16,000 but I still feel I payed too much. This car is very impressive on first glance and of course when the tires are not needing to be replaced yet again, the car does handle well. The sound system is very clear and can be very loud. It's nice to have access to both cd and tape deck and the sunroof is operated by a button.

Now for the negatives and they are numerous. This car has the most uncomfortable seats you will ever sit in. There is a lumbar support button which changes to three positions but unless you are exactly the right hieght, it makes the seat even more uncomfortable. There is no give or bounch to the seats and they are curved in such a way as to bend you at the shoulders if you are not a narrow, skinny little thing. I have had more repairs in the couple of years than with any other car I have owned. The sunroof was jammed and needed to be replaced (I had only used it twice), The CD player froze up and stole my CD (no doubt because it is located at just the right angel from the drink holder that if you hit a bump, it's finished. The windows leak and somtimes do not close completely. The doors will somtimes get stuck in which case you have to climb in through the trunk. The power windows get stuck and you have to mess with them for a while to get them to close again. The windsheild is at just the right angel that no matter what wipers you buy, they never do the job right during a storm. Defrost isn't the greatest and the windows will fog up often during the summer on a cool day. The tires have to be rotated every 3,000 miles and if you miss this by even 100 miles they will be ruined and need to be replaced. I have replaced all 4 of my tires 3 times in the last 6 months. That wouldn't be such a "bad" thing if they were not on special rims but because they are it is hard to find a tire that will fit them that is less than $500 for 4 tires. This get's expensive very quickly. The body must be made of tin as it dents very easily; I dred what will happen if i'm ever in an accident or wind up in the ditch. The car would probably crinkle like a tin can. The exterior paint comes off very easily and the car is easily scratched up. There is no room in this car and forget about relaxing. We recently had a child and between his car seat and diaper bag we don't have room for much else and whoever is sitting in front of him will have their knee's resting on the dash. If you are not short (as I am) your head will rest on the cealing and the stearing wheel will be in your lap, as although it is "adjustable" the only adjustment is up or down one and both are close to the seat. To sum it up....I hate this car and wish I had never perchased it. I will have to pay on this car for the next 3 years and In my opinion it's basically a medal trap on wheels and would serve a better purpose sitting in a junk yard.
