            I bought my second Saturn in May.  I previously owned a 4 door SL1, which I loved to death.  It saved my life in a crash, it never rattled, pinged, or made any other distracting noise.  When it reached 110,000 miles, my husband convinced me to trade it in.  I never even considered another manufacturer; Saturn was the car for me.
I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I am with my SC1 3 door coupe.  It looks sporty, but it has absolutely no guts!  I can't get from 0 to 60 in 30 seconds, and I am not kidding!  It rattles, it pings, it makes all the noises you don't want to hear!  The comfort level is ZERO!  I am 5'6&quot;, 130 pounds, and my head brushes the top!  The seats are narrow, and uncomfortable.  The back seats are small, and tilted up, which makes them absolutely unbearable for long trips.  The factory installed stereo is passable, but the inside noise is so loud I have to blare it in order to hear it at all.  I wish I had never traded in my reliable car for this one!
As far as the &quot;redesigned&quot; console, they only made it worse.  The only decent cupholders are in the back seat!  The &quot;driver&quot; cupholder makes the rear shift unusable when it is in use!  The &quot;middle&quot; cupholder doesn't hold any cup steady, they slide back and forth in the console.  I am so disappointed in the new improved Saturn, I wish they hadn't changed it!<br><br>
