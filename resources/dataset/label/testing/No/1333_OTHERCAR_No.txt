            A friend of mine owns this poorly designed vehicle, and he constantly tells me of his fear of it breaking.  My primary focus here is on the four-wheel-drive systems included with Z-71 editions of the 1999 and later Chevy pickup trucks.

The 4WD systems in these trucks are automatic, not manual.  This means that if anything goes slightly wrong with the electrical system in the truck, such as hitting too large a puddle of water, the truck has the potential to fragment like a grenade.

Suppose, for example, you are driving this comfortable truck up a rocky hill in 4WD.  Suddenly, a fuse breaks, and your 4WD is shot.  Because it is automatic, you may be stuck in 4WD until you get to the closest repair shop (which, remember, may be hundreds of miles away) or find another fuse among the rocks to replace your burnt one.  With a manual 4WD shift, however, there are no fuses to replace: one merely changes the gear like one would a standard transmission.

So, if you are concerned about the safety of your pickup truck, do not opt for the Chevrolet Z-71 trucks.<br><br>
