            I am a Canadian and I have owned a E430 4 Matic for 4 years now and potential buyers can judge for themselves the reliability of this car.  

The salesman at MB was well trained and was truly a gentleman.  The service advisors at MB were polite and competent.   

However, the problem is the car.  I would like readers to judge for themselves whether MB quality are going downhill or not.  Here are my list of problems during 4 years of ownership:

1) At 2000 KM, Tiptronic shifter failed, car shifts to wrong gear if you use the +/- tiptronic shifter.  Dealer replaced the system.

2) At 2000 KM, Brake disc became warped and produced constant pulsation.  Dealer replaced disc rotors and pads.  At 2000 KM, I find this truly unacceptable to me.

3) At 2000 KM, I discovered the rear door to be misaligned, similar to those you expect from low quality domestics.  Dealer realigned the door.  After realignment, rear door had to be slammed in order to be shut completely.

4) At 20000 KM, Brake disc pulsation came back, dealer had to replace rear disc rotors and pads AGAIN, for the second time.

5) At 20,000 KM, Chrome on front grill was peeling off, dealership replaced the front grill.  (The chrome on my Buick lasted 12 years before they peel off)

6) At 20,000 KM, sqeaking sound start coming from Driver Front seat, when you corner, or hit the brakes, front seat sqeaks.  Dealer replaced seat bracket.

7) At 20,000 KM, Fuel guage malfunctioned and shows incorrect fuel level.  Dealer replaced the fuel guage.  This problem very common for the E Class, I know several people who had their fuel guage replaced twice.

Year 2 

8) At 35000 KM, Head lamp over heated and brunt out the whole wiring unit.   Heat was so great that the copper was exposed as the plastics were burned through.   Dealer replaced a new headlamp.

9) ABS / Traction control sensor malfunctioned.  Dealer replaced new sensors.

10) Plastic door trim became warped on one door.  Dealer replace the door trim.

11) At 41,000 KM, Rear Differential leaking oil.  Dealer will need to replace seals (or possibly the differential).
I consider this a major problem and I do not expect something like this to happen as early as 41,000 KM.  

12) At 41,000 KM, Fuel Guage failed again, Dealer replaced fuel guage again.

13) Center console light bulb failed.   Dealer charged $ 24.95 for a lightbulb + 1/2 hour labour, which comes to over $ 30 dollar for changing a simple lightbulb.

Year 3-4

14) At 50,000 KM, Ball bearing failed.  Dealer replaced Ball Bearings, under warranty.

15) At 50,000 KM, Fuel guage failed AGAIN !  Dealer replaced fuel guage for the 3rd time.   While I was at the dealer, the person behind me and in front of me were there to replace Fuel Guage also.

 
Overall, the car is very nice and is very comfortable.  But I think MB quality is definitely going downhill.  Judge for yourselves.  My service record is all in Mercedes Benz service record & computer.  All documented.  

Factory warranty has expired for my E430.  I now fear for the maintenance cost for this problematic car.
