            I purchased the Olympus 340D camera in November of 1999 for two basic reasons. Number one was that I recently reduced all of the family photo albums, over 100 years of photos, to discs and I truly enjoyed the project and was determined never to deal with processed film again. Number two was price, I researched many cameras and believed I was getting a good deal with this camera. I found out that I was partialy correct. The 340D is a decent basic digital camera but is very limited it its' capabilities. The Olympus 340D has no optical zoom and the so called digital zoom is basicly of little or no use as all it does is allow you to triple the size fo one section of a photograph. If all you want to do is use the 340D for family photos it will probably br sufficient but is inadaquate for most detail projects. The downloading of photos is slow and the resolution is poor. The camera itself is overly complicated for its limited use and the function buttons are small and difficult to operate. I often hit two function keys while attempting to take photos due to the keys being so close toegether. I even took more than one picture of one of my fingers due to the size of the camera and the closeness of the shutter to the side grips. I do not feel this is a bad product but for approximately $100.00 more, and coming down rapidly, I would recommend a higher quality camera.   <br><br>
