            I also Received this Camera Free From Verizon DSL.
Even Getting it for free leaves my Unhappy with this camera.
The Camera can be used as a stand alone digital camera or hooked up to the Computer for a web cam.
I first Took several pictures to test the camera, With thoughts of giving it to my mom for a cheap Digital camera for her to use.
After Loading the drivers onto my computer i downloaded the Images.
I must say i was not impressed I did not think it would Match my Olympus c-720, but hoped for something usable.
Unfortunately out of every ten pictures you might get two that are half decent and those still lack a lot of detail and Clarity.
The Camera need Lots of light, my pictures were under normal household light, I don't know of many people who are in the market for a camera that can take great outdoor pictures on a sunny day only.
The Pictures all seem to have a lot of pix-elation, the only ones that seems not to are those taken in the smallest file size 176X144.
I have posted some of the pictures taken by the camera and placed them on a website for you to check out.

These are not all the picture i took but a good representation of some good and some bed not counting any that were to dark to get more then a black screen.

The camera doesn't seem to focus well, and along with needing lots of light make sure you or your subject definitely are not moving.
The camera also does not have a lens cap or any covering.
In a matter of time it will become scratched and dirty, not sure how much that will effect the picture your already getting.

I did not test the software for its effectiveness in editing and sending photos, but does look like a basic run of the mill program. Their are tons of good Freeware ones on the web so i don't see this a priority for the price but a perk if it was something great.

I then started the web cam software and once again lots of light is need for a clear picture.
This one may be hard for you to do, but definitely don't move while typing, cause this camera lacks the ability to capture the movement in anything other then a Blur.
Definitely not the ideal web cam , lacking once again in focusing, Adjusting for different lighting, and lots of pix-elation in movement.

Overall the camera can capture a moment or picture to send to a friend or relative.
The only problem is don't rely on the one great shot you thought you had coming out clear.
I might be a little hard but i figure if your buying a camera to capture images , why would you buy something that can not represent them the way they were taken, which is what leads me to recommend leaving this one on the shelf.

If the price is right can be something good for the kids so they don't bug you for your 500 dollar model to take ten pictures of the dog.

Just discovered a lens cap is included with the hand strap for the camera.
This will help save the lens till it gets lost.
Still would prefer something built into the camera, but this does make the camera a little more usable in my opinion.
Now traveling and storing the camera does not risk , dirt and/or scratching of the lens.
Sorry for my over-site in not noticing this earlier.
