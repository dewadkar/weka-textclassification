            I purchased this car due to its low price and terrific 10 year warranty (5yr. bumper to bumper). I am pleased with its guaranteed reliability, but the car is either much too light or the aerodynamics haven't been thought out well. On a windy day I find myself struggling to keep the car under control at any speed. On a rainy day, don't roll down your window even a little, because there are no rain gutters on the car. I went to work with a very wet left arm and shoulder the other day. I personally don't find the seats very comfortable and the stereo lacks bass and with a window down it sounds like the balance is off. The windows fog up even in dry weather, unless the A/C is on, if the heat is used.
The combination trunk/hatchback is a positive convenience. For a compact car, there are many good options for space when carrying a load larger than normal. Gas guzzler when using A/C.
This is a good car for people with a tight budget. Luxuries are bare minimum, so if your looking for luxury, buy something else.<br><br>
