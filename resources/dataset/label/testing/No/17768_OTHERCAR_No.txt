            I did a great deal of research before I bought my Saturn.  I looked at Toyotas and Hondas as well. My biggest concerns were efficiency, safety, and economy.  The Saturn bested all of them.  I bought this Saturn SL2 a little over a year just before I got married.  My wife and our son and I could not fit in my little Nissan pickup... Well I liked the car a lot both times I test drove it.  Good power for a small car, comfortable, easy to handle, smooth ride for the most part.  Hey, its a Saturn not a Lexus, its made for efficiency and economy.  On the whole I like my Saturn a great deal and would even think of buying another one down the road.  The safety features on this car are beyond compare also.  My Saturn even took a road trip from New York to Dallas in two and a half days without so much as a hint of problems.  We pushed it to the limit and found nothing but solid performance.<br><br>
