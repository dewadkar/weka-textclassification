            We purchased our 1997 Nissan Sentra new in February 1997.  We purchased this particular car based on our experience with a 1987 Nissan Truck and a 1994 Maxima which were both wonderful vehicles.  Also, with aggressive pricing and factory rebates, the Sentra was much less expensive at the time than other cars in its class.

This car has been in and out of the shop regularly since new.  Up until 36,000 miles/three years, all repairs were covered under warrantee, but what a pain.  This car has been in the shop 5 times alone for the check engine light.  At 40,000 miles, two of the struts were leaking badly and one other was completely broken.

The seats are uncomfortable for anything but the shortest of commuter trips.  Fit and finish is ok.  Front passenger power window lift button has broken off and was replaced.  Ride is busy and noisy.  New struts helped somewhat.

To its credit, this car gets 30-35 mpg in around town scooting. Never taken it on a long trip, so I don't know highway mpg.

In summary, not my favorite car purchase.  I wish I bought a Toyota.
