            1999 just after I graduated college, I decided I deserved a reward. I had never owned a new vehicle, and all the ones I had owned were practical and conservative.  So, I decided to splurge on my 1999 Jeep Wrangler Sport.  At first I loved it: nothing beats riding around with the top off in the southeastern heat.  I loved being up off the ground...I loved the power I could feel when I pushed the gas.  

But then the top started loosening, and the noise level got higher and higher.  I can no longer have a decent conversation in the Jeep, and you can forget a cell phone.  With all the wind and tire noise, I didn't notice that it was developing a strange engine noise.  A friend who also has a Jeep got in mine and brought it to my attention.  Suddenly, all I could hear was the dreaded knocking noise.  At about the same time, all the gauges in my instrument panel started behaving strangely.  All of the gauges would drop to 0, then go back up, then back down randomly.  I took it to the dealership, where the replaced the oil sending unit to fix the gauge problem.  At first they claimed they could not hear the engine noise.  I had to get in the car with the guy and point it out.  Turns out, I had a leak in my exhaust manifold. All of this was right before my warranty ran out.  And guess what?  I believe my engine is making the same noise again, and the other day all of my gauges dropped to zero. 

I now commute an hour to work and back every day, and I'm miserable in the Jeep.  The road noise is almost unbearable, and I have to buy gas 3 times a week.  I have decided to trade it in for something more PRACTICAL.

Don't get me wrong, I love my Jeep.  I don't think the problems I've had are that common; both my sister and a good friend have the same vehicle, and they've had no problems.  I feel completely safe in heavy rains, ice, and snow.  I've had a few occasions where I'd appreciate having more space for passengers and cargo, but mostly I'm by myself anyway.  

If you commute at all, enjoy a smooth ride, have conversations in your car, are fairly tall (my 6'3" boyfriend can barely drive it), or hate stopping at gas stations, I suggest you don't buy this vehicle.  Otherwise, have fun!
