                     Where should I start on my car. I got it brand new loving my stylish sporty new car thinking everything would be fine but I was wrong. I had the car out of the show room and put two miles on it when the first of many problems occurred. I was driving along and the engine started smoking thinking that something may of caught on fire. When i was finally able to bring the car back to the dealer because it was over heating i found out that a hose from the radiator was leaking antifreeze and the hose was not attached properly. 
But the problems did not end there. 
      The car was now two months old and already the windshield wipers were not working properly. Thinking that they needed to be replaced I paid for the dealership to replace them to find out when it rained the next day that i still had trouble seeing out the windshield because of streaking. After replacing countless windshield wipers and arguing with the dealer to replace the windshield wiper arms they now work better but not as cleanly as they should.
    When the car was 1 1/2 years old i went to go use the windshield wipers to clean my windshield since it was raining while I was in class to find that the wipers now do not work at all and are stuck in the middle of the windshield. The response from the dealer is you may have to pay for it to be fixed. It turned out to be a circuit board that burned out.  
     Later that summer i was upstate visiting my grandparents for the summer. We are at a restaurant and on the way back home in the parking lot I turn on the engine and it sounds as if there is something caught under the car. Being upstate NY I shut the engine and looked. Nothing is there but when i finally get the engine turned back on it is making this horrible banging noise. The following Monday I am at the dealership yet again. It turns out that at 11 thousand miles the catalytic converter, and muffler have gone and need to be replaced. This already is four things in one year. By the end of that year i will have had the catalytic converter replaced twice and after calling general motors customer service repeatedly because the exhaust line some how rusted through with out any reason especially since the car is in a garage at night  they finally replace the entire exhaust system because the dealership tried to patch it up  numerous times. To be followed by another muffler going. What happened to the stainless steel muffler they promised on the commercials?
       As for the interior of the car at around 15 to 20  thousand  miles the spring in the back of the drivers seat popped out. The car was working fine I thought ok we had our problems. I still loved my car being my first new car.  To start to get a banging noise in the engine when i come to a dead stop in the morning that makes three bangs but no one can tell me what that is.
     Immediately following the warranty expiring I have three more problems. The tape deck stops working completely where it will not eject or play any tapes what so ever. The cyclops light on the inside of the car has already melted  twice onto the light bulb of my car causing it to explode once.  I had replaced it a few months ago and now the second one which I paid to have replaced is melting also, and from time to time the clock on the car radio will reset itself to 12:00 now this has only happened three times but that is three times too many . 
The car has only 46,000 miles and has the problems of one that is 246,000 miles.
   As soon as I can afford to I am trading this car in for whatever I can get. It will be worth it to get it out of my hair.
