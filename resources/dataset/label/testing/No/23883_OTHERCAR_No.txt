            I purchased my 95 Mazda Millenia as a lease-trade-in with 35,000 miles in 1998.  At the time, I was in love with the car because of the features - beautiful styling, power everything including sunroof/moonroof, leather, digital thermostat, 6-disc CD changer, V6 engine, wood grain trim, auto telescoping steering wheel etc.  Today, I am somewhat disenchanted with my Millenia, simply because of minor things that have not occurred with my cars in the past - Honda, Toyota and Acura.  

First, the paint job is terrible.  My Millenia is navy blue and when it is clean, it looks beautiful.  I wax it by hand and I have always kept it washed.  As another reviewer noted, road debris and parking lot dings seem to chip the paint more than on other cars I have had.  My paint job looks 10-12 years old and neglected and I feel I have done everything to try to prevent this. 

Second, legroom on the passenger side front seat.  My husband can barely strech his legs out without turning his feet sideways because the glovebox/airbag console dips so low into the footroom.  He complains about this every time he rides in the Millenia, and he is only 5'8".  Our 89 Honda Civic had much better legroom.

Third, as other reviewers have stated, the cupholders in the Millenia break very easily.  This is common with other types of cars, but nonetheless, it is annoying.

Four, the clearance under the front bumper is difficult to get used to.  I have scraped my bumper twice on curbs that are low enough for other cars to clear them.

Finally, I have had a few problems with the electrical system that may just be with my particular vehicle, but I have spent more money on non-maintenance repairs for this car than I have spent on any other car.

Bottom line:  I still love the way my Millenia looks, but I will not be purchasing another Mazda next time.  We are going back to the Honda/Acura or Toyota/Lexus families.
