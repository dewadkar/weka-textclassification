            Hmm what can one say about the Cavalier? Well in 1995, it's redesign debut year, it was thought it might have good things going for it, but that seemed to be false. Now seven years later, the Cavalier retains the same design and behavior. The standard engine, which is a 2.2 liter, 115-hp four-cylinder engine is okay, but sounds terrible if revved. The optional 2.4 liter, 150-hp Four is currently being replaced by a more pleasant 2.2 liter EcoTec Four, but this will leave the Cavalier with decreased power. The only thing good one can say about the Cavalier is that it does have secure handling, and ABS is standard. The climate-control system also works very well. Some people may favor the Cavalier's design, especially the sporty looking LS Sport sedan model, but all it is is Chevy adding as much as it can on to disguise the true 1995 vehicle. This also tends to be a trend with Chevrolet, no offense, but they tend to add as much exterior gimicks as they can, so that they can keep it from looking aged. I.E. the Blazer, S-10, and the Camaro. Drive this car and you can tell what you're driving. You're drivig a crude dated car, that is seriously outclassed by other small cars in the the competive market. The ride is stiff, and hey it's a small car, but the ride is just plain up uncomfortable, and lacks a feeling of control. The front seats are scary to even look at, and lack any kind of support what so ever. The rear is just as bad, with a sharp verticle back, and thin padding, it's barely adequate for adults. If anyone has thought about getting the Z24 version of the Cavalier, get it while you can because it will vanish by the middle of the year, being fully replaced by the LS Sport Coupe and Sedan. The car doesn't hold its value well, and even gas mileage on this small car is so-so.
