            SHAKEOUT OF THE LEGACY OUTBACK

A young aboriginal man is required to complete a Walkabout in the Australian Outback for his rite of passage.  Subaru has taken me on a Shakeabout in their 1999 Legacy Outback over the past 19,000 miles, and I'm getting a little sore and want off the ride.

Like many others, I read nothing but praise for Subaru's new line of Outbacks, that smart combination of Intermediate Wagon &amp; SUV, that gave driver's the best of both.  I took the test drives, liked most of what I saw, and made the decision to buy a new 99 fully loaded Legacy Outback.

The only thing I didn't like during the test drives was the engine vibration between 1800 to 3000 rpms.  The dealer told me this was due to tightness of the new motor and would cease after the first 1500 miles.

By 5,000 miles, the engine vibration had increased to the point where I was concerned about failure and I took the Outback to the service department of the same dealer whose salesman said, &quot;all things must pass&quot;.

The service manager agreed the vibration was quite pronounced, and asked the regional Subaru Rep. to inspect the car.  Prognosis = ALL SUBARU ENGINES VIBRATE, SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. DON'T WORRY.

I resigned myself to live with the shaker for the remaining 30 months of my lease.  But at 19,000 miles, the vibrations are getting more pronounced and Subaru keeps saying, &quot;Don't Worry&quot;.

On the positive side:  The car's handling is superb, ease of loading is excellent, finishing detail has been good, fuel economy has been on the mark, and the car is just plain easy &amp; fun to drive.

But the problem lies in The Boxer Engine design.  The horizontally opposed 4 cylinder engine is prone to more vibration than a vertical inline or V-shaped engine.  Some run smoother than others, and some are just plain vibrators.  Some people don't notice such things, others, like myself, find this a constant annoyance.

I have decided to return to Subaru and make my ultimatum.  Either smooth things out or let me off the ride.

Before you buy, sit in the car with the windows 3/4 of the way up, all radios off, in park, and take the engine to 1800 rpms on the tachometer.  Now slowly increase the rpms to 3000 and watch-feel the vibrations.
If smooth...you've got a good one.  If shakey.....try another before you travel in the Outback!<br><br>
