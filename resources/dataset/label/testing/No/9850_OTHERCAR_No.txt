            I was looking for a not too expensive break with some luxury in it and I prefered a car with LPG (I live in Holland). At that moment Daewoo had a big advertising campaign and I went to the nearest dealer to have a look.
The price for a 1.6 break with LPG was really attractive and so I bought the car.

The first week everything seemed ok untill I drove about 330 km with the car and it started to loose power. The reason for this was that the LPG tank was already empty! The car consumes close to 15 liters of LPG on 100 km. I went back to the dealer to have it &quot;fixed&quot;, but from his reaction I already understood that this not really fixable. The car stayed in his shop for 2 days and of course nothing was &quot;fixed&quot;. The car still uses about 15 liters in winter and about 14 in summertime. Since I drive every day 130 km for home-job-home, this means I�m standing at the LPG-pump every second day!

Now the car itself. I have it now 8 months and I have been to the carshop SIX times so far.
1. First time for the consumption &quot;fix&quot;
2. Right from the start the V-belt liked to sing his little song.
3. Taco-meter &quot;blimped&quot; around 80 km/hour.
4. One of the power-windows wouldn�t open anymore.
5. Again problems with my LPG-installation (stalled when stationary)
6. Airbag led burning + trunk-lock broken

Last time with the airbag-led was burning it took over 2 weeks before the parts arrived.

In the meantime I heard from other Daewoo drivers that they also experienced several problems especially with the electrical stuff on their cars. 

My conclusion here is that the price is low because the engine is old design and inferior parts are used throughout the car.

I think it could be a great car for the grandpa that only drives his 5 km on sunday and who is afraid to touch any of these &quot;dangerous knobs&quot;!
