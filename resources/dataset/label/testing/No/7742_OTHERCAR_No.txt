            I originally purchased this vehicle because my mom had a friend and they liked theirs.  I have been very dissatisfied with this product.  It is the first Chrysler product that I have owned and would never own another.  This car was bought brand new, with only 12 miles on it when I drove it off the car lot.  In the 2 years that I have owned this vehicle, it has been in the shop 3 times for the brakes (they say that there is nothing that they can do about the squeaking.  The first time it was in for the brakes the car had less than 1000 miles on it.  It was in the shop 3 times for the mildewy smelling air conditioning unit.  There was a clunking noise under the front end and was in the shop 3 times for this too.  I had to take the car in 2 times for pealing paint and runs in the paint, right after I brought it home.  All the weather stripping around all 4 door windows had to be replaced.  The engine mount also had to be replaced.  I know that there was more, but should anyone who purchases a brand new car be subject to any (let alone) all of this????  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone, not even my worst enemy!!!<br><br>
