            I was looking to purchase a digital camera to mess around with that was cheap and would allow me to get accustomed to using a digital camera. HP to me means quality.  I did not expect a fantastic camera for the price I was willing to pay, and I can tell you, I didn't get one.

The camera has a lot of negatives that will hopefully deter anyone who reads this from making the mistake that I made. Following is a list of the things that have irked me with this camera.

1. Battery life

This camera requires 4 AA batteries in order to operate.  I cannot explain to you how fast the batteries die when using this camera.  I have been caught several times in a bind when at an occasion the battery dies at the exact moment I want to take a picture.  The manual instructs you that should not use the display to view your pictures to conserve battery life.  What a stupid suggestion that is.  Isn't the purpose of a digital camera to view the picture you took so you can delete it and take it again until you like it?  With this suggestion you may as well use a conventional camera.  Also, the manual states that you should not use rechargeable batteries in the camera because they may cause damage.  Get your pocket books and wallets ready for some serious spending on batteries every 15 pictures!  Ridiculous. I cannot emphasize enough how quickly the battery life goes on these cameras.  There is a gauge on the display that shows you how much battery life has been used.  Once it has reached half and you attempt to take a picture, a message pops up on the screen that says "battery too low to take picture."  This is only after you take about 5-8 pictures with the display on! Absurd!  And forget about downloading your pictures to your PC using just battery power.  It will drain your batteries in 2 seconds if you are not using an AC adapter.

2. No AC adapter

The camera does not come with an AC adapter.  A typical technology ploy to make you pay, pay, and pay some more for accessories that should already be included with the camera.

3. 4 MB card

The 4 MB card allows you to save a minimal amount of pictures.  You can choose from 3 different resolutions (picture quality) with this camera.  The least quality selection allows you to take 15 pictures, medium 9, and high allows you 5.  The picture quality is not that good when you have it set on 15 pictures.  So now you are stuck with the dilemma of choosing how many pictures to choose.  God forbid if you need to take one more picture and you took 5 already.  You just don't get a good amount of pictures with this memory card.  You can always buy a bigger card of course for the camera, but it will cost you. 

4. Terrible Zoom

You have regular picture mode and 2X picture mode, that's it. It's either close or far away.  It is a fixed zoom, so you cannot zoom in and out.  Another terrible idea. You will have to walk back and forth anyway to get the picture you want.
