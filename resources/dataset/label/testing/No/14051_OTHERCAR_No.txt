            My wife and I bought our 2000 GMC in September of 99. We have always owned GMC and or Chevrolet Pickups.

We have been loyal General Motors buyers for over 30 years, all three of our sons drive G.M. trucks until now, the 2000 GMC 2500 Sierra 4x4 has spent more time in the shop in 12,000 miles than out:
   1. Front Drive unit went out, replaced by dealership, something about poor bearing alignment. Now it is making the same noise in front again. 
   2. Rear 3rd door won't align properly and lets water in, in shop twice.The door still doesn't shut correctly.
   3. Vent windows very loud don,t close properly, Dealership states GMC is working on the problem, no fix yet.
   4. Transfer case slaps when going from reverse to drive and back on auto transmission. Dealership says GMC said change the oil. Didn't fix the problem.
   5. Engine runs rough after drives over 30 miles. Dealership stated they adjusted the computer. Stills runs rough.
   6. We have documentation on all of this and are still fighting the situation. There are other problems also that we would be glad to share.
