            My mother purchased a 1999 Hyundai Elantra in July of 1999. Two weeks later, the dealership had them on sale $2,000 cheaper. That was a rather bleak beginning of this deal. The day she got the car home, she had turned off the car and when she came back, the steering wheel was locked. I received this rather distraught call from her to come find out what was wrong with her new car! I eventually got the wheel unlocked - but it happened again and again! On Thanksgiving day, her wheel locked up again and this time no one could unlock it - not me, not my husband, not my brother-in-law or my sister. The next day, mom called the shop and they sent a mechanic to look at the car - they couldn't unlock it either, so they towed it off to repair it. However, we noticed something - the car could shift into gear without the key in the ignition! Later, it was discovered that it would shift into gear - any gear - without touching the brake too. The dealership was supposed to order the part and fix it, but only did so after several calls.

Additionally, we discovered that these cars have no chime or alert mechanism installed to remind you to turn off the lights - like every other car on the market has! To make matters worse, none can be installed. We also discovered that the shocks are horrible in this car - we can feel every single bump and pothole. I have a 1998 Toyota Corolla CE and the difference between the two is like night and day. My mother constantly tells me now that she wishes she never bought the car!

This dealership shares part of the blame of the dissatisfaction we have for the vehicle.  It's very difficult to work with these people because after they sell the vehicle, they don't want to deal with you anymore - especially if you purchase an import.  Other minor problems we encountered while getting this car repaired - "Our import tech wasn't in." A dealership that SELLS this car doesn't have more than one tech?  If the Hyundai Corporation stands behind the warrantee of this vehicle as it should, they would not allow this kind of treatment of new customers.

Who should buy the car? Perhaps someone who has a background as a mechanic on imports. Who shouldn't buy the car? Anyone who wants value for their bucks.

The only car worse is my daughter's 1988 Ford Escort with 103,000 miles and a bad head. Well, maybe a Hugo.


***** UPDATE *****  

It's June 2001 and she's had the car a while. She still hates it.  We've noticed a few things now that should be a caution light.  Since she bought the car, she has had problems with the brakes.  Not just one set, but several.  They just don't last.  The tech said that brakes today don't last as long as they did when they were made of asbestos.  If that's the case, shouldn't my 98 toyota need brakes too?  She's had hers replaced 3-my 1.  The body of the car is very flimsy.  My daughter borrowed it to take something to her friend.  While inside, the neighbors got into a fight and one of them hit his head on the fender.  It caused a HUGE dent.  Estimates of the repair were $400-500 just for that dent.  Seeing that really made me afraid for her.  If a head hitting it made that kind of dent (and no, the guy wasn't knocked out), what in the world would it be like if another car hit her?  She'd have absolutely no protection.  The main other complaint is that the interior is too small.  It will seat 4 people.  Try to put a 5th one in, and you can't do it unless the 3 in the back are anorexic.  I can fit 3 in my back seat without much problem.
