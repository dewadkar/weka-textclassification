            My husband and I bought this camera at a ubid auction because it was cheap and he needed a digital camera for class. We paid 89 dollars for it.

Thus far, it's been OK.  Once we figured out the best light and distance to use it at, most of our pictures have been pretty good.  However, if it's too bright, too dark, to close or far away, or if you're holding your tongue wrong, the picture may not turn out right at all.  Once I took a picture of my Siamese cat sleeping on a green blanket, and it came out as a green Martian-cat sleeping on a green blanket!

One of the best things about it, though, is that it's remarkably easy to use.  Built and looking just like a regular film camera, it leaves little to the novice digital photographer, and thus is good for people who can be intimidated by high-tech-looking things.

I suppose the biggest gripe I have about it is that when you insert a memory stick (we have two), you never really know exactly how many pictures you're going to get.  It varies greatly depending upon where the picture is shot, etc.. . .back to the &quot;holding your tongue the right way&quot; thing.

However, for immediate or cheap acquisition (which are usually simultaneous), I would say get this camera unless you have a strong dislike for the not-quite-as-technologically-advanced.<br><br>
