            I decided to lease my Cavalier when the lease on my 1995 Geo Prizm ran out and I learned that Chevy had discontinued the Geo line and redesigned the Prizm into something I no longer liked. The Cavalier I chose was on the lot, a pretty flaming red with a sporty spoiler and lines that reminded me of a more expensive sportscar. I test-drove it and decided it was for me. Two years later, I've spent more than $2,000 in repairs and can't wait to turn it back in when the lease runs out.

This isn't a terrible car. It starts right up nearly all the time, even in the coldest weather. For a small car, it handles surprisingly well on snowy or icy roads, even plowing through some pretty deep drifts (the front-wheel drive really works), and once it gets going at highway speed, it really zips along, although not comfortably--lots of bumpiness--or quietly--the noise is very distracting.

However, this is not a car to purchase or lease if you live in an area where you'll be doing a lot of stop-and-go driving. Fourteen months after I drove the car off the lot, I had to replace my brake pads, which the dealer told me had worn through to the extent one would have expected if I'd been driving the car for three years instead of one. I'd only put 10,000 miles on the car in that year, but the nature of Long Island traffic--where it takes an average of five minutes to drive one mile if you're lucky--is that you're going to spend a lot of time with your foot on the brake pedal. Now, another thirteen months after that first replacement, I'm starting to hear the familiar squeak and feel the sponginess I felt the first time, so I'll probably have to replace them again before the winter hits.

Late last year, I had the first flat tire I'd had in 20 years of driving. The &quot;tire guy&quot; who replaced my tire said that Chevy is notorious for putting the lowest quality tires it can get away with on its new cars and that I could probably expect to replace all four tires before I turned the car back in. Sure enough, in May--at my two-year mark with the car--another tire blew out on the highway. Less than one month after that, a third tire had such worn tread that it, too, had to be replaced. That's three tires in two years, with only one of the originals left. I don't know much about tires, but it seems to me that you should be able to count on keeping the same set of them for a three-year lease.

Finally, keep an eye on the temperature gauge (incidentally, the gauge warning light on my dashboard, which tests at each start-up, reads &quot;gages&quot; rather than &quot;gauges&quot;--good for a snicker). Fifteen minutes in stop-and-go with the air conditioning on is enough to send the needle soaring toward the red zone. I've spent many a drive to or from work sweating because I've had to turn off the air conditioning and let the thing cool off. 

I'd recommend the car as a good option for a high-school or college student who needs it for basic transportation--i.e., no more than 100 miles a week of driving--in optimal driving conditions. But if you drive a lot, or will have back-seat passengers who need to be comfortable, or live in a place where traffic jams are a way of life, spend the extra money on a Honda or Volkswagen or Toyota.<br><br>
