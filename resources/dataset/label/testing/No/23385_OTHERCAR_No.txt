            I recently purchased a 2000 ML430 brand new from the local dealer.  I had a second-hand '89 260E that I wanted to trade in for a truck.  Having been around Mercedes for quite a while, I opted for the ML 430.  

I have (and still do) owned several Mercedes Benz automobiles over the past 13 years including an '87 300E, '88 560SEL, '97 SL500, '97 S500  I have owned the ML430 for about 2 weeks now and unfortunately it has spent 8 days in service. The SRS light turned and stayed on during day number 3.  I brought in the truck 1st thing Monday morning.  Later that afternoon, my serviceman called saying they would have to order a new computer module.  I didn't get the car back until Friday that week.  Later that Friday afternoon, the SRS light turned on again and wouldn't go off.  This week, I brought back the ML for repair again.  Today (Wednesday), my serviceman has replaced all the airbags thinking that was the problem, but the light is still on and they can't figure it out.  Now, my serviceman says he will be bringing in the Regional Service Manager to help out and the Shop Foreman who has been out of town.  If they can't figure it out, my serviceman says he'll probably have to replace the truck.  Again, I have owned several Mercedes Benzes that have been mostly reliable with only minor problems occurring now and then.  This is a nightmare so far.  Unfortunately, these ML's are unlike previous Benzes in one respect.  They're made in the good old U.S. of A.  I suspect that American quality control is not nearly as good as the German control.  

For example, my '87 300E has 120,000 miles on it and never has had electronic problems such as this.  Sure, the air conditioning on the 300 needed some repair and the transmission was replaced at 100,000 miles, but no other major problems that Mercedes couldn't figure out.

On the good side, this ML drives very well and has plenty of power.  It handles quite well for a truck.  Much better than any domestic truck I have driven (i.e. Suburban, Denali).  It's not too big, but big enough for daily tasks and occassional off-roading.  We drove through some gravel roads in the mountains at 60 mph and it felt solid as a rock. 

All in all, with my limited, but eye-opening experience it drives like a Mercedes, but certainly is not reliable.  If this SRS problem is indicative of what the future of this truck may be like, I might just have to apply my State's Lemon Law and ask for my money back.<br><br>
