                 First of all I want to make sure I didn't mislead you with my title.  I meant what I said in a good way!  And I DO understand why people call these cars "tanks" and "bricks" now that I own one.  People call them tanks because you feel like you're driving an army tank!  That's a good thing not a bad thing!  They are practically indestructible and you feel very safe, and that's what they are implying.  They are also called bricks because they are heavy cars and they...well, look like bricks!  And now for my review.
     I was in the market for the best used car I could find for under $3,000.  Most everything out there in this price range was high mileage, and most cars that I looked at were pretty beat up looking.  I actually wanted a Plymouth Acclaim/Dodge Spirit, but for my price, I couldn't find one with less that 100k miles on it (I would never buy an American car with over 100k miles...that's when they start to fall apart).  So, the only other cars that I heard of being really reliable and long lasting were Subarus and Volvos.  Well, I couldn't find ANY Subarus for sale within 100 miles of where I lived that were in my price range, so I was basically stuck looking for a Volvo.  I looked and looked and test drove a couple of 740's, but one was a little steep on the price and the other was very beat-up looking.  Then one day I heard from my mother that her Volvo mechanic had a Volvo that he was trying to sell.  So, I went over to look at it the next day and I completely fell in love with the car.  It was the oldest Volvo I looked at, being an '85, but surprisingly was in the best condition cosmetically AND mechanically.  I was absolutely thrilled and I hadn't even test driven it at this point!  The guy selling it wasn't there, so I had to go back again the next day to test drive it.  I inspected the car more carefully this time, analyzing the chassis, engine and the interior.  It was spotless inside and out.  I could tell that this car was definitely well cared for.  I started her up and she purred.  I tried out the few power accessories that it did have and everything worked fine.  Then I truly fell in love when I took her out on the road.  She was a bit quicker on acceleration than I expected, but still slow of course, considering that this is a Volvo and not a Mustang.  The steering was tight and had good road feel.  The suspension was typically firm, as it is on most European cars.  It actually handled very well on the highway, even though it's a tall and narrow car.  I loved how comfy the car was.  Very soft, yet supportive seats with lumbar adjustment.  The driver's seat is manually adjustable not only front to back, but also up and down...I liked that feature because I'm kind of short.  Visibility was excellent.  In fact, the best visibility I have ever experienced in a vehicle.  At that time the car had 134k miles on it and the guy was asking $2,500.  Even though the car was a mint and the price was in my budget, I was reluctant to pay that price.  I had gotten on the Kelly Blue Book website and it calculated the price as being $1,500.  But I thought to myself "Well, I DO love the car.  It IS in mint condition and needs NO repairs.  And it IS the best of the bunch that I looked at for sale", so I bought it the very next day!  And let me tell you, I'm so glad I bought it!  It still looks and runs great, and is definitely one of the best cars anyone can buy for $2,500.  My friend, being in the same financial shape that I'm in, had purchased a '93 Pontiac Grand Prix with 145k miles for a rediculously high price of $3,000 a few months before.  By the time I bought my car, she had spent $2,000 on a new transmission and she was told the engine needed to be rebuilt!  She had only put 5k miles on the car!  She got rid of the car when she was told about the engine, so she basically wasted $5,000!  That's what I mean when I say I'd never purchase an American car with over 100k miles.  I KNOW my Volvo will last another 100k miles if I continue to drive it respectably and maintain it well.  You can't beat that for $2,500!
     Now that I've rambled on and on about how much I love the car, I will tell you what I hate about it.  It has a small 4-cylinder engine with 110hp, yet I only get about 25mpg on the highway and about 15mpg in the city running on premium gas!  It's even worse with regular!  That's terrible gas mileage for a 4-cylinder like this!  I've owned other similar sized 4-cylinder powered cars that got around 35mpg on the highway.  So, needless to say, I was disapointed with this aspect of the car.  Another thing I hate about this car is the acceleration.  It feels so slow sometimes!  I hate feeling like I have to floor it to pass or to avoid being hit by someone.  I also hate the automatic transmission it has.  It shifts VERY hard!  It literally bucks into 2nd gear.  This makes city driving VERY uncomfortable!  I would expect a Volvo to be a lot more refined, especially since they've been making this basic model since 1976!  But if you have a very limited amount of cash to spend on a good car, try a Volvo!  I seriously doubt you will be disappointed!      
     

     I'm starting to have some reservations when it comes to the reliability of my Volvo.  I've realized that Volvos ARE incredibly reliable cars...that is, the main parts of the car that would typically break down with other American or Japanese cars is bulletproof on older Volvos like mine.  However, these older Volvos have lots of little annoying and expensive problems instead of the big things like engine and transmission.  I've put 12,000 miles on my car so far and it's been very good to me, considering it's age and mileage.  However, my car recieved some flood damage, which ruined the clutch on the AC compressor.  I tried to get it fixed cheaply by getting a new, smaller belt put on that would bypass the AC compressor.  This was about $85...a cheap Volvo repair.  The belt only lasted about 2 weeks before it snaped.  Because the belt that runs the AC compressor also runs the power steering pump, I've had to drive around with no power steering until I can get it fixed.  This has not been fun for me since I live in the city and have to parallel park at least 2 times a day 5 days a week.  I may have to replace the AC compressor.  It should cost about $400 for a used one I was told.  I'm not associating this annoying problem to the reliability of the car.  The problem arose to do the flood damage, not due to the the design of the car, but it still is very annoying!
     The other problem I've been having with my Volvo (probably the result of that darn flood damage) is the braking system.  I can't figure it out, but one of the calipers keeps sticking and causing un-even brake wear and very annoying pedal pulsation in the brake pedal and steering wheel.  I had this fixed a few months ago.  The first mechanic I took it to charged me $376 to replace the front brakes, rotor, and check the pulsation problem.  I got the car back in the same condition as when I left it with him!  He said he couldn't figure out what was wrong from the symptoms I described.  All the tires were balanced, he resurfaced the NEW rotors.  I took it to another mechanic, spent another $110 and the problem was solved...for a few months.  He said some hydraulic hoses needed to be replaced and one of the calipers was sticking, so he replaced it.  I got the car back and the problem was solved, but it's starting to do it again after 2 months.  ANNOYING AND COSTLY!!!  Several months later, it's smoothed out and there was no problem again.  I don't get it.  All of a sudden the brakes are pulsating again slightly, and there is a wobbly feeling in the steering wheel as I drive down the road.  I'm not at all sorry I bought the car because it runs incredibly well for a car this old and gets me where I want to go safely.  The transmission, although very harsh shifting, has no leaks and hasn't required any maintenance.  The engine still purrs and has no oil leaks or any leaks for that matter.  I just wish these darn AC and brake problems would go away!!!
     Since I paid more for the car than what it was worth and have spent several hundred dollars fixing it, I plan on keeping it for a VERY long time!  It's one of the safest and most reliable cars out there, and is not as expensive to fix as you'd think, if you have a good independent Volvo mechanic.  I recently clipped a tree branch while trying to park and shattered my front-left turn-signal cover.  I got on ebay and other internet sites to check out prices for a new, or better yet, used cover.  The cheapest I could find anywhere was about $100 for a new one or around $50 for a used one.  I thought that was absolutely absurd and refused to pay that much!  I got an idea to go take a look at the local junk yard and see if they had an old 240 sitting around that I could buy a turn-signal cover off of.  Well, they did have the turn-signal cover I needed and it only cost me $10!  Now that's more like it!  I still can't figure out why people would EVER take there car to the dealer to get repaired...unless it's under warranty of course.

This is an update on my review...I FINALLY found out what was causing all the annoying steering and brake troubles!  The inner tie rod was loose and had to be replaced.  Once my trusty Volvo mechanic fixed this (cheaply) the car runs like brand new without any steering shake or brake pulsation!  The car, affectionately named "Cocoa", is up to about 160k miles and still looks and runs fantastic for a car as old and high mileage as she is.  However, there are 3 areas on the body that are rusting really badly.  I'm positive the culprit is driving on the beach several times and not washing the car right after.  From what I've read, these areas of rust are very typical of the older 240's.  Both rear fenders, just behind the wheel wells, are rusting completely through the metal, and very quickly I might add. The 3rd area of rust-through is under the driver-side rear passenger door.  I find this terribly dissapointing because like I keep saying, the car runs very well still and the original paint is suprisingly glossy.  I'm starting to get the impression that the engine and trannny will far outlast the body.
