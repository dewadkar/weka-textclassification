            When my husband and I bought this car, it was for the looks and the value. Where else could you gets looks, comfort, features, options, ect. for the price. We were going to be able to send our middle school age daughter to college with the long warranty! Everyone asked me about my beautiful car. I thought it was the best investment we could have made, but then trouble started!!!

We had the car about 7 months when it started. It had 10,000 miles on it. We brought it into the shop and had to have things like new rotors and a NEW TRANSMISSION!! Well, that would be the first of many trips to the shop (45 miles away, I might add). After about the sixth time it was in the shop we started the Lemon Law process. Four Months Later the car is finally gone!!! We had many other problems with the car, but the transmission was the biggest. While in the shop we had it returned with things like missing bolts in the engine!! When I asked the service guy if they were going to put another transmission in it he said maybe. I express my fear that I'd have to bring it once a month forever. He said, &quot;Well, I do not know what your worried about, it has a 10 year warranty!&quot;. I replied I did NOT expect it to be in the shop once a month for 10 years!!!!

I told 3 others how much I had loved my car. My sister, a friend and her aunt. TWO OF THE THREE HAVE LEMONS!!! The other has a manual transmission and no problems YET! You do the math! 3 of 4 are Lemons,isn't that TERRIBLE!!

BUYER BEWARE!! We loved this car, but it was a piece. A real Lemon! Don't let the promise of a 10 year warranty fool you into believing it's a good car!  <br><br>
