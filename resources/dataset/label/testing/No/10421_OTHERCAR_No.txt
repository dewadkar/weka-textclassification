            If there were ever a perfect example of a Love/Hate relationship - this vehicle is it.  I've driven Grand Cherokee's for business and pleasure for over eight years now, and I'm not likely to buy or lease another one unless they make some radical changes to it.

On the plus side, the vehicle offers a lot of utility and an acceptable level of luxury.  The cabin is well appointed with lots of options, sound system is quite good, seats are acceptably comfortable, heating system works great, and there is generally excellent visibility all around.  I simply love folding down the rear seats and piling all sorts of stuff from Home Depot, Lowe's, and my local garden shop in the back.  On the downside, its not as roomy as you might expect, and at six feet, headroom has always been a problem with the optional sunroof.

Outside, the GC offers a lot of power and I've never experienced any engine or transmission problems in the three I've owned.  One of the benefits of equipping the vehicle with a tried and proven powertrain!

The 4x4 feature is the vehicle's biggest pro, and also its largest con.  I have never driven any other vehicle (car or truck or SUV) that grips the road as well the Grand Cherokee does in heavy snow or rain.  The effect is amazing.  Point it at two feet of snow, and it merrily plows right through without even the thought of slipping or sliding.  Steep driveway covered with ice?  The Jeep laughs as it drives right over it. 

Now the downside.  This same 4x4 system offers a quirky ride in normal conditions, and a questionable highway ride.  At times the vehicle feels likes it sitting on a huge balloon, take a corner too tight, and it feels like one of your tires has gone flat.  Jeep dealers will tell you this is &quot;normal effect of the advanced 4x4 system&quot; and that you'll get used to it, I never have.  It makes the vehicle feel unstable.

The powertrain can also be a tad loud, the rear end of my new latest GC had to be replaced under warranty at 10,000 miles due to excessive gear noise.  Additionally, they had to repair some wiring in the driver's door that prevented the electric windows from going down, and the rear hatch has been replaced *four* times.

Love/Hate again.  Minor bugs, all fixed at no cost and no dealer argument under warranty.

Two final comments, gas mileage stinks - I do 90% highway driving and am happy to break 15 mpg.  One the Chrysler Gold Lease was one of the easiest and most flexible I've ever signed.  Jeep also offers substantial discounts to returning Jeep customers and leasees.
