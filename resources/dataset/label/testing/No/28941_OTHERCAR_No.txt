            INTRO 

I remember passing my driving test in Brighton, England when i was just 17 years old. Being by the beach i had always dreamed of owning a convertible so i could cruise along the sea front, and this is how i came about buying the Suzuki Samurai! And what a mistake it was! 

THE CAR 

I always like the idea of being high up while driving so i could have a better view of the road in front of me, thats what drew me to mini jeeps like the Suzuki. They are cheap to buy and relatively cheap to insure. I paid 1300 pounds ($2500) for my 1987 Suzuki Samurai SJ413. It had 73,500 miles on the clock. The 1987 models had just been revamped and had new interiors. The Dashboard was square and nicely laid out, instead of having four separate round dials for the rev counter, Speedo, oil pressure and gas. There are absolutely no luxuries to talk about here, this car is about as basic as cars come. The car is quite cramped though there is ample headroom. The back seats are almost non-existent and storage space!!! What storage space!?!?!?! you have a little, little space behind the rear seats that is approximately half a foot wide and about 4 foot long!! The seats really don't offer any kind of support at all, and boy do you really need support in this car! 

I had problems with fuel economy with my Suzuki and i got told that this was a real problem with the Suzuki's. There is design fault with the carburetor and instead of Suzuki recalling the part and replacing it with fixed ones. Every time it went wrong they just told the owners to take it to the service garage and they would replace it. Sure enough looking at the cars service history, it revealed that the problem part had been replaced at least 6 times in 10 years!! Did i feel the moron for not checking into that before i bought the car (i blame it on being young and stupid and just wanting a car) but if you do buy one please look into that? So i got it fixed at my local Suzuki dealer and started to register how many MPG's i was getting. Around town it would get 17MPG and on the interstate (or motorway as we call it in England) it would get 23MPG. Put the car into four wheel drive and the car would drink gas like it was going out of fashion! So needless to say i never used 4 wheel drive! 

I bought the car really, because i could take the hood off and act real cool around town. The hood was held down by a series of poppers, straps and zippers! It comes off fairly easily and is probably one of the only things that can be stored behind the back seats! Yeah Baby! This is more like it, hood down, wind in your hair, and then comes the rain! Oh boy do you have problems when that happens! Trying to get the hood back on at the best of times takes at least 5 minutes, so you can imagine what it is like when it is pouring hard! Trying to get the hood down in the runners, popping the poppers and doing up the zips! Once you have the hood on and you get back into the car, it is like driving around in an aquarium! What a joke! 

THE RIDE 

ROUGH! This has got to be the most uncomfortable cars i have ever driven in my life. If you have had fillings done before and you get in this car and drive around, you will need them done again because they will be shaken out! Every little bump or every little stone you hit sends tremors through the car! It's like being in an earthquake! 

On a very serious note though. The reason why i sold this car is because i think it is very dangerous to drive! I was driving along Brighton seafront and the weather was just terrible, raining, strong winds etc. I was driving along the road and all of a sudden this huge gust of wind blew me straight into the oncoming traffic and there was not a thing i could do about it! Luckily i managed to regain control of the car and bring it to a stop so i could have a heart attack! The car is very light and has a very high center of gravity and this causes problems when cornering. If you take a corner to tight, it would be very easy to tip this thing over. I Almost did a couple of time while going at slow speeds. i think this is a problem in many SUV's and other like cars but it is really terrifying. 

THE ENGINE 

There are 2 engine options available. a 1 liter and a 1.3. Do not get the 1-liter! I took one for a test drive and it felt like i was going backwards, even the old people on their little electric scooters were over taking me! The 1.3 is slightly better but not by much! There is a bunch of power in first and second, but then i expect that because the car is designed for off road use and those 2 gears are where you need power. On the Motorways the car would struggle to reach 70 mph, and when it did the engine was screaming so loud it sounded like it was going to explode! This makes over taking a real problem and once again can be dangerous. 

I was Young, i wanted a cool car i could pose in, but it was probably the biggest mistake of my life that could have quite easily cost me my life! Do not buy this car
