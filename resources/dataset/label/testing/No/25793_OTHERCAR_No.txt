            I purchased the 1997 Mazda 626 LX  4-cylinder used earlier this year (Jan 2001) and would have to say I'm quite pleased with the product.  It has decent space, reasonably comfortable seats (though my back could use a little more support on long drives), pretty good performance, and solid gas consumption.  The only real flaws (and I may be nitpicking) are the paint job and fit and finish of the interior.

Space-wise, this sedan can handle two good-sized adults up front, but the back might be cramped for anyone over six feet tall.  The front seats are quite comfortable for short to medium length drives, but any drive over four hours or so will require a rest stop here and there to loosen up your back.  The steering wheel tilts, so it's pretty easy to find a comfortable driving position, as the other controls are all within reach and pretty well laid out.  The cruise control button on the dash hides a little bit behind the steering wheel and wiper controls, but it's not too bad.

Oh, one annoying thing.  The cup holders are molded into the center console between the auto transmission and the ashtray/lighter on the dash.  Fine, but in order to reach the lighter, you need to open a door that comes down right where your drinks would be.  I like to charge my cell phone as I drive, but can't do it if I have a drink in the holder.  Not sure if this was fixed in later models, but Mazda might want to look into that.

There are also a couple of annoying rattles in the car that I can't seem to isolate.  There's one in the pillar on the passenger side, in the area where the seat belt is stowed.  And another comes right from the lower part of the dash.  I usually ignore them, but they can get tedious if I'm stuck in traffic.  Kinda like a pen that clicks, and clicks, and clicks, and clicks...

The paint job seems a little flimsy.  It doesn't take much to nick, scratch, and ding this car.  Just think about that if you have tight parking spaces where you live.

I get good mileage, even with the auto transmission.  I figure it to be about 30 mpg on the highway, about 24 mpg in the city.  Considerably less with the A/C on, but I guess that's pretty much universal.

Speaking of the transmission, let's just say it isn't exactly Benz-quality.  It does a lot of "hunting" at low speeds and up inclines.  The shifts can be a bit jarring when you're circling around a mall parking lot.  But once on the open road, it shifts smoothly and at the correct RPMs for most driving styles.

So, overall, I'd say this was a good value for the money (it had 37K miles on it, and I paid about $10,000).  I'd recommend it as an alternative to the lower-end Accords and Camrys (with 4 cylinders).  I chose the 4 cylinder for economy over performance, and found that I've got a nice blend of both.

NOTE:  Last week, my "Check Engine" light came on, so I brought it immediately to the dealer.  Turns out they had to replace the precat (pre-catalytic converter), which was about a $700 job, at least.  However, it fell under Mazda's 50,000 mile warranty (I was at 46K).  So it didn't cost me a dime.  I was in and out of there in two hours.  Nice....

NEW NOTE (12/28/01):  Ah, I was so naive when I wrote this.

Here's an update:  
About three months ago, the factory alarm went schizo on me and drained my battery.  No problem, got a new battery.  Then I noticed that the car was idling really low, to the point of cutting off unless I kept a little pressure on the gas pedal.  Took it into the shop thinking it was just a simple adjustment.  Well, $550 later I left with new oxygen sensors.

I've been reading about people complaining that their automatic transmissions are garbage in the 626 4-cylinder.  I figured I was one of the lucky ones -- as I said earlier, not a great tranny, but it works.  Well, now it's slipping constantly, and the "O/D" light is blinking on the dash.  From standstills (lights, stopsigns, etc), the car tries to accelerate from second gear, then hunts for first, with a really sharp kick when it finds it.  

I performed all the required maintenance on the transmission -- checking the fluid levels, etc.  I even had the system flushed out and filled about a month ago.

Needless to say, I dread going into the shop with this one.  My Mazda warranty was up about 9K miles ago, so I'd be on my own.  I'm getting ready to buy a new home in about a month, and did not need the added stress and expense of getting a new transmission for the car (which I have a feeling is going to be what needs to be done).

Amazing how quickly my tune about this car changed, huh?  That's what happens when you're in the shop three times in one year for MAJOR repair work.

UPDATED:  1/10/02
The tranny needed to be replaced, a $2300 repair.  All this at 59K miles.  I've researched the net and found I'm not alone on this either.  What a shame.
