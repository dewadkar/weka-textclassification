            As a website designer, I needed a good quality digital camera that I could rely on to take nice looking pictures.  I went out to Sears and purchased a Sanyo VPC-X350 digital camera.  The camera is good for the price, but the pictures it takes aren't as clear as I would have liked them to be.  The resolution is not quite megapixel and you can tell by the bit of graininess in pictures that you take with it.  You are able to save in a variety of resolution and compression modes, and even at the highest setting you can still tell that the pictures were taken with a digital camera.  I would recommend this camera for a person that's higher than entry level in digital photography, but not quite professional.  The price is right, and the resolution is good for most jobs.  It also has the ability to capture short video footage so that's also another plus!<br><br>
