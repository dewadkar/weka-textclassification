            I was nineteen when I decided to buy my first brand new vehicle.  I woke up one morning and said I will come home with a new car today.

I drove two hours from my home to a dealership,just because the radio said that they were having a great deal that day.  When I got to the dealership I was greeted by a nice man,(of course he was nice he was trying to sell me a car and go to Disney for selling the most cars.).  We started looking around at the different vehicles on the lot.  The guy told me that no one would give me financing on a car unless it was brand new.(Of course at my age I figured that he knew what he was talking about.).  He told me that I could get a neon because it had a fifteen hundred dollar rebate at the time,so I said ok we will try it.

I was only told the base price of the vehicle,which was eleven thousand dollars.  I figured that it was a fair price to pay for a 1999 vehicle.  I was approved for the loan and when we were done signing the papers on the car I realized that the final price on my car was eighteen thousand dollars just for a four door 1999 dodge neon.

I shortly found out that the neon is not a great winter car.  In the first two weeks that I owned the car I went off the road twice and got stuck a few times.  I know for a fact that the tires were good in the snow because they are the same tires that I had on my other vehicles through out the winter.

During the summer this vehicle isn't that bad.  The neon is roomy,rides good,and gets good mileage.  The neon is known for major costly repairs nothing has happened to me yet but my car is slowly going down hill,I have only had my car for a year and I know that it will not last me my next four years that I have to pay for it.<br><br>
