            Well, I just got back from the store after returning
the Sony Mavica CD250.  I guess that revelation takes
the suspense out of the review.  

I really had high hopes for this camera and badly
wanted the "convenience" of CD storage and upload.
If the technology was sound it would be great--
aside from the clumsy shaped camera.
But IMO this product shouldn't be on the market.
Here's why:

The dreaded disc error. Right from the beginning, right out
of the box, with brand new shiny discs, I kept getting disc 
errors on the camera display.  When that happens, the user is stuck: can't photograph, retrieve photographs, etc.
Sometimes it'd clear up after power cycling the camera
and/or cleaning the disc.  Other times I'd be forced to
conclude the disc is toast.  (Oh, and BTW these are
Sony discs that came with the camera, so compatibility
shouldn't be an issue.)  It's pretty annoying to take a lot
of photos and be unable to retrieve them.

And I know the problem is widespread because I looked at 
camera/Mavica discussion groups, one Mavica group on yahoo for example.  A hot ongoing topic is what to do when the
dreaded disc error occurs.  Mavica owners live in terror of that.  They call Sony asking for help; they exchange advice,
and give moral support.  It's ridiculous.  Any convenience gained from the CD medium is lost to the hassle of the 
chronic disc errors.  Not to mention the expense of having
to replace a fairly new disc the camera decided it didn't like.  

Possible reasons for the (Sony brand) disc errors are
fingerprints on the disc and jiggling of the camera.
Hard to get around those.  It's a small CD, not standard 
size.  So if your PC's disc drive can't accommodate it,
it must be inserted into a plastic donut-type sizer 
to adapt it to the PC drive.  Try doing that without 
getting fingerprints on it.  Pert near impossible.  
And this camera is psycho about fingerprints; if it
detects one it swoons and spews disc errors.  If your PC
can accommodate the small CDs it's not as much of a problem
avoiding fingerprints.  Still, the camera is too sensitive 
to them.  My CD player doesn't barf every time I touch 
a CD.  Heck, I could play Frisbee with my CDs and my 
player, and many portable players, wouldn't blink.

Most portable CD players also don't have problems with
reasonably gentle movement.  Just try moving around
while using the CD Mavica.  The disc drive goes into a 
tailspin and make weird noises and, what else, displays 
disc errors.  Therefore this is a camera for static photography, ideally in house, not running around 
outside shooting pics.  It's very limiting.  Even so, I *was* just using my camera indoors, and it still swooned.

It's too bad, it's a good concept, and the CD holds a ton
of pics, but Sony just didn't iron out the bugs before
they started peddling it.  Really makes me think less of
them as a company.

Other more minor complaints:

Big, clunky, ugly design due to need to house disc drive.
Therefore very hard to hold and reach/press buttons at
the same time.  The button to switch macro mode on/off
is very poorly positioned so that it's way too easy to
accidentally hit it and not realize it until lots of out of
focus shots have been taken.  Very bad ergonomics.

There are things I liked about it, as listed in the Pros.
But the bottom line is that the technology is just too imperfect to be in the marketplace.
