            I must admit, I was sold by this camera's smart looks, compact size, easy-to-use features, durable metal body and Nikon name brand quality. I was looking for a camera that would easily fit into a pocket or pack to document my life in my wandering years. I was willing to pay that hefty price tag to get it. 

These strong points mean little at this point, since I've rejected the $180+ repair for a broken camera suffering "impact damage" for which Nikon has voided its warranty. Lifetime of my Coolpix SQ: less than 4 weeks... about one 256mb Compact Flash card's worth.

Let me praise the camera that I almost came to know...

I may be the odd man out here, but I particularly like the missing view finder. One is forced to use the LCD view-screen to frame the shot. This combined with the Cool-pix swivel adds an entertaining edge to taking photographs. It's easy to catch the unexpected candid shot from the waist or to frame that high reach shot with arms extended above your head. I found myself always rethinking the frame as it moved easily toward the art shot. 

The result... some pretty bad photography, but some real gems. I'm confident the overall quality would have improved in time. That's the beauty of digital right, an endless number of chances to get things just so. Some of my best shots were the macros. It's just so easy to choose your line of sight with this camera, but I found it  hard to judge focus from that small LCD and some of the macros failed me there. 

There's been some reviews claiming grainy photographs. I had my share of those, but I'll chalk some of that up to inexperience with the camera. I found some of the presets to be less than optimal for certain conditions, but was impressed with the settings more often than not. I leave it at this... I wasn't surprised at the clarity or balance of my photographs, the camera presented the same set of challenges I've always had as a dabbling novice photographer.

My big gripe!

In a very short time the camera became a big waste of money. It did not hold up to what I would claim as the standard wear and tear expected in a consumer grade model. I have now spent nearly $400 for the experience of trying out a digital camera and will have to resort to disposables to record my holiday adventures.

What were my expectations of this camera? 

I expected that it would fit neatly into the pocket of my shirt or my jeans and come out firing. I expected that in it's long life it would take a tumble to the car floor when I slammed on the brakes, it might get pushed off the coffee table or slip from my hands on a cold pre-caffeinated morning. I expected at least 4 years of companionship. To me, $100 a year dues, is plenty for the fun of snapping pictures.

What I got.

I got a camera that showed external signs of wear within days of putting it in my pocket, a LCD that carried a permanent smudge, and a camera dead in the water when the pack it shared with my portable CD player dropped a full 12" to the floor. Don't worry, the player is fine.

Some might claim I have no claim. But I bought a product advertised as being of sturdy metal construction and designed to slip into a pocket. It's advertised as a camera for the photographic novice to amateur, not for the semi to legitimate pro with specialized equipment and all attention on his craft. I was sold on a camera that would come with me where I wanted to go and would frame me a picture when the thought happened to cross through my mind and into my fumbling fingers. What I was sold was a camera that I would now be afraid to carry out of the house... that is, if I finally decide to fork over another $180. 

One last word.

I'm surprised Nikon doesn't protect its name by giving better support to this line of cameras that just hasn't been or perhaps can't be, brought up to a general consumer standard.
