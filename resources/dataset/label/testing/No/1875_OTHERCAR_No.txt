            My fiance owns a 92 Grand Am and has nothing but rouble out of it since we have been together.  Perhaps I am just bad luck, but I think the car is a wreck.

Everything rattles, the air conditioner and heater works only when it feels like it, and the light on the dash board won't stay on.  After numerous service checks no one has been able to find anything wrong with the car.

Also, I have never seen a car that just quits running with a quarter of a tank of gas.  If the car gets to a quarter of a tank you better head to the gas station because if you are not careful you will find yourself walking!

I suppose it was a reliable car at some point, I just think its days are numbered.<br><br>
