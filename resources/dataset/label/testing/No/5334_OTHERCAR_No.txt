            In 1996 I purchased a Plymouth Grand Voyager.  Boy, what a stylish, van I thought.  This was the first van and the  first year that the second sliding door on vans came out. This van really looked nice and drove smooth.  What more could you ask for?  The kids had plenty of room.  It was great until the problems started.  I can name about every part on the van because we had problems with everyone of them.  From a hole in the gas tank ( I kept smelling gas right after we got the van) to that second sliding door that constantly rattled.  I made 15 trips, yes 15 in 2 years to the service department.  Many of the trips were because the service wasn't performed right the first time.  That tells a lot about the service department.  I visited them so much they knew when I had to be at work and where I worked.  Just a little ridiculous.  Don't buy your Plymouth from another state, you will be at the bottom of the list to be looked at.  They gave me every rental car in town to try.  I don't think I ever got my vehicle back the day I brought it in.  The incident that broke the camels back was when I took a trip out of town with a girlfriend.  On our last day of vacation we were headed back to our state, the van would not shift gears.  We couldn't go faster than 40MPH.  It was then 4pm.  We found a phone book and headed for the closest Plymouth dealer.  Needless to say we could not be seen that day.  The next day (at the end of the day) we were told we needed a new transmission. I about died, what would it cost? Well, the cost was just my deductible and....3 more days of hotel, clothes (we only had 2 days worth), food, entertainment, and transportation.  I was beside myself.  Not to mention my girlfriend was due back at work the day after we were headed back.  She had to call in for three more days.  They replaced the transmission and we got back home.  Two weeks later I had the same problem.  I brought it to the dealer, this time they said it wasn't the transmission that needed to be replaced but it was an electrical problem.  They kept my vehicle for 3 days.  I was also charged $250.00 because between the 2 weeks my warranty expired and I was into my extended warranty which didn't cover this part.  After that was fixed I waited 2 weeks and bought a NISSAN QUEST.  I will never buy an American made car again.  Some thought I just had a lemon, whatever the reason it left a very SOUR taste in my mouth.  The Nissan has been the best van ever I love it.  If you want to know more about it read my review on that vehicle.<br><br>
