            After seeing the rave reviews for this car i had to throw in my 2 cents.  I bought mine slightly used at the end of 2001.  I loved it.  I have the 1.8 turbo and it's REALLY fast.  I think the seats are very comfortable which some have complained about.  Lots of trunk space, reasonable amount of space in the back- enough for my 8 year old anyway.  And it's one of the best looking cars on the road (get silver if you get a Jetta- it goes with the wheels and never looks dirty).  
The problem?  
Minor problems: 1)the doors tend to rattle non-stop.  I don't care but this drives some people nuts.  2) It takes a really long time switch from drive to reverse and vice versa.  This is annoying and potentially dangerous if you needed to move quickly to avoid something.  3)Neolithic seat adjustment that only Houdini himself could operate.  
Big Problems: 1)  A few times the car has refused to shift out of park- leaving me going crazy from 5 to 10 minutes when it will mysteriously shift into drive.  I have to wonder if it could get completely stuck. Ive heard other have had this problem to the point where they returned the car to the dealer. 2)From the outset it would sputter slightly when i started it in the winter.  By the second winter it started stalling the first 1-3 times I would start it  (I live in NC so it doesnt get all that cold).  This has gotten worse and worse so that now it will stall out even when its not cold outside, and the worst is sometimes if the engine isnt fully warm the car wont go when you press the accelerator.  This is sporadic so ill be driving along with no problems, stop at a light and then the car wont go.  I press the accelerator and nothing happens.  After a minute of press/depress the car will suddenly go like there was no problem.  Again this could be dangerous.  Ive taken to the shop repeatedly and get the same "Uhhhhh.....we dont know.  We'll replace the computer" every time.  And every time there's no improvement.  Thank god they list this as emissions for the warranty so i havent had to pay for the $2500 theyve spent so far.
For what its worth i worked as an assistance at a garage for a while and know a little about how these things work, and my mechanic friends have all looked at it.  We're baffled.  No one can find the problem.
In conclusion im aware most people havent had this problem, but i worry that my car might be indicative of whats going to happen to the other  '01 Jettas.  Mine will be sold to a dealer soon, so if you live in greensboro don't buy a silver '01 Jetta turbo.
