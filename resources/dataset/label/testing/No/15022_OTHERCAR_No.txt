             At the price, this camera isn't worth it.  I've used many digital cameras through my child identification card organization, and I can tell you that if you are looking for picture quality, don't get this camera.  The resolution is simply not good enough.  In perfect lighting conditions, when the planets are aligned just right, you might get a picture on this camera that can be of acceptable quality after printing.  I certainly would not recommend using this as a family camera that will take valued photos--stick with your 35 mil.  Don't bet on great picture editing software to take the graininess out of any given picture taken by the FD-73. If for some reason you want to shrink pictures down to thumbnail size, this camera is acceptable (at that size, it is difficult to tell the difference between a .3 megapixel and a 1.3 megapixel picture).  But otherwise, if you want to go digital, shell out the extra couple of hundred for the Sony Mavica FD-90 or the new CD-1000.  
 The good news here is that around 16 pictures can fit onto one floppy disk.  In Black and White mode, well over 20 can fit.  Recharging a depleted battery takes about and hour and a half.  The 10X zoom is handy in most situations, but again, if the picture is grainy, it doesn't matter how close it is to your target--its still grainy.
  One good thing I can say about this camera is that it can withstand a beating.  I took literally thousands of pictures and it didn't even look worn--which makes its resale value higher.<br><br>
