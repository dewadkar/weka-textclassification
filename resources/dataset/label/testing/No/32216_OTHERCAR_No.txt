            I originally posted a glowing review of the 911, having been suckered by the badge on the front. Having owned the car for four months and wised up, I outed it in favour of an E55 AMG Benz. Here goes the updated opinion...

The Porsche's interior materials and switchgear are nothing short of insulting on a $88K car, and laughable next to a BMW 7 or Mercedes-Benz S. My old Nissan Skyline GT-R V-Spec was more rewarding to drive, providing an explosive punch that the Carrera lacked.

Never take advice from anyone who says a Porsche is their "dream car": it simply means that they're blind to its faults. For example, the way both front headlamps mist up like cheap watches on damp days. The windows won't close above 80mph, the wipers are inefficient above 90mph, and leave the glass above 110mph. No, really. There's also alarming understeer when going uphill in the wet - and you don't need to be Sir Isaac Newton to figure out why. Plus the steering gets light above 100mph, again thanks to 60% of the car's entire weight hanging out the back.

Inside, the standard stereo is truly awful; the ï¿½1,000 10-speaker upgrade in mine was no obvious improvement. There's no lumbar adjust, with the seat bottoms flat and having zero lateral support. Bizarre. The switchgear was shiny and of immeasurably low quality, and would look cheap in a Chrysler Neon. The centre console compartment emitted a plasticky creak when you opened it, was too short to hold a pen and too shallow to hold a CD.

Performance wise, the car was fast, certainly, but a long way from breathtaking. I expected much, much more. Recent ubersaloons such as the M3, M5 and E55 are more accessible, better made, less expensive, and real-world faster. And you get let out of busy junctions.

So in short: AVOID, unless you feel you have to have that badge, in which case genuine opinions such as this one won't mean a thing to you. Go buy one!
