            I purchased my 4 door red Geo in late November.  In fact, the dealer had to travel 100 miles within the state to get the exact one that I specified.  It was my first car purchase ever.  I was SO excited!

Well, in less than 6 months, the car had a MAJOR problem.  I was traveling 35 minutes one way to work, when the car would unexpectedly &quot;lock&quot; and the wheel would only want to steer the car to the right.  VERY scary!  Since the car was still under warranty, the dealership towed the car and fixed it.  Well, it took 2 repairs before it was fixed correctly.  The problem ended up being the rack and pinion.  I'm not a technical person, so I really can't describe it, except that when your car has this problem, you're immediately in bad shape to yourself and others on the road.

Less than a year later, I was driving at dusk on an open country road.  Suddenly, I see a big black dog step off of the side of the road right in front of my car.  I slammed on brakes.  The dog's head went through the front plastic bumper, but I didn't know this at the time.  All I knew was that the dog yelped, and ran off.

On arrival back home, I noticed the &quot;hole&quot; the dog's head left.  When I braked, I was going approximately 35 miles per hour.  That's not very fast to be going in an accident.  What if I had hit something bigger and was going faster?

Then, about 7 years later, I was driving along another country road (adjacent to the above-mentioned road).  It was very early in the morning.  I was about to cross a bridge.  I saw a mother deer leap across the road; and I thought I had braked in time.  Well, I did for MOMMY, but as I have learned since then, if you see one, you've seen a herd.  A baby had crossed right behind the mother, colliding with my front end, damaging the bumper again.

A 3 cylinder car like the Metro seems to require a lot of maintenance and repair.  I know when my car is &quot;messing up&quot; again, because it acts balky and whiny and refuses to accelerate decently.  The cylinders have always been the first thing to go on my car.  It also seems like that the tires also go bad quicker on this car than my Saturn.  I don't have a theory for this, but would like to warn the reader that it is getting harder and harder to find the specific size needed for this small car.  Often, our kind car mechanic goes to the car junkyard to get us a decent deal.  Hey, why pay full price on something that doesn't last, anyway?

I really don't want to be cynical about this car.  I dubbed it my little Red Ladybug, due to color and size.  It does get me places speedily.  But, I know that every time I hit the freeway, I'm REALLY putting my life in God's hands.  The safety issues are there.  Besides the poorly built plastic bumper, the car dings easily, sways with any slight breeze, and the repairs are expensive when specialized parts have to be ordered.  But, it you like to gamble with your life, then take the Geo for a spin.  You might like it better than a rollercoaster ride.<br><br>
