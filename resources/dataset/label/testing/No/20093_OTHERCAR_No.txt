            I bought my 1995 Mazda Protege new, about 6 years ago.  Since then we have put about 55,000 miles on it, about half in Michigan, and half here in California.  In addition to regular city driving, we have used it for weekend trips and some long distance, cross-country trips.

I have the most basic trim line, I think the DX.  It is manual transmission, nice factory stereo, a/c.  In the 1995 model year, this trim line didn't include fold-down rear seats.  For this reason, I now regret not stepping up to the next line, I think the LX.  Not having fold-down rear seats is annoying.

Overall we like this car.  It is agile.  With the manual transmission, it is peppy and fun to drive.  Mileage is absolutely fabulous.  On the highway it is STILL averaging about 39 mpg, in city traffic it is maybe around 30.  Every two years it passes the smog checks here in California with flying colors - if you look at the printout you will see that most of the measured amounts are close to 0.  

For a compact, it is relatively roomy.  In a pinch, we have been able to fit five adults without any serious problem.  The trunk capacity is OK.

The one thing that has been bothering us about this car is that we have had several parts fail that turned out to be extremely expensive to replace.  I'm not talking about parts that you expect to replace because of wear and tear, for example the muffler or the brakes, I'm talking about electrical and other parts that you almost never hear about because they normally fail so rarely.  I just spent more than $1000 replacing the throttle body.  A year or two ago I had to replace a switch that controlled the turn signal for about 500 dollars.  One or two other things failed while it was still under warranty, had we paid for these ourselves they would have been expensive.  In general, the parts that failed are ones that really should have lasted for the life of the car, not 50,000 miles.  It has reached the point where I have begun to wonder when the next failure will occur and I will have to shell out $$$...

Perhaps this string of odd failures is just our bad luck, since the Protege normally does get good reviews, and we owned a 1993 Protege that we put more than 80,000 miles on with no problems at all, but nevertheless, this is very odd. 

If you buy one of these used, I would encourage you to go over it very carefully, test drive it, and perhaps have it inspected by a mechanic, before making a decision.  You might want to see if you can inspect the repair history.
