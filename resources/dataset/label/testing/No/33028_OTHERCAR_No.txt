            I purchased this vehicle as a graduation gift to myself.  It has a great sporty look without a sports car insurance rate.  It is a beautiful car loaded with many options.  The only thing I learned to love is its looks. I purchased this car as a returned lease with 36,000 miles on it.  It is a 1995 Dodge Avenger and I purchased it in 1998.  Since April of 1998 I have had 4 transmissions in the car.  I have had very little cooperation from the dealer, a &quot;five star&quot; dealership (whatever that means!).  Daimler-Chrysler has been very unhelpful, also.  I just wanted answers as to why the transmission keeps &quot;failing&quot;.  The only answer that I have received is that I could sell the car.  So, they basically have told me to pass my headache onto somebody else.  Thankfully I purchased an extended warranty....it paid for itself with the first transmission.  And trust me...I have had other problems...distributor, ball joints, steering..
Please...BEWARE!!!!  Do not let its great looks hook you in!<br><br>
