            I have a '96 XJR with 24K miles.  This may not last, but at least right now, this is an amazing deal.  The car is under warranty for *four* years.  My experience of BMW and Mercedes service departments has me believe that they could take many lessons from Jaguar on how to do it right.  Jaguar has been extremely generous in keeping this car practically new, even after four years.

I looks terrific to me, but handles even better.  In terms of enjoyment, I can hardly tell the difference between this XJR and a M3 or ML55.  It feels fast and it fast.  The '96 has a supercharged V6 with 322hp and some 350+ft.lbs. of torque.  The '98 are supposed to be better.  They also have a much more attractive dash board and a slightly more functional and attractive interior.

The XJRs have very little chrome compared to the XJ6, XJ8, or VDP.  This can be a plus or a minus.  The stereo is terrific.  The headroom is less than I would like at 6'1&quot;.  Both me and my 5'8&quot; wife find the car to be long.  It is a little too long to park comfortably sometimes.  Certainly much more difficult than comparable super-sedans.

The 'J' shift gate does not bother me.  I actually like it better than MB's solution.  (I prefer the automatic over the manual of a BMW for my daily terrain).  It is very fast.  I don't know the 0-60 time, but better than that, there is significant power left at freeway speeds. It is quiet below 95, then there is wind noise from the drivers side window.  It effortlessly cruises at any speed you would feel comfortable driving at in the U.S.

It may tend to understeer on corners, if anything, but that is with traction control engaged.  The 17&quot; P-zeros feel great, if short-lived (10K mi.)

The rear seat is very comfortable, and feels great, but it is *only* for two people.  Do not try to put three people in the back.  The middle person will have their chin in their knees because of the higher middle bolster.  The interior and the trunk are surprisingly small for a car this large, but Jaguar delivers performance and grand design.  

It appears to me to be a stately automobile.  I occurs as art to me; I enjoy looking at it.  I have found the Lexus', BMW 5-series' (but not the M-5) and the E-class designs to be drearily common.  Not so, the Jaguar.  It is more rare and perhaps more fun because of it.

Most importantly, it remains an absolute joy to drive.<br><br>
