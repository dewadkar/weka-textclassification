            I'm an 18 year old male who had a sports car before getting this TL. Now, it seems fairly odd for a teenage male to be interested in such an "old person" car, but the TL is one beautifully styled car with great value and a lot of sex appeal.

The TL is a very sexy car and even though it is geared toward an older market, it has a faithful young group of supporters. The powerful 3.2 liter engine with 225hp speaks for itself. You get all this and more for a very fair price (I paid 27500 after tax tags and fees - I think it was 26461 before all the other fees).

The heated seats are a blessing in the winter. Other goodies such as outside mirror heating and auto dim rearview mirror add to the overall value of the car and very are nifty features I might add. The only things I believe the TL is lacking are memory seats, a six disc in dash changer, and right side tilting mirror when in reverse.

The ride in the TL is incredibly smooth and quiet, although at high speeds there is a lot of wind noise. A little bit more than you would expect from a mid-luxury car. 

One thing that I don't like is that Acura kind of neglected the 2001 model year, offering no changes from the 2000 model year and then coming out with a 2002 model with more than 500 improvements only a few months after the 2001 came out. The 2002 model incorporated the memory seats, rear tilt mirror, and 6 disc in dash player.

Overall the TL is a great car with a great price, but I would much more recommend getting the 2002 model if you can afford to pay a little bit more.
