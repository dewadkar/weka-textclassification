            The reason I purchased this camera was because of the price $350, which was a good price when I bought it. Well, I wish I would have known something about digital cameras before purchasing this one. There is no auto-focus, instead you only have 3 focus settings so if you get a good clear picture you were lucky. In low lit areas the pictures are horrible! It takes only 12 high resolution pictures on a 2 MB memory card and sucks up 4 batteries in a few hours. The PC serial connection used to upload your photos is out of date and slow. Sometimes I can't even get my software to recognize when it is connected. The only thing good that I have found about this camera is that it is cheap, the pictures are good enough to put on the web and e-mail and the photo-editing software is alright. I would only recommend this camera to someone looking for a very cheap camera to mess around with on the computer. If you are looking for a good camera that takes good resolution pictures, then this is not what you are looking for. This camera will not replace your everyday 35mm camera.
