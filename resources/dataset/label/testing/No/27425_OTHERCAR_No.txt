            In 1995 my wife convinced me to buy her a Dodge Neon because it was cute.  I agree, it is a great looking car and it has a lot of good points.  The power is great, it is easy to drive, and the interior is very comfortable.  It has more room than I expected and better than average visibility for a tall person like me.  

However, overall I have been extremely disappointed in this car.  The maintenance costs have been much higher than expected, and it has spent more time in the shop than any other car I have owned.  The electrical system is constantly causing me problems such as bad battery cables (replaced 3 times already), the turn signal switch went bad, the starter went bad, and the emergency flashers stopped working.  Also, the car has been into the shop twice for repairs due to recalls, which although are performed at no cost to me, still cost me in renting a replacement while the the repairs are being performed.  

I have found two other disappointing features about this car.  The first is the noise of the wind around the closed windows when there is a crosswind.  Occasionally the noise is so loud I can't even listen to the radio while driving.  The second is the small space for the spare tire.  The spare is located in the bottom of the trunk.  The car came with a small donut spare, which was not sufficient if I had tire problems while on a long trip, which I frequently take.  I bought a full size spare tire, and found it does not fit in the space provided in the trunk.

Overall, the car is not extremely reliable and is noisy in high winds.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone who lives in a windy area or takes long trips.  <br><br>
