            Do you even know what you're in for with this car? Maybe this isn't for you. If you don't you've clicked on the right opinion.  I'll tell you exactly what you need to know.  Now obviously this is a sports car, so if you are a family man (or woman) than this car isn;r your best choice unless its a 2nd car on the side.  For a primary car try the Dodge Intrepid or Jeep, which i have already written opinions on, go read them!

This car is very nice and showy if you are trying to impress someone, or if you are a semi-speed daemon.  Otherwise you don't really need to bother with this car. 

However if you are the speedy type a Ferrari is perfect choice along with a Viper which i have wirrten an opinion on as well.  I personally like the Viper cause its the fastest american made car, but a Ferrari i definetly would not complain about owning thats for sure.<br><br>
