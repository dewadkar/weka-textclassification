            The 1999 Mazda 626 was my first car that was not a Nissan.  I was attracted by the price and look of the car.  This car was also my first automatic, which could explain why certain maintenance problems have come as a surprise to me.

For the most part, I have liked this car.  I got a great deal and it has all the options I wanted.  I loved several of the colors and was very happy to have so many color choices.  The gas mileage is a bit lower than I had in my 3 Nissans, but still isn't bad, and the car handles well.  There is plenty of passenger room (but, I discovered that 7 people is the limit).

The biggest problems I have had with this car have been minor, but annoying nonetheless.  A few weeks after I bought the car, a belt started squealing.  At first it was only when I started the car, but then it started occurring during turns too.  Finally I took the car in and got the belt adjusted, a trip to the dealership that I would have preferred to avoid.  Several weeks after this incident, the belt broke and caused all kinds of lights to go off on my dashboard.  The car got towed and the belt replaced, another major inconvenience that left me begging for rides.  After that, there was one more problem with a squealing belt that required yet another trip to the dealership for an adjustment.  All of these problems occurred during the first year I had the car (which just ended, since I bought it as a leftover in January of 2000).

While I like most things about the car, and the people doing the repair work have been great to deal with, I fear I will come to regret my decision to buy this car when the warranty expires.  If there were so many problems in the first year, I'm worried about what will happen later.
