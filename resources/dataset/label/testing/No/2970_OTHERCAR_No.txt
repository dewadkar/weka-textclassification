            Been there done that is best way to describe
Navigator.  Would have been better off with
an Eddie Bauer Expedition wouldn't have taken
as large of loss to get rid of. 

Had a Jeep Cherokee, even the large GMC
suburban, recommend both over the Navigator. Jeep
easier to maneuver and seats more comfortable. GMC
harder to park than Jeep but was still preferred
over the Lincoln. I don't have good luck with
Lincoln's -- a Mark Series lived at the dealer
for repairs.

Main dislikes of Navigator, Seats not comfortable
especially on long trips, even with various settings
could never find a comfortable area in relation to 
seeing the dash controls.  Steering to me always felt
vague had dealer say it was tires, or use different
tire pressure too change shocks, but have read reviews
mentioning same feeling. Gas mileage was not expected
to be great but 14 on highway, Suburban got 20. Another
problem that could not solve was a smell coming from the
A/C (musty or mildew odor) again all got from dealer 
was to put a disinfectant which was good for a couple
of days. A safety issue was the narrow running boards
was hard to step on when exiting had to turn foot side
ways. If was wet guarantee slip, got so just slide out.
These have been replaced on newer models along with 
better leather so seats might be more comfortable.
This vehicle has blind spots especially to small cars
but this is true to all SUV's.

Rear Buckets cut hauling area in half, they don't fold.
and center console is not removable.
