              I had high hopes when I received my Discovery for the month.  Unfortunately those hopes diminished quickly. 
  At first I was impressed by the luxury and the little amenities of the Discovery.  However, the little quirks in the design came out quickly.  To begin with, I could not get comfortable in the driver's seat.  Even with the seat in the lowest position, and the steering wheel in the highest, I had only about an inch and a half space between the wheel and my legs.  (I am 5'11, 190lbs)  This position quickly got annoying.
  I was greatly disappointed in the power of the discovery.  Weighing in at close to 6500 pounds with only 188 horses and not much torque, this is not a freeway friendly SUV.  Forget about passing anyone over 50mph.  I think the 0-60 time is somewhere in the minutes (At least it felt that way).  Now to be fair, I will note that when you are off road, speed is not a necessity.  Land Rover ranks right up there with Jeep as an off road legend.  This 4wd will get you where you need to go, in comfort.  It just wont get you there quickly.
  The third row seating is impressive in design, but lacks in comfort.  The only problem I had with the design of the third row was that the seats could not be taken out.  These seats should only be used by children.  They lack the space and comfort for an adult.  There is no foot well, so your knees end up in your chest.  It was comfortable for about 3 minutes before I started to feel pain.
  The total for the Discovery II SE goes for about $40k.  For about $7k less you can get a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  Which in my opinion is a much better vehicle and 4wd, with better amenities than the Discovery.
  Bottom line, I was not impressed at all.  I came away disappointed in Land Rover.
