            I recently went with my aunt to purchase her QX4.  The QX4 has several problems with the SUV, however she still purchased the truck.  The engine in the Qx4 is ridiculously small and the horsepower put out is drastically small. The SUV is really slow off the line, even for SUV standards.  The interior is nice, but it is ruined by the loud engine noise you will hear after having the truck for about 3 months.  My Blazer out performs the QX4 in many driving situations.  The only good feature is that the QX4 has great turning radius.  It turns very well for an SUV. The cargo area is quite small, being covered by the plastic shield, that is located in the wrong place for efficency.  IT is a hassle to create more space by moving it. The dash is hard to use, too many weird locations for buttons.  The room on the inside is small, fitting 5 is not very comfortable. Furthermore, Infinity charges way too much for the extras, cd, air, etc.  You can get all that stuff for half the price.  The fuel economy is not great, all SUVs are that way.  Yes it is an Infinity, but still is shouldn't cost 35,000.  This price is almost as ridiculous as the 4-Runner.  The for price you are better off getting a Yukon or Tahoe.  They both are way better SUVs.  Thats why I say that you're wasting your money if you buy a Qx4<br><br>
