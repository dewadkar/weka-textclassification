            I was until recently the owner of a 1996 Camry LE 4 cylinder sedan.  I bought it mainly due to the model's outstanding reputation for quality and reliability, but soon realized that such virtues do not mean so much to me as I had thought.  

This car is astoundingly boring to drive.  As nice as it was to speculate that mechanical breakdowns were less probable for my Camry than for most other cars, the risk-taker within me rebelled at the thought of going hundreds of thousands of miles in this car.  I became an intense existentialist and concluded life is far to short to drive a camry.  It handled like a boat and practically refused to accelerate with two or three crewpeople aboard.  

Thus, if power, even merely for the sake of safety, is an issue for you, I would recommend test-driving the 4 cylinder under a full or nearly full load.  The 6 cylinder version presents a viable alternative, of course.  On the other hand, it will still handle like a boat.  And it is particularly hard to &quot;bond&quot; with a car so blandly styled and commonly seen on just about every street in the country. 

Positives include decent brakes (even quick stops on wet pavement were short and easy to control), easy-to-use controls, and easy-to-find parts.  Good mileage and the likelihood of trouble-free service make the car a good choice for getting from point a to b then back and back again...  but if you have even a little bit of driving enthusiasm lurking beneath your oh so conscious practicality, take heed.           <br><br>
