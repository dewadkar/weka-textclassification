            I bought this van because of the accolades heaped upon it by the press.  I was disappointed from the beginning.  

First of all, the gas gauge has never been accurate.  You better be near a gas station when it gets to 1/8th of a tank.  I took it into the dealership during the first couple of weeks to get it checked out, of course they found no problem.

Second, the sliding door hinges needed to be replaced during the first year, and they are going out again, but this time it will be on my nickel to fix them.

Third, the power steering pump has been noisy from the beginning.  Again, took it to get checked out and nothing wrong.

Fourth, it was running hot during the first year, bad radiator cap.

Fifth, just after the warranty was up, 36,000 miles, the brakes were metal on metal.  Both rear caliper plungers on the inside were stuck and caused pads to wear prematurely.  Had to pay to have calipers rebuilt after 40,000 miles.  Non Dodge technician informed that they use cheap plungers and they have to rebuild Dodge Caravans frequently.

Sixth, again, just a three year old vehicle, the speed sensor in the transmission went out.  $187.

Seventh, passenger's window just quit working. 

Overall, I say this vehicle is a POS and I'm frantically trying to purchase a Honda Odyssey.  Paid $20,000+ for the vehicle three years ago and put 60K miles and it's only worth $10K if I'm lucky.  

This has soured me on Dodge....
