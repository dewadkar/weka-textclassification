            I am the owner of a 1994 Mitsubishi Mirage and I will not purchase another car like this. I have had nothing but problems with this car since I bought it 2 years ago.  The windows keep fogging up (Vent not placed in the appropriate places)and when you turn on the heater you about roast to death. The car sits to low to the ground so when it rains you have to make sure you driver slower than normal or you will hydroplane or even fishtail in it.  I have fishtailed before and I was driving below the speed limit.  I am the mother of two children and I honestly want people to know that this car is not safe for anyone.  you may ask why haven't I sold it or traded it?  I can't afford the payments on another car at this time. I do plan on getting a different car in about 2 years.  So, in the mean time I will continue to be careful and when I am able to purchase another car it won't be a  Mitsubishi Mirage.<br><br>
