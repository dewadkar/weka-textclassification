            This vehicle belongs to my dad, who like most people who buy a SUV felt he &quot;needed&quot; it.  Also like most SUV owners, he has never taken it off-roading(unless you consider a dirt road off-roading)  He traded his old bodystyle '91 GMC Jimmy on it.  A vehicle that preformed better in almost all areas.  

One of the biggest complaints with this vehicle is the handling.  The suspension is very spongy.  There is a ton of body roll, the tires squeal loudly even when cornering slowly. Perhaps this is due to the street grade tires, but it is not a reassuring feeling.  I hate to drive it because of this.

My biggest personal complaint is the interior design.  (Note: this relates to the '95-'97 models only.  I have driven a '98 S-10 with the redesigned dash and can honestly say it is far superior in ergonomics and asthetics) The dash itself looks like it is constructed of an extremely low grade of plastic.  It is hard, not soft feeling like most other dashes.  It's possible it <b>IS</b> low grade as the molded map pockets in the front doors have cracked.  Or perhaps it looks &quot;cheaper&quot; than it is due to the cold shade of gray.  The interior door handles are awkwardly small.  The transmission shifter does not have a smooth feel to it(the transmission itself shifts smoothly, but when selecting a gear you really have to yank the shifter). 

On the bright side, there are plenty of storage areas inside.  Map pockets in all doors, and in the front seatbacks.  There are four cupholders, a good sized glovebox and plenty of storage in the console.  A negative is that neither the glovebox or the console can be locked, something that both did in the old bodystyle.  

The Blazer and Jimmy are about the only SUVs that still offer a real tailgate.  GM really seems to be pushing the liftgate recently, so I suspect that will change when the redesigned models come out.  Alot of people don't like the tailgate, but I do.  It is able to be opened in tight spaces like in the garage.  It also provides a great seat for fishing or watching fireworks, etc.

Bottom line, skip over this year and look for a '98 or newer Blazer, or at least test drive one and see how much difference the interior makes.<br><br>
