            OK. I bought the Saturn SC because I'd listened to the commercials, and thought they were a different kind of company. Well, this didn't go so well for me.

Initially, I loved the car. It was great. Good power from the size of the engine, nice handling, good looks.

Then things started going wrong. One of the headlamps stopped flipping up. When I took it in for service, they told this this was not covered by the warranty. WHAT? OK, I got it fixed elsewhere, since dealerships are VERY expensive.

I also complained about the plastic interior panels rattling against each other in a harmonic resonance to the engine. That was only covered during the initial 36k miles, so I had to live with that. 

Later, at about 125k miles, the seat broke. Right below my shoulderblades, the seat frame broke. There was a sharp piece of metal jabbing me in the back. I talked to my local Saturn dealership about this. They said that since I wasn't a &quot;good&quot; customer, getting them to do all my services and oil changes, etc, that they had no reason to do this for me. &gt;GOGGLE&lt; I called Saturn corporate, to request service on this. The customer service representative took my information, and I was never called back. I tried again, and again, I was never called back.

Eventually, I bought a seat from a wrecker, and installed it myself. Later, I donated the car to charity, since no one wanted to buy it from the listing in the paper. Good riddance.<br><br>
