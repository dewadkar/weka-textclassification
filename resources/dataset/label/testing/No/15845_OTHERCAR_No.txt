            <b>It would be a great vehicle if GM quality was better</b>
My dad bought the Suburban in Feb. of 1998 to replace your Jimmy. The Suburban is a great vehicle, and is by far my favorite vehicle that we own. But there is many problems with it that should not be happening with just 36,000 miles on it. 

<b>What I like about the Suburban</b>
The room is unbeliveable. Dad and me go up to Michigan several times a year, the the &quot;burb&quot; is the most comfortable vehicle to travel in. He does diving so we removed the 3rd row seats, and have plenty of room for his equipment. With the Jimmy, we would have to lay down the back seat and pile everything up to the roof to get it to fit.

The handling is great for the size of the truck. With the 5.7 Liter V8 it has great pickup, and power to pull your boats or trailers. The ride is smooth and does not have the body roll as the Jimmy does in sharp turns. 

The size is sometimes a problem, but you learn to live with it. It turns very sharp, which is nice for those tight parking lots. 

The gas mileage is very good for the size of the truck. We average around 15MPG city and 18MPG highway. We also have a 42 gallon tank which is nice for very long trips. 

<b>Now here is the list of problems</b>
I remind you that the truck is almost 3 years old and has just over 36,000 miles.

1. There is a noise the comes from the steering shaft. We have taken it to the dealer twice to fix it, which they did, after replacing several broken items. 

2. When taking off there would be a very loud pop from the bottom of the truck. This problem took the dealer three times to find. It turned out to be that the transmission mount were broke. 

3. Have had hit and miss trouble with the Transmission itself. Sometimes it will shift so hard that it sounds like someone is taking a hammer to it. If you turn the truck off and start it again it will be fine. Gm can't figure out what the problem is. 

4. Now the doors have started to make a dull popping noise when you hit a bump. Oil helps a little, but it is still there and drive you nuts. The bad thing is that all of the doors are beginning to do this. 


<b>Recommendation...</b>
It is a nice truck, when it is not in the dealer or popping at you when you go down the road. But, considering the problems that we have had with our (which I hope is a isolated case) I can not recommend this truck to anyone.<br><br>
