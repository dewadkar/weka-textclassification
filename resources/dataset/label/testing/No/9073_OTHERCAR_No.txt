                 My son bought the 1999 Kia Sportage because of the price compared to other SUV's. The problems started about 2 months after delivery, the 4-wheel drive would not engage, so we took it back for repair. Two months later it was back in for the same problem plus the passenger side windows leaked on both doors. 

    Had it taken back to fix the drivers side door seal for leakage and have the front disc brake pads replaced with only 7000 miles on it. Shortly after that ( 3 weeks) had it in for a noise that sounded like it was the transmission and the check engine light stayed on constantly


 The dealer could find nothing wrong with the transmission and said that the computer showed no error codes. Found out later they were not checking the computer with the engine running, which Kia sent a notice to us  and a sticker for us to attach to the dashboard that told them to check with the engine running.

     At 11,000 miles while on our way back from a football game, we stopped to get gas and when we started the Kia and released the clutch it made a loud grinding noise and would not move. We had it towed to the dealer which was 72 miles away and had to find a ride home because they would not take us with the Kia. So much for roadside assistance I did not know it meant leaving us by the roadside with no way home. It was the rear end that had blown a bearing and took a week to get parts and fix it.

     At 15,000 miles the front drivers side wheel bearing broke and we lost the front brakes, this took two weeks for parts and labor, the knuckle had to be shipped from Korea, and the front brake pads and calipers had to be replaced. When we called to make an appointment to get it repaired the service manager didn't even ask what was wrong he just said it would be about two weeks for repair, when I asked him if he wanted to know what was wrong with it he said &quot;It's the front wheel bearing&quot;.

   The check engine light still comes on and they can never figure out why.

    Although the Sportage is a nice looking vehicle, the numerous problems do not make it worth the money or aggravation.  <br><br>
