            I had a Ford Taurus that was a deathtrap so I went to a Ford dealership to buy a new car, thinking that they'd have to take it.   I was planning on getting a Ford Escort GT but they only come in stick shifts.   So the sales person steered me towards the Tempo.   The price was good and it was shiny new so I bought it.   I also bought the extended 50k warranty. 

Before the car hit 25k the fuel pump went.   Repaired for free.  Then the starter went.   Repaired for free.  Then it went again.   Free.   The third time was less then 6 months after #2 and they wanted me to pay a $50 deductible.    The boyfriend-type-man convinced them that they did NOT want to charge me.   The next time my car wouldn't start (similar situation to when the starters went) a friend suggested I put the car in neutral and let it roll - and it started!!   From that point on I was constantly rolling and starting it.   Looks stupid when you're not on an incline!    Finally the rolling technique stops working and I tell the Ford dealership to put in another starter.    They keep it for the day and say there's nothing wrong with it, the starter is $300 and do I really want it?     I take it home, and it promptly refuses to start.  I take it to the local car repair shop and they diagnose a starter cellanoid and fix it for $29.00.      

I also asked the Ford dealership to repair the stupid clicking noise the heater fan (which is constantly on) makes.    This is $200, and, of course I've already had this fixed.   The Ford guy just shrugs and says &quot;oh, these things keep breaking&quot;  like that means I should just keep paying for it??   

The car just turned 86k so I'm not happy about all of these repeat repairs, since I'm the one paying for them now!
