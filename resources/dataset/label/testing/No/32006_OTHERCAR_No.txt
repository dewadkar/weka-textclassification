            I won this camera at a conference, otherwise, I would have never purchased it.  I like a camera that allows you to take quick pictures as things are really happening.  This camera does not allow that.  You have to select options and settings and focus and zoom and determine resolution....by the time you do all of that, whatever you wanted to photograph is long gone.  

If you don't take your pictures with a super fine resolution, they are too grainy to be of any use.  Now, that may not sound like a big deal, but with the 4 MB memory card that comes with the camera, this only gives you about 5 pictures.  I would venture to guess that most of us would want to take more than 5 pictures before having to visit the PC to download.  

I also found that the batteries do not last very long, even if you aren't using the LCD window the whole time.
