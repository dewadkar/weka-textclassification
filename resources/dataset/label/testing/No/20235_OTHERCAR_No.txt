            My wife and I recently got into a new lease of a 1999 Chevrolet Malibu. Overall I'm fairly pleased with the car, but I do have some reservations. I would definitely not recommend getting the base model of the car. The main reason for this is horrible gas mileage due to a smaller engine having to pull the same vehicle weight as the larger engine. I'm getting a good 10-15 mpg less than advertised on the window sticker.

My other problem with my experience with the Malibu is the support of Chevrolet. I took the car into the dealership a month after we had the car and complained about the mileage I was receiving. They said the mileage I was getting was good and I should be happy with it. I told them I'm lucky to get 250 miles on my 15 gallon tank. At the low end of the spectrum, I should be getting 375 miles to a tank. I was basically made to feel like I was an idiot and 16 mpg is great mileage for a new car. Baloney!!!

It's a nice car and is very roomy for a family car. The trunk is massive, which has definitely come in handy with a new baby. Stroller fits in there with absolutely no problem. Plenty of room for 3-4 good sized suitcases too.<br><br>
