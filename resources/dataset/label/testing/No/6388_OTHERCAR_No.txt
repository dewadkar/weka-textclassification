            The XC 90 has been a disappointment for me. 
I choose the XC 90 after hours of research, and it was clear that it was the most thoughtfully designed SUV.  It trumped its competition in a variety of ways: it's voluminous inside, yet it feels compact while driving; the interior is intuitive and elegantly spartan; the seats are comfortable; the power is impressive, if not gas thirsty; the navigation is the most effective and thoughtful in the business; and the exterior design drew me in like a siren. 
While the XC 90 was thoughtfully designed, it was obviously poorly assembled.  After spending over $50k on a car, and having to wait for months for it to arrive, you have certain expectations for quality.  Those expectations were not met.  Upon my first experience with my vehicle, I found brushed aluminum accents opposed to wood-trim.  All 2003 T6's had wood trim; alas, what was shipped for me was a 2004 model.  I wasn't given a choice or even a heads-up of Volvo's cost cutting design.  
After driving my Volvo for only a week, I had multiple leaks!  It took three trips and over a week in the shop for Volvo to determine that my power steering fluid was leaking and that I needed to replace the device.  
Other problems were legion.  I expect rattles and strange sounds to emanate from lesser cars, but for the money, I expect silence.  Volvo had to swap out components from my noisy sun roof, and they're still looking for the rumblings inside the dash.  Even the turbo is strangely noisy: with each release of the throttle the turbo loudly releases the built up pressure.  Strange that other turbo cars have found ways to mute that.  
I've logged over 10,000 miles on my Volvo, and now the breaks are squeaking.  I've scheduled yet another appointment with the service team.  
My recommendation: find a German or Japanese car that offers the same refinement without the stress of worrying about build quality.
