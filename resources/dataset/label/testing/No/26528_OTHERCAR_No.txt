            My 1997 S-10 has 66k miles on it. Most of it highway miles. So far the following has been or needs replaced:
CV joints.
Brakes (front)
Windshield (cracked while driving at 30 mph)
Wiper motor.
Shocks (rear)
Seat belts (recall)
This model has 4 cylinders &amp; manual transmission. It is way underpowered especially when the truck is loaded. I get anywhere from 17-20 mpg. Using the air conditioner robs a lot of power &amp; makes the engine run much louder. The automatic ventilation runs warm in the summer. The warm air blows out the bottom vents. The only way to stop it is to use the air conditioner.<br><br>
