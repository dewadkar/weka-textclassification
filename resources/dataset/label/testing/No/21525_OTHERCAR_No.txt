            My wife and I recently purchased the Grand Cherokee 2002 2WD. So far the car has been a pleasure to drive. However today my wife experienced a mechanical breakdown while driving back to work on her lunch break. We don't quite no what the problem is as of yet. The on-board "MIL" light came on when she was at the top of a hill, rendering the car powerless. She was lucky that there wasnt any traffic coming from behind her. The roadside assistance worked pretty good, the tow truck showed up in about an hour. Over all the car has been pretty good. It has a lot of power if you are used to driving a 4 cylinder like we were. I definitely would get another one and definitely if you plan on getting a Jeep, invest in the best extended warranty that is offered. Our Jeep only has 700 miles on it, who knows what will happen in say 1 or 2 years.
