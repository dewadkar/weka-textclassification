            I wanted a reliable cross functional vehicle and the Sonoma fit the bill, or at least I thought it would. I have owned over 20 new vehicles in my life and the Sonoma is by far the worst I have ever owned.  The day I brought it home from the dealer the A/C quit and the speedometer stuck at 32 MPH. There were many problems since but the problem that was never fixed after four trips to the dealer was a rear differential howl. The howling sounds like an owl and a morning dove riding along in the bed. The noise becomes even worse at cold temperatures. I tried for over a year to get this fixed and it is obviously above the spectrum of customer service. Not having the time to get an attorney and file a lemon law suit, I pledged to GM that I would never buy another vehicle from them and I will stand by my word.<br><br>
