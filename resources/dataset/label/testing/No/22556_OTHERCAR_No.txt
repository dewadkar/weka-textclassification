            We bought our 1993 Mazda MPV about 18 months ago because we were expecting our third child (and a third car seat).  When we bought it, it only had 50K miles, seemed to be in good running condition, and the interior and exterior had been kept in excellent condition.  We really felt that we were getting a great deal at $8000 and thought that it would last us at least a few years.  

Within three months, we started to notice a loud clicking noise whenever we drove the van.  The mechanic inspected it and said that Mazdas are known for this problem.  It was the rocker arm and shaft, and that it would cost $1200 to replace.  After getting a second opinion, we learned that changing the oil very frequently (at least every three months) would get rid of the clicking noise and help prevent it from coming back, BUT it would eventually need to be fixed.

Then a couple of months later, the engine check light went on.  We took it to the shop and learned that oil had been leaking and had damaged a number of parts.  Numerous hoses, gaskets, seals and o-rings needed to be replaced, and we also opted to have the timing belt and water pump replaced, since it would have to be done in the near future anyway.  That repair cost us a little over $1300, and we were without a car for a week.

A short month or so later, the brake light started coming on.  We checked the brake fluid like it said to do in the manual, and it was at an acceptable level.  So, we took it into the shop again.  They looked into the problem and said that it just needed more brake fluid (don't know why, because it was already at an acceptable level).  That visit cost us $150.

Then about three months later, the brake light started coming on again.  Learning from our last shop visit, we just poured some brake fluid into the chamber.  The light went out, and it seemed to be working okay.

A couple of weeks ago, the car wouldn't start, stranding my husband and two young children at the shopping center.  It was only the starter, which was easily replaced, and cost us just over $100.

Now, five months after our major engine repair, the check engine light is starting to flicker on and off again.  We are at 70K miles right now, so it's not coming on for the 80K servicing.  We were getting very tired of fixing the van so often and asked a relative who fixes cars to take a look at it.  He recommended that we sell the car while we still can.  We also noticed that the muffler and exhaust pipe is no longer secure and is dangling.  The clicking noise is also coming back just as loud as ever and just changing the oil doesn't seem to be working as well anymore.

We took our relative's advice and bought a new van.  Since our van had so many problems, we had decided to trade it in at the car dealer.  The salesman was very straight forward with us and mentioned that they know Mazda MPV's have a lot of problems.  Therefore, they pay between $1500-$2000 less than the wholesale blue book value for the trade in.

Other problems:  When driving up hills, the valves knock very badly (even after a tune-up) and it has hardly any power, even though it's a V6.

Needless to say, we will never be buying a Mazda MPV again!
