<TEXT>
             I recently purchased a 99 Kia Sportage, and it has been O.K. I don't think very highly of Kia,but it has been fairly good.The gas tank has been in the shop numerous times for minor things.Excessive noise is a problem maybe because the accelleration  is below average.All in all I think the Sportage is worth a look but do not attend to buy it yet,test drive the CR V and RAV4 and see how those are.. Then get back to Kia and then you deside what is the best.I bought this vehcile because it was very cheap and offered standard features.Oh, and antoher thing the Sportage is a 4 cyl, I was hoping they could put a V6 in the little utes.The RAV4 now has a V6.Oh, yea back the Sportage, the Sportage is fairly a good vechile consumer reports didnt care for it .Maybe because  small utes is suppose to be like the MID size SUVs, and the CR-V is the closest to that matter... THE SPORTAGE IS A GOOD CAR BUT I WOULDNT RECCOMEND BECAUSE KIA NEEDS TO WORK ON SOME THINGS.<br><br>
