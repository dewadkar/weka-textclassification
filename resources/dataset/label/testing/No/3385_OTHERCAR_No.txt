            I can not speak for the hard top LeBaron, I have a convertible 2 door, but no matter how cute this car is its very poorly made.  Having graduated from College with an Industrial Engineering degree, and having a husband with a Mechanical Aerospace Engineering degree and a Dad with a Civil Engineering degree, I feel that I am an educated judge of products.  

I have owned this car since 1995 when I purchased it in my freshman year of college.  I was taken with its cute factor, and the idea of owning a convertible, and made the mistake of doing no research.  Pretty silly for such a big purchase, but I did it and now I am living with it.  Six months after my purchase I was hit with the consequences of my mistake.  My transmission started acting funny.  After several month of this happening only when I was far away from my mechanic, I finally was able to show him the problem.  He was not familiar with my type of transmission (computerized) and referred me to a dealer or transmission specialist.  In speaking with more than several transmission specialty shops all over Tulsa I found out the truth.  Chrysler had a five year period (89-93?) where it was experimenting with computerized transmissions.  Around 1993 they noticed that 100% of the 1989 LeBarons needed transmission replacements.  Turns out they had a deign flaw that caused the transmissions in LeBarons for this time period to need overhaul after only 5 years of use.  I don't know about you but I consider 5 year to be much to soon to replace a transmission.  To add insult to injury Chrysler refused to admit fault or pay for the repairs when I called their customer service line.  After talking until I was blue in the face to a high level manager of customer service I got them to pay only 50% of the cost of parts.  As anyone knows, parts on a transmission overhaul cost nothing compared to the labor.  Strike Number One and $1200 later.

Another year went by after this incident, no transmission problems thank God.  One morning I was getting ready to leave, and when I got to my car I noticed cuts on the top.  At first I thought some kid had tried to break into my car and called the police.  When the Police looked at the cuts, they determined that vandalism for theft could not be the culprit.  I took that at face value because they gave me good reasons for this diagnosis, all of which made sense to me.  I began the task of taking my car to body shops to get several estimates and a feel for the integrity of the staff. 
Some simply told me it would cost $1500 to replace the top completely, but gave no reason why the tears were present.  Others got honest with me.  I heard yet another story of Chrysler's bad design and refusing to admit fault.  Apparently Chrysler filed the frame for their Convertible LeBarons so sharp that after opening and closing the top for several years, all LeBaron from 89-93 (at least) had cuts in the exact same places I did.  Look at these older style LeBarons on the road.  If they have not fixed their top they will have open slits on the driver side and passenger side just forward of the rear window.  Lots of Lebaron owners have placed duct tape over them as well.  Strike 2 and $500 later (I found a guy that I trusted and was very fair with me).

Throughout the ritual of changing my oil with my dad and husband I have noticed that the under side of the car is also designed poorly.  For example sensitive parts that, if damaged risk leaking, are placed far up front so that if you pull too far forward on a curb you have a strong chance of denting and damaging them.  Strike 3.

Just like Baseball, three strikes and you are out.  I would not recommend this car to anyone, and would even go so far as to say DO NOT BUY A CRYSLER, JEEP, EAGLE, PLYMOUTH, AND DODGE PRODUCT!!! Not just because they design poorly, but because they refuse to admit it and make it right to their customers.  I don't care if they were taken over or not.  This is a culture, and it is hard to break once it is instilled in employees.  Be weary and research your heart out before buying a car, especially a Chrysler, Plymouth, Jeep, Eagle, or Dodge product.
