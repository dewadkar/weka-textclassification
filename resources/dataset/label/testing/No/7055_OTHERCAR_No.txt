            I used to own a 1994 Mazda 626 ES.  I finally traded it in on a 2000 Neon which I love.  With 41,000 miles my transmission went out and had to be rebuilt.  At 78,000 miles it has went belly up again.  Mazda denies any problems with their transmissions yet the Technical Service Bulletins(Silent recalls) on my car alone have 12 bulletins dealing with the transmission!  At $3000 a pop, replacing your transmission every 40,000 miles is not my idea of a good car.  In the 2 years I've had my car, I've replaced the trans once and am getting ready to do it again, replaced the left side drivers power window motor, replaced a left side valve cover gasket, water pump, timeing belt and changed the tires every year.  To others that have this car, GET RID OF IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!!!  Email i4get@i-plus.net to get in on a Class Action Suit if you have reciepts of repairs on your Mazda Transmission.<br><br>
