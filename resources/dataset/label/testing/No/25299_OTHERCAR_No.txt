            I bought this camera when I was passing through Dubai and I thought I was getting a great deal.  I hadn't done any shopping though I'd heard from my cousin that the Coolpix series was good.  So for $520, I bought the camera and started taking photos.

I was extremely unhappy to find out that my batteries barely lasted more than perhaps 12 pictures, taking an average amount of time to compose and set up a picture.  Perhaps I need to use the rechargeables.

Since I did not have a CD-ROM drive with my laptop at the time, the instruction manual was close to useless as much of the information necessary to operate the camera is on a CD.

I was extremely pleased to be able to remove the 8MB memory card, put it in an adapter and slide it into my PC card slot on my laptop.  This beats having to use cables and another piece of software to download the information.

I've started taking my photos in the VGA format in manual because otherwise the pictures are typically too big and too large to send.....when you're overseas and typically have to deal with dial up connections that aren't more than 28.8, a 65k file is much easier to send than one with 400K.

I'm making the best of the situation.  I don't have time to figure out all the ins and outs of the product, but when I read through other EPINIONS, I suppose I learn about things I should try.  Either way, it still takes nice pictures.<br><br>
