            Okay, so call me a car freak (enthusiast, in a more politically correct world). But, the Toyota Camry wagon, in all its 4-cylinder, 125 horsepower glory, isn't but an ashtray with extra features such as wheels, seats, engine and a chassis... in case of the stationwagon, add shopping trolly to the pot.

My parents own one, and whenever I don't use my car, I sometimes am forced to use this, but every time I do it makes me cringe. Countless times I have managed to corner at a fastish speed, only to have the back end slide out on me, and leave me in a hurry to correct it the best I can. The fact that it's a stationwagon, with a huge back and obviously a very high center of gravity that's been pushed back, and small wheels, as well as being a front-wheel drive, this is not made for anything but shopping.

Its drive is quite atrocious, the power snapping on like a light switch, and the front wheels spinning whenever there's hint of dampness on the road, and you're in &quot;I can't believe I'm making a 120 horsepower car wheelspin&quot; territory. 

Also its features are just about average - the single good point to make about the interior is the fantastic air conditioning.. probably handy if you live in Texas, but really, you couldn't get very far with it so Texas isn't the place to be. :)

Its only saving graces, and why it sells better than I believe it ever should, are the price, and the size of the monster. It is absolutely HUGE, and the price of itself and the parts are quite affordable for any car, typical of economical Toyota 'family' cars (hate to be in that family Toyota envisions). 

So, my advice if you're looking for something to do your shopping in, or take you and your partner to golf courses once a week, and don't have a lot of money, the Camry might be actually a reasonable choice. Otherwise, I don't see any use for it, anywhere, at any point in history.<br><br>
