            In late 1997 it came time to purchase a new car.  It was a toss-up between a Honda Civic and VW Jetta diesel.  What I was looking for was simple:

1) RELIABLE transportation
2) EXCELLENT fuel economy

Doing my homework, it appeared that either of my final two choices would deliver.  I decided on the Jetta because of the reputation of the diesel engine.

When I first bought the car, I loved it.  It had an excellent ride, handled very well in all types of weather, and was very roomy.

The problems began about 2 years after purchase.  I've had the car into the dealer for so many things, I thought I'd list the two most important (and expensive).  You can read other opinions on here about parts falling off (such as moldings, etc) these have happened to me as well.

1) Manual transmission, blew out reverse gear

In all seriousness, how often do you use reverse?  Well, mine started going at about 100,000 km, and completely went a short time after.  I still haven't had it repaired, my principles stop me - see next point.

2) Injection pump (2 of them!) and injectors

My injection pump completely failed at 150,000 km.  The final repair bill came to $3745.55 (I previously had this listed at $2745.55 but I forgot about the $1000 deposit on my Visa!!).  I was not impressed!  The car is only 3 years old!!!  I took the car home, and it was stalling all the way.  The next morning, I took the car back to the dealer, and the pump seized while running in the parking lot!  To top it off, the dealer kept my car for three weeks (they gave me a &quot;courtesy&quot; car - read RENTAL car!!) and wanted me to pay another $1200 for another pump!  After arguing with the OWNER of the dealership for an hour and a half, he finally agreed to pay for the pump, but dinged me $800+ for the use of their &quot;courtesy&quot; car!

Along with these problems, I've replaced the injectors once (just previous to point #2), the glow plugs several times, and fuel filters several times (probably twice as often as one would expect from &quot;regular maintenance&quot;).

To sum this all up (and to make an extremely long and agonizing story short) this car has been nothing but a headache!  Not to mention the lack of respect from the dealership.  I have called VW before stating my frustrations, and all they could say was &quot;Sorry to lose you as a customer&quot;.  I have written to them, but have not received any response.

The amount paid shown below is converted to US... I paid $21000 Canadian $.
