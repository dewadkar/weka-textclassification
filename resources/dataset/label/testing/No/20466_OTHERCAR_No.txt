            OK - so sue me - I traded in my gas-sipping Toyota on a luminescent maroon 1996 Chevy Lumina.

A happy-go-lucky bachelor for a few years, I enjoyed tooling around in my small economical 4-cylinder Toyota.  

Then it happened - "SHE" came into my life, and brought two early-teenage children with her.  Of course, after the wedding, the Toyota was suddenly too small for my new-found transportation needs.  After shopping and comparing and shopping some more, we found a clean (then) 1-year old 1996 Chevy Lumina.  It was love at first site.

The Lumina has 4 doors, a 3.1-litre V6, automatic, cold A/C, and power amenities to spoil me and my new family.  It also has quite an appetite for gasoline - we get @ 20 MPG City / 35 Hwy (The Toyota got 35 City, and upper 40's on the Hwy).  Of course, I bought the extended warranty - I rarely allow anyone to talk me into add-on sales, but this time, I must have had my guard down...

We have had the Lumina nearly 4 years now.  We love it and we hate it at the same time.  Did I mention that I bought the extended warranty?

The Lumina is a great car to drive - it handles well, has (usually) adequate acceleration, great ABS brakes, and is comfortable enough to take the whole family on weekend and holiday outings of a few hundred miles at a time.  

Being the proud owners of this fine American-made automobile, we have taken great care in maintaining the car to manufacturer's recommendations - all services performed in a timely fashion by highly trained (ie: highly paid) professionals at the dealership.

Did I mention that I bought the extended warranty?

Now for the bad news. (Wow - am I glad that I bought the extended warranty!!!)  This Lumina has had the following components replaced at the dealership, after the factory 36k warranty expired, and before hitting 60k on the odometer:

- water pump 
- power window motor - left front
- power door lock - left front
- alternator
- daylight sensor for daytime running lights
- oxygen sensor
- new computer chip (de-braining didn't work)

This Lumina has had the following services performed at the dealership, after the factory 36k warranty expired, and before hitting 60k on the odometer:

- Rear brakes cleaned and adjusted 4 times in two years (they still sound like a rock tumbler most of the time, but they sure do stop great)
- Fuel injectors cleaned (very expensive!)
- Fuel filter changed
- On-board computer chip had to be "de-brained" and reset (when the oxygen sensor was replaced)

Did I mention I am glad I bought the extended warranty?

The next item on the list to be replaced is the engine.  It ticks like a time bomb for @ 5 minutes after a cold start, and misses irritably at idle even when warmed up.  The dealership informed me (at 39k miles when I first noticed the problem) that GM would replace the engine if it were still under factory warranty (36k miles).  However, since it was out of factory warranty, GM no longer had any interest in the vehicle.  Of course, the extended warranty company says that they won't replace the engine or individual components due only to cold-start noise or miss at idle.  So I drive it daily, taking care to not push her too hard -  we still have another year left on the extended warranty - I hope it lasts that long.

Will I buy another Chevrolet Lumina - probably not.  I know where there is a Honda dealer - I think I might try their products next time... I wonder what they'll give me for a trade in?
