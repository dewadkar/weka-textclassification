            I bought a 1995 Chev. Blazer LT used in 1999. It only had 43,000 miles on it and got a clean bill of health from 2 mechanics. Within 6 months i have replaced...
1. fuel injection system
2. shocks
3. exhaust system
4. multiple light bulbs and small parts
5. brakes
6. stabilizer bar in suspension
This is just a partial listing of the problems that I have encountered.
Never again will I buy a chevy product!!!!!!!!!!!!
I traded in a 1991 Ford explorer with 120,000 miles on it and as a trade in they offered me only 500 less than what I paid for it over 2 years before. The difference in reliability was amazing. I thought that I was trading up and receiving a more reliable car. Was I mistaken!<br><br>
