            I bought my 96 Mystique brand new in February 1996 because I loved the look, the price was right and it drove nice.  Unfortunately, I am totally disappointed that I ever bought this vehicle.  The lemon problem is something that I've been plagued with since the onset. I've had emissions problems w/the 3&amp;4 cylinder of this vehicle just dropping out right during rush hour traffic, I've had wheel bearings go at 60,000 and now at 100,000 miles the transmission is shot!  The best part about it is that this was totally unavoidable by me because this vehicle has a &quot;non-serviceable&quot; transmission!  Considering I still owe a bunch of money on this car, this latest problem is nothing short of disgusting.  Did Ford Lincoln/Mercury set out to deliberately deceive potential customers?<br><br>
