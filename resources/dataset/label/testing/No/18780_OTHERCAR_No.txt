            I am a single mom of two little boys and saving money to me is very important.  I chose the Kia Sephia primarily because of the price and I thought it was an attractive, reliable car. I was really wrong!  Thankfully I paid for an extended warranty on the car because I have had nothing but problems.  The first month after purchasing this car, things stared to break down.  I have had this car for a year and it has been in the shop almost every month of that year.  I am desperately trying to unload this car and they depreciate so fast that I am now &quot;up-side-down&quot;. The dealer was rude and not helpful at all and i would NOT recommend buying this car to anyone.  I think if they backed up their product and worked on customer service skills, I might have a better opinion but for now I am very dissatisfied.<br><br>
