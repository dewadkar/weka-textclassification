            My husband and I bought a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee in 1998.  We absolutely loved the way that it drove, the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; that went along with the car (meaning that it was fully loaded) along with the pristine condition that it was in.  However, not four months after the purchase of this vehicle it was in the shop for a new drive shaft.  About eight months after that we had it in the shop again for a new transfer case, braking system as well as a new transmission.  While waiting at the dealership  for this previously stated repair to finish, we spoke with another Jeep owner of a slightly younger Jeep who stated that her Jeep was also in constant repair.  We are getting ready to take this same Jeep into the repair shop yet again for an &quot;engine stopping&quot; problem.  I think that three-strikes and you are out.  I think that Jeep is a wonderful product, however I do feel that there are some lemons on the line.  One is sitting in our driveway.<br><br>
