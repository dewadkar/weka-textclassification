            I purchased a 1996 Ford Taurus program car with 18,000 miles on it.  From day 1, I have regretted that decision and will until I am rid of this lemon.  I use my vehicles heavily and in the last year and a half, I have put 60,000 miles on it.  I maintain my vehicles well, but for this car, it didn't matter.  
In 1 1/2 years, I have replaced the entire front-end assembly three (3) times, replaced the transmission, and replaced the cam sensor due to hard starting.  None of these repairs have fixed any of the problems with this P.O.S.  I have written several letters to Ford to express my deep displeasure and concern with an inferior product and to my dismay, no responses were ever given.  It is easy to see that Ford is perfectly happy to create an inferior product to sell to the U.S. public.
No way would I ever recommend to anyone a Ford Taurus (I have a 1996 and have driven a 1999).  The only good quality this vehicle has is that the ride is very smooth, although the front end assembly clunks when you hit the slightest of bumps.<br><br>
