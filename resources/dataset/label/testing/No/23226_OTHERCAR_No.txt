            My husband choose to buy a Plymouth Breeze because of it's size.  He was impressed by the amount of driver and back seat leg room.  The car was also priced several thousand dollars lower than it's closest competition.  He purchased the car new and immediately experienced problems.  He had to have the transmission worked on several times.  The engine had to be replaced at 20,000 miles. The car frequently overheated.  He also has had problems with the air conditioning and the control dials will not always light up. While most of these problems occurred early and were fixed under the factory warranty, it was still a disappointing experience for his first new car.
