Here's a  vehicle thats been a hot seller in North America at the time and that was my reason for buying this product. I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IN THE FALL OF 1993.
WELL LET ME TELL YOU I DON'T THINK I WOULD EVER BUY ANOTHER CHRYSLER PRODUCT AGAIN.IF
I SOUND DISAPPOINTED, I DEFINITELY AM. MY
VAN AS OF JULY 1999 HAS ONLY 90,000 KM AND THESE HAVE BEEN THE PROBLEMS; TRANSMISSION
OVERHAULED AFTER ONE YEAR ($3,200 CAN./UNDER WARRANTY).BRAKE PROBLEM MASTER CYLINDER LEAK FRONT(MORE WARRANTY WORK). AIR CONDITIONING COMPLETELY FRIED AFTER TWO YEARS REPLACED AGAIN AFTER COMPLAINING TO CHRYSLER COVERED BY WARRANTY.(THIRD A/C UNIT JUSTED REPLACED THIS WEEK $1225,NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY). REAR HATCH THAT WOULD OPEN ON ITS OWN WHILE DRIVING . CHRYSLER REPAIRED AND INSTALLED NEW LATCH MECHANISM. WATER LEAK AT BACK HATCH . PREMATURE RUSTING AT BASE OF REAR HATCH WINDOW. RADIO CASSETTE TOAST AFTER 3RD YEAR. FRONT DRIVER SEAT LOOSE AFTER SIX MONTHS .FRONT END LOOSE AND WOBBLELY AFTER ONE YEAR.
CAR RATTLES TO HELL. AS OF LAST WEEK I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE FRONT AIR BAGS ALSO HAVE A MIND OF THERE OWN, MORE RECALLS. GET THE PICTURE. THE LIST GOES ON. I LOVE TO HELP THE ECONOMY BY BUYING NORTH AMERICAN, BUT UNFORTUNITELY EVERY YEAR AMERICAN CAR COMPANIES ALWAYS SAY QUALITY CONTROL  COMPARES TO JAPANEESE CARS. ALSO BEING AN OWNER OF A NISSAN AND NOW A LEXUS, CHRYSLER NEEDS DO TO ALOT TO GET MY BUSINESS BACK.I'M CURRENTLY TRYING TO DISCOURAGE MY SISTER FROM BUYING A NEW CHRYSLER VAN AS I FEAR SHE WILL BE PLAQUED BY SIMILAR PROBLEMS AS MENTIONED ABOVE.......................... PS, THANKS EPINIONS.COM THIS IS THE TYPE OF SERVICE I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR , REAL COMPARITIVE SHOPPING, GOOD LUCK.
