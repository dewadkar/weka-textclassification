               <b>M</b>emorial Day is usually celebrated by doing something special with family members, friends, and of course while remembering and honoring all the Veterans. This last Memorial day my friends and I made the ultimate plan to drive down to Leggett California (located 190 miles north of San Francisco) and go swimming in the 'expected' 90 degree heat. The only problem was, we did not have a vehicle to drive that would fit all 6 of us inside. We could have taken two cars, but that would separate us all, which causes tension etc. Solution... Get friends' roommates 1992 Chevy Astro Van.

  <b>F</b>or 1992 the Chevy Astro van comes in 3 trim lines, the passenger van (the van this review is based on), the cargo van, and the extended passenger van (available in RWD and AWD). Once offered with a standard four cylinder back in the 80's, with a 4.3 V6 as an option, the '92 models only come with V6's. The top of the line engine is the HO (high output) 4.3 liter OHV V6 that pumps out 200 horsepower, while the base engine, which powered my vacation commuter, came equipped with a 4.3 liter OHV V6 that offers 150 HP @ 4,000 RPM, and 230 lb-ft of torque at an almost 'idle' 2,400 RPM.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

  Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b>, to be honest, was terrible. 150 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque seems like adequate horsepower, but with 7 people in a van that already weighs over 4,000 lbs, acceleration came slow and with a great deal of right foot action. After the Astro gets up to 40 MPH the situation gets worse. The curb weight of the Astro, the poor aerodynamics, and the clunky transmission come into play. At 40-50 MPH, the Astro's 4- speed automatic will automatically shift into high gear offering very little power unless you manually shift the gear selector out of OD, or just floor the gas pedal. The transmission, unlike most vehicles, does not down-shift until you floor the accelerator pedal. 

<b>Handling</b> is another down-side to this van. 'Turn in' is poor, poor tire grip, and body lean can be quite alarming. This van is relatively large, and feels even larger when driving it. I love taking the scenic route on 'Old highway 101,' but after a few corners in this van I chose to take the less twisty freeway. 

<b>Cruising</b> in the Chevy Astro is good in some respects, but the Astro has its major downfalls in this category as well. The '92 Astro Van offers smooth cruising on straight roads, but alas the Astro falls short when it comes to hill climbing, especially while trying to tackle steep freeway hills. I found myself flooring the gas pedal, down-shifting out of OD just to find myself holding steady at 55 MPH. I was tempted to down-shift into 2nd, but in the end decided against it, as I was afraid the engine and or transmission would suffer severe damage (6 young women stranded in the middle of nowhere is a bad scene). The Astro van is affected by wind, slight engine, road noise under normal cruising, and could use some help with the bumpy roads. 

<b>Braking</b>, despite having 4-wheel ABS, was only adequate, and when driving through town I found myself using my left foot almost as much as my right. 

<b>Fuel economy</b> was also very poor, despite this van just having a tune-up, and only having 98,000 miles on the odometer, I averaged about 16 MPG. 

<b>Note:</b> The '92 Astro Van has a payload of 1,857 lbs, and can tow up to 6,000 lbs, and is rear wheel drive.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

  The <b>interior</b> of the 1992 Chevy Astro Van is yet another downfall for this van. Ergonomics were confusing for me. The instrument cluster looked very out-dated, and the dash had an overall cheap plasticy look/feel to it. Plastic is abundant in this vehicle, in-fact I have never seen so much plastic in a single vehicle other than my father's 1987 model. Plastic can be made to look and feel quite fancy in many cases, but the plastic in the '92 Astro van looks like it was taken from a child's toy. The drivers position, while offering good outward, and rear vision is too high so it almost feels like you are driving a small school bus. Amenities are far and few between in base models, but this van came fully loaded with AC, tilt steering, power everything, a 4 speaker AM/FM cassette player that sounded awful, and cruise control; air Bags are not available. On a positive note, the '92 Astro Van boasts plenty of room for all passengers and driver. The cloth seats are also relatively comfortable, and the driver and front passenger seats came with manual lumbar adjustments, but no height adjustments. The Astro offers plenty of cargo room, the rear seats can be removed (they do not fold down) to provide good hauling space. The '92 Chevy Astro comes with dual swing out doors, 1 sliding door, and 2 doors for the driver and front passenger.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

  The <b>exterior</b> of the 1992 Chevy Astro van looks almost exactly the same way it did in 1985; a small version of a regular conversion van. The body has not changed whatsoever, and the boxy appearance remains. The head lamps are 'old fashioned' and are not flush like many other mini vans of the same time period.  


<b>Reliability issues:</b> These are the problems this Van has had since '92.

1. new alternator
2. new starter
3. 3 sets of tires
4. water pump replaced
5. new muffler
6. 4 sets of new brake pads
7. power steering leaks
8. oil leaks
9. peeling paint

<i>Price:</i>

 New, these vans ran for around $16,000-$18,000. Today, with poor resale value, these vans can be found for less than $5,000.


<i>Conclusion:</i> I do not like the Chevy Astro Van nor do I recommend it. The Astro handles like a much larger conversion van, gets poor fuel economy, and has quality control issues that should have been corrected by the 1992 model year. If you are looking for a van on the used car market I suggest looking elsewhere.
