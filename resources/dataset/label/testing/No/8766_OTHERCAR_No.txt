            Have you looked at the size of the tires on this car?  They are small!  So tiny, that while test driving the Echo I felt each bump in the road, each wind blast, and feared that each quick turn would by my last.  This is a car with untraditional styling yet built for traditional handling.

At first glance this car was to become my baby.  Why?  It's different both inside and out.  It offers a very roomy cabin which is especially helpful for us tall people (I'm 6'3").  Plus certain options included a 6 speaker CD stereo system.  I had heard of it's amazing height ability which allowed drivers to see more of the road and I'll give this small car credit, it offers just that.  But perhaps you are positioned so far up off the ground, in hopes you forget what's down below.  The Echo's tires are small, thin, which translate to poor handling and grip.  Don't expect to impress anyone with your turning ability.  Any other car will probably leave you in the dust.

The first thing you will notice about the Echo is it's styling.  The car is tall (height) and short (length).  The roofline allows the driver to see more of the road while providing plenty of room for tall individuals.  The car is short, which increases gas mileage and makes it easy to park.  The car comes in multiple colors and several features to increase safety and comfort.  

Besides the unusual styling, the other main selling point of the Echo is it's gas mileage.  It boasts that it will get up to 41 MPG.  I don't doubt these figures, but if you look closely you will notice how the car is able to achieve this ability.  

The Echo is light!  It's a feather weight!  

Don't get me wrong, in most normal driving conditions the Echo will handle just fine, and in those circumstances the extra gas mileage will feel like you received a deal.  But if you drive in an area or travel through an area with high winds, then be prepared to have your car pushed from one side to another.  It doesn't help that the tires are so small.  If you don't have the opportunity to test drive the Echo during high winds, I'd recommend you at least ask the salesperson.  If he says nothing but high praises, then something has got to be wrong.  

In the interior you will notice that the Echo offers basically the same as any other car.  Comfortable seats, good steering wheel response, and no speedometer.  What?  Ok, the Echo <b>does</b> offer a speedometer, but it's located to the right of the steering wheel, instead of in front of it.  Professional car reviews have claimed that after 20 minutes you get used to it, but since most of us go on test drives shorter than 20 minutes it's hard to get a good feeling from it.  I don't doubt those reviewers, but I find it hard buying something that I didn't like at first, no matter if there are promises to "get used to it".  

The absolute best thing the Echo has going for it, is the price.  This car is inexpensive!  The base model starts for under 10k.  You will have to go without a few options which come standard in most other cars...but the Echo offers a cheap car for those who want their cars exactly that...cheap.  

I ended up not buying the Echo, although I was really interested in this car.  Overall, the unsettling feeling of traction to the road was my main reason for passing it up.  I hate feeling out of control of my car, especially during high winds.  If your looking for an equally small car, yet with bigger tires, and better handling, then check out the Ford Focus.  The Focus handles better but it is more expensive.  

If budget is absolutely set to an inexpensive point, then the Echo will get you there and get you back.  But drive carefully.
