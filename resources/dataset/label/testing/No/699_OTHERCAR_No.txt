            I purchased this camera just before Christmas.  Initially the camera is complicated to master, with certain settings requiring you to hold down a button while turning a thumb wheel - and unless the features are used often, you will need to revisit the instruction manual often. 
Indoor photographs show a lot of Red eye, even with the red eye reduction on.  I had to correct the brightness and contrast on most indoor pictures using Photoshop. Battery life is short, my first set lasted only about 45 minutes while I tested some of the camera features. 
The camera refused to connect to my COM3 port on my computer.  It did connect to COM1 after numerous tries.  After much frustration, I purchased a 64MB memory card and USB card reader.  This is the only way to go, and greatly speeds up the download process. 
Overall not as pleased as I should be with a camera this expensive.     <br><br>
