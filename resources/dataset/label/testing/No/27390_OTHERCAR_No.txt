            My family rented this van for our road trip to South Dakota from out home in Seattle. And because we had it for a week and drove it about 4,000 miles i had a chance to really test this minivans limits and capabilities. When my sister first brought it home the night before we left i was impressed with the cool look of it. I instantly wanted to be seen in it, even though it was a minivan, it was in a league of its own.

Exterior: The front view is what i liked the best. The headlamps are large and shiny and look good. The 2002 models have daytime running lamps which offer good safety on the roads, especially on the interstates next to those big semis. The rear of the minivan has rounded tail lamps that have a crystal like look. They're pretty bright, but i think the center mounted stoplamp is crap and washes out under direct sunlight. The paint was good and shiny, the panels all fit right, the doors closed with a light thud. The rear liftgate is easy to operate too. Its hard to open the hood, but we really didnt have to since it was a new car. The front grille bears an aggressive dodge grille with the cool ram emblem. It helped beef the look up alot.

Interior and features: Ours came with s beige cloth interior with 2 rows of seats and two captain chairs for the driver and passenger. Airvents are well placed and the dashboard has white- faced gauges that glows green at night. The radio and HVAC controls are easy to use as well. The radio will stay until you open a door, this is because sometimes people wait in their cars even after they turn off the engine they want to listen to their music. The middle bench seats were hard and uncomfortable. The front and very rear seats were the best. The seatbelts adjust to your height as well. The dash materials are soft to the touch but very durable, and the overall control/design layout is neat and modern. The shifter is mounted on the steering column. The very rear vent windows operate with a switch which is cool. These among the many other features stood out the most.

Driving Impressions: Okay the Caravan had a 3.3 Liter V6 that was pretty good around town. But i think there is another engine that is stronger. The engine surged a lot when climbing long steep grades on the interstate. The tachometer reached into the orange zone and that scared me. The van was really full with all of our luggage too. Trying to control the accelerator under these conditions is hard, it gets touchy and doesn't listen to driver input very well. So i put it under cruise control, thought the computer might know how to handle the gas peddle better than i do in these conditions. It did the same thing, it kept surging up the grade, and when you disconnected the cruise control because a slow truck got in your way you lost all of your momentum and speed and took forever to get it back. Other than the touchy gas pedal the van really shined like a star with its good ride. When the interstate got curvy and the van going at 65 MPH the handling turned to mush. The Caravan felt sloppy and at one point almost dangerous. The seems too light and true road feel is hidden. Visibility is good too. 

    One more complaint are the headlamps. At low beams at night they didnt light up the road very well. And i kept getting flashed by drivers for having my high beams on when they werent on. And when you use the high beams they're too powerful and way too bright. But getting flashed by other drivers was really annoying and dangerous. Fuel economy was a high point. The turn signal sound is so silent you sometimes forget its still on and it confuses other drivers.

Overall the engine was really silent, when i first started it up i didnt know if it was on or not because it idled so silently. Transmission shifted silently and seamlessly.
