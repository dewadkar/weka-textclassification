            I own a 95 neon which I bought used. For being only five years old with mileage appropriate for its age it has way too many problems. I drive about five miles a day since my work and school are in the same small town. This car has not held up, the transmission is faulty,it eats the breaks, it has electrical problems, basically it drives like it is slowly dying. I have all the routine maintenance up to date and since I live in a small town I can't speed.
It is very noisy,the drivers seat will kill your back!. my sister bought a brand new 2000 and I drove it for a while, I didn't like it either it felt like a new used car.
I would not recommend it, buy a prizm, corolla or even a saturn, you'll be better off.<br><br>
