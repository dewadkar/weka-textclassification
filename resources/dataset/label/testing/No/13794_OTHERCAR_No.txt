            Oh, how I wanted to Zig! I had seen the commercials, promising that I would Zig in a Catera. It was enough to make me leave those foreign cars (Infiniti and Honda) and come back to Cadillac. The car is a looker, with sleek lines and a nice &quot;butt.&quot; And while it looks like Neiman's on the outside, it has K-Mart interior equipment. My armrest fell off. The back of the front seat fell off. The glass on the speedometer fogged up. Warning lights go on and off arbitrarily, and the driver will become alarmed unnecessarily. The inside is cramped for two, let alone four, and it's hard to see out of the back window. If you believe in American cars, and fall for commercials that promise you a &quot;different kind of Cadillac, one that zigs,&quot; then this is the car for you. It's a shame that this car can't compete with the comparable foreign made cars in its class. <br><br>
