            My 1996 Hyundai Elantra has already had a new transmission, 2 alternators, 2 front end alignments, numerous warranty repairs for fuses, heating/cooling problems, and much much more.  I really was excited to hear that Hyundai had a 10 year, 100,000 mile warranty.  I now know why they give such a long term warranty.  The car needs it to make it the 1 st 6 months.  The gas mileage is good.  The interior is very spacious.  The seats are very hard to move back and forth.  The dash board is not set up very nice.  The buttons for a lot of options are to small and you end up pressing something you don't want to.  The radio and speaker system are average.  Overall the car is not very reliable.
