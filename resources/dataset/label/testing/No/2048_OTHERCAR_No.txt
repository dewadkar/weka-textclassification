            I recently purchased a pre-owned Cadillac Seville STS and it is a great car, but the warranty that Cadillac puts on all it's pre-owned cars is horrible.  In the agreement I made, it said that every time I take my Cadillac in for service, I get a Cadillac rental car.  I have taken my Cadillac to the dealer about 3 times now, and have only received a rental car once!  The one time I did receive a rental car, it wasn't at the dealer that I bought it from, but another dealer.  When I took the car for service at the dealer that I purchased it from, I ended up walking down the street to the Enterprise Rental Car shop.  The Cadillac dealer said that you only get a rental car for service that takes over one day to complete, and that doesn't count the time that it sits on the lot while it is waiting to be worked on.  The dealer also promised me that the would have a garage door remote for me when I took it in for detailing, and they didn't have it.  The salespeople were also not very helpful with anything!  Even though the Cadillac dealer service is horrible, the car is wonderful.  The interior is roomy, the engine is great, and the styling is perfect.  The only bad thing is the WARRANTY.  When you pay that much for a car, you expect good service with it too.  <br><br>
