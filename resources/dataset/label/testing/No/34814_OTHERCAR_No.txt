            The Land Rover Discovery is a nice truck, but it is over priced.  A Jeep Grand Cherokee is much better and costs significantly less.
Don't get me wrong, Land Rovers are very good off road machines possessing a high level of technical sophistication, but so are Jeeps.  In fact this technical sophistication has resulted in some rather poor reliability records for Discoveries.
The Discovery has a nice interior with decent space and a nice ride.  The four wheel drive system is excellent and makes the Discovery and admirable off road performer.  However, the discovery is slow.  Even though it has a V8 it is slow.  The engine provides plenty of power for off roading, but not for normal acceleration.
I think that people buy the discovery because they think it is a status symbol and that's about it.  I haven't seen too many $30 K + SUVs off road any time recently.
The Discover has decent styling, but is too tall for my taste.
Buy the Discovery if you really like it, but go with a Grand Cherokee otherwise.<br><br>
