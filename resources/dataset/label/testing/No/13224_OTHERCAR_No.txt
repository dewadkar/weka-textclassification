            **NEW DATA**

DO NOT BUY THIS VAN!!!!
I am at 36,600 miles (conveniently 600 miles out of warranty I may add) and my transmission has completely failed!  This transmission has a defect that WILL EVENTUALLY cause a pin to become loose inside the bell housing and destroy the aluminum transmission case.  This renders the transmission totaled and CANNOT be rebuilt.  The only good things to come from this are: 1. after much b*t*hing at the dealer, they have contacted Daimler-Chrysler who has agreed to pick up the tab regardless of the out of warranty status.  2. I know to get rid of this vehicle as soon as possible.

This is an UNADDRESSED issue with 1995 - 2001 Daimler-Chrysler minivans.  The dealer admitted that this had been a problem, but nothing has been done about it and firthermore, the replacement transmission I get will inherently run the risk of the same catastrophic transmission failure!  I ask, do you want to take off on a 2,000 mile family vacation with those kind of odds.

In fact, this is such a problem that my new transmission has been BACKORDERED!  I told the dealer I was not surprised since the transmissions have a 36,000 mile MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure), that would explain the shortage.

Supplement 4/2002
Just more ammo:  Ever wonder WHY Chrysler is running all these ads about 7 year powertrain warranty?  If this isn't an admission of a severe powertrain problem I don't know what is!  Beware - if you want to keep the van for 7 years, you will still be changing transmissions to the tune of about $3k.  Be especially wary if you are the type who racks up more than average miles, the 7 years can shrink down to about 4 really fast.
