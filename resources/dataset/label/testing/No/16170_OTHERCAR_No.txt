            I purchased the Fuji MX2900 after considering the Olympus C2020, deciding on this device because of its manual mode and feature list.  As an endocrinologist I needed pictures of diabetic foot ulcers (color and depth) and individuals of abnormal stature, as well as &quot;before&quot; photos of patients.  after bidding at Egghead on this camera for about a week, I obtained the Fuji 2900 with a USP Smartcard reader and external flash for $577, including shipping. 
Among the attractive features are a 2&quot; display with brightness adjustment, a lithium battery which actually does produce 100 pictures following an overnight charge, and the USB reader, which acts like a hard drive even when hotplugged (something I do often), and image quality which produces perfectly adequate 1800x1200 images with very high color accuracy.  The highest .jpg setting gives images occupying 850-1000k of space.  The manual modes allow high sensitivity in fluorescent light or at night.  Unlike other reviewers, I found the internal flash adequate and have had little use for the external unit.
On the downside, the uncompressed .tiff images (4.26 meg each) must be converted to .bmp or other formats using the EZtouch software before Windows 2000 will show thumbnails in Windows Explorer.  
The auto shutter speed is rather slow, giving the equivalent of about 100 speed film... this is not a camera to be used for dynamic subjects.
The Effects mode (Sepia, Rainbow Cross, Silver Cross, and B/W) is a waste of ROM, serving only to produce mangled copies of processed images.
The Continuous-shooting mode (advertised as making up to 9 images in 3 seconds) requires 30-40 seconds of setup, often defeating its purpose.

In summary, this is a camera for cooperative, static subjects; color and detail are commensurate with Fuji film camera standards.  Low-illumination performance is also very good.  For what I spent, it's an excellent value as a portrait camera.

Sportsmen and casual photographers should look elsewhere.
