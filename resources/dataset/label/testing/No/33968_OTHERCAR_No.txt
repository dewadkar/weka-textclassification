            I bought my car with 97,000 miles on it. Its a good car, well built, powerful engine and good looks. Its very roomy and the engine response is excellent. But did run into a few problems. It has now 110,000 miles on it and the engine is still going strong. The transmission is messing a up add I need to get rid of it before it gets any worse. The CD changer doesn't work and neither do the 2 rear windows. If you happen to open the front windows after a rain or a wash, YOU WILL GET WET. The dash is well laid out and is very eye catching with a lot of style but without a glove compartment and a cup holder means -10 points. The door handles are coming lose and are cracking, both passenger and driver side. The trunk is pretty small as it is and most of it is hogged up by the CD changer and the amp.(CD changer doesn't work). That also explains lots of leg room in the front. I replaced my transmission mount. Other than the regular maintanence, I haven't had much done to the car, can't afford it. My muffler is broke and to replace that is another $400, out of my league. Its a beautiful ride especially on the long drives. Very comfy but goes all over the place when you hit a bump. (Its is a big car!) Handling is perfect, very responsive. A gas guzzler but for all that power I say 'burn baby burn'. The down side is of course, fixing this car, it tends to be very expensive, so I say look before you leap. For more on discrepencies I have please email me at qslinger@hotmail.com.
