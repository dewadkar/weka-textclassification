            I bought a 1998 Jeep Wrangler SE with a 4 cylinder engine in October of 1998. I had always wanted a Wrangler, but I could not afford to get the 6 cylinder. After getting the Jeep, I realized that this wasn't the best choice to make. 
While driving it on a windy day, this vehicle could barely go 55 mph. I will say that the wind was particularly strong that day but come on. I had the pedal all of the way to the floor and it would not speed up. I have taken it into the dealer and he said that there was nothing wrong with it.
I have also had many problems with it. There have been 3 times that the instrument panel has gone completely dead. When I turn the steering wheel to the right, it squeaks. When I accelerate or rev the engine, I hear a clicking sound. I have taken the Jeep in to get serviced for all of these problems, but they continue to come up. I also had A/C put in (after factory through the car dealership), an it makes a rattling noise when it is on. I asked if they would take a look at that too and they said they wouldn't because it was after factory installed. I realize that part of my problem is with the dealership, but these are problems that are occurring before the first 8000 miles. Don't get me wrong I love the Jeep, I just have many problems with it.
My other gripe is that it is so loud to drive you have to scream to talk. I like roughing it, but Jeep could make a tighter top, to make it less noisy. <br><br>
