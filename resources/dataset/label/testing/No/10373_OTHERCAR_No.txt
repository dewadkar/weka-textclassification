            Well like everyone else that I've been reading about. I was looking for reliable transportation with a decent price I could afford. Well the KIA Sephia is definately not it. I don't understand how they can continue to put unsafe cars like on the auto market. I have had my 98 Kia since Nov'98 and it has been to the shop over 12 times into the dealership with 15 repairs to be fixed over the past year and 9 months. Its a really bad, unreliable car. Im talking about from having the rotors replaced twice within a year. First time was barely a month after I got it. Also for cracked pads, starter relay,hazard lights and signal light malfunction,OD light,blow starter fuse, broken glove box, door seals replaced. Not to mention the two recalls for the fuel pump and windshield wipers. the radio was finally replaced after blowing the fuse twice, and an exhaust leak of the main silencer to my muffler and the check engine light always coming on, and the door handle replaced to wornt some more stuff. Now I am dealing with this car again breaking down. Now they say it had no oil in it and the engine is gone. Well for once to surprisingly  NO LIGHTS came on at all to give me any warning of this break down at all. At the time, I needed it too, they failed to come on. And all the dealership can say when I ask,&quot;Why didnt they come on this time to tell me something was wrong?&quot;. Well its past that point now, the cars motor is gone. They offer no support or help what so ever to help the customer. KIA Sephia are worthless pieces of junk. Even with the &quot;extended warranty&quot; that I have. It is not helping me at all. Its like they cant even honor it. You would think with all the repair history I have with that car. They would realize the car is junk. Yeah I could trade it in, but who wants it with the very low trade in value it has. And even to trade it in, you still have to put more money down on another car. When you have already put money down for a car thats total junk. The Lemon Law is not out to help anyone either just because of its long process. Overall, the KIA Sephia is a crappy car that I would not recommend to my worst enemy and it is very far from being a good, reliable car.<br><br>
