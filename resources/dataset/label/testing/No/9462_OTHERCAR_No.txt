            I just recently bought a Dodge 1500 series pickup because I like the styling, comfort etc.  This truck I am buying has a V-6 SMPI motor with 145 hp.  It idles rough, and has a severe out of balance condition between 1000-1500 RPM.  I took the truck to the dealer and they test drove it and confirmed that in fact (878 miles at the time) it does have a bad vibration.  They replaced the fan clutch which did not cure the problem.  I was informed that they needed to order parts ie torque converter, harmonic balancer, and I believe they even put a new crankshaft pulley on the list as well.  I took the vehicle back to the dealer and was without my truck for 2 more days as they replaced the parts.  This work did not cure the problem either.  I am then informed by the sales manager that they contacted STAR (tech assistance) and informed them of the problem.  They were aware of the problem but do not have a solution to it.  I went back to the dealer to get paperwork that was not given to me when I left, when I asked the service manager if they had found out anything on the problem.  I was told that that motor &quot;just does that&quot; and that it is fine.  I took it one step further and called the main Chrysler office and gave them the info as well.  They in turn called the dealership and then when they got back to me......said they have to take the word of the service manager concerning the problem and that was that.  I talked to the owner of the dealership, he called the service manager in and he said the same thing.  The owner said to take me out to the lot and try out some other ones.  We tested two others on the lot (the only two 1500s with V-6) and they in fact had the same problem.  I said &quot;Ok, lets try a couple of these Dakotas with the V-6&quot;.  He stated that the motors in the Dakotas are different and not the same but yet on the sticker on the window it states V-6 SMPI 145 HP just as it does on the 1500s.  Something is not jiving here and I believe they are stalling to avoid a &quot;lemon law&quot; situation.  For the information of people reading this....I have an extensive background in the mechanical field.  I spent 18 years in the US Navy as a diesel mechanic, and I now have been retired from the military for a year now.  I work at a large Western Star dealership as a heavy duty truck mechanic for a year.  In diesel or gasoline motors, an out of balance condition or vibration in time WILL cause the crankshaft to break in two at worst, or severely damage the internal components in effect rendering the motor useless.  Bottom line, you will not have a vehicle to drive PERIOD.  Better hope it occurs before the warranty is up and not after.......will be a costly affair to say the least.  In my opinion, the makers know of this problem but it was not detected till after they had already sent out and sold several thousand of this product.  The effect of BIG BUSINESS.  Let the customer find the problem and if they do blow it off as normal till the warranty is up, or blame them for the motor after the warranty is up on poor maintenance practices.  If you have a V-6 in a mid-sized pickup, or ANY motor for that matter that vibrates......IT IS NOT NORMAL and WILL cause costly damage.  I hope this will help anyone else out there before it is too late.  GET IT TO THE dealership as soon as possible, even if it has only ONE mile on it.<br><br>
