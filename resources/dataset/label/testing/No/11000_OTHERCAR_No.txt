              I purchased my 1997 Chevy Astro Van two years ago.  It was a pre-owned vehicle, with approximately 20,000 miles when we bought it. As of this date, we have 64,000 miles on it.  I have found the Astro Van to be very roomy, and comfortable on even the longest of trips.  It will easily carry seven passengers with four captain's chairs and one bench seat, which is important for a busy mom on the go!  The front seats feature lumbar support, and all captains chairs can be reclined.  The seats can be removed and rearranged as needed, and the rear storage is very spacious.  The interior also features various cubbies and storage compartments which are good for carrying essential items such a first aid kit, fire extinguisher etc. (Of course, my children think they are little toy boxes!)  One of my favorite things about the van is how high up I sit while driving.   I have a clear view of everything around me and feel this makes for a safer ride.
If I could change anything about the van, I would add another door.  The task of getting my young children in and out of the van with only three doors sometimes requires some contortionist-type movements and strain on the back.  Another rear door would make all the difference in the world.  I would also provide for more leg room for the front passenger side.  The wheel well takes up so much space that the front passenger has only a small area to place their feet.
On the downside, we have had to replace the transmission in the vehicle which was quite costly.  That is the only major repair the van has required.
This was my first van to own and know it won't be my last.  I'm spoiled on the extra space, and can't imagine traveling any other way.  I don't know that I will ever purchase an Astro Van again though, unless they begin making a model with four doors<br><br>
