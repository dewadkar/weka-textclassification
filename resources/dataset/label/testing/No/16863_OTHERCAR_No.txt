            I bought this product to have the ability to easily store my pictures on my computer.

The product is the easiest digital camera on the market to use.  The major advantage of this digital camera over the others is that the camera replaces the &quot;traditional&quot; film cartridge with a 3.5 inch floppy disk.  Most other digital cameras use FlashMemory (a.k.a. memory sticks).  Floppy disks are materially cheaper than the FlaskMemory (which can run you $300+).  With a 3.5 inch floppy I can usually store about 16 pictures.  The battery life is about 2 hours but considering that each time you take a picture is uses a fraction of a minute to take the picture, this is not really an issue to concern yourself with.

While I do not recommend dropping the camera, I do admit I have dropped it and it continues to operate fine.

One other benefit is that you will never have to go to the film developer again.  HP even makes a printer that allows you to print the pictures as glossy.<br><br>
