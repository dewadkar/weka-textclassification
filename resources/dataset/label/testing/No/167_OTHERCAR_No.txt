            I bought this camera last month in order to take both pictures of my newborn son an of products for an upcoming website.  I was informed by the sales staff of my local discount store that this camera included a zoom lens.  Therefore, this camera was supposedly worth more than the $59.99 models.  

When I got home and began using the camera, I found that the &quot;zoom lens&quot; was actually an optical zoom - in other words an enlarged area of the same picture at a lower resolution. 

Second, I've found that the optical viewfinder displays a smaller portion of the picture than is actually taken. This is a simple issue that should have been taken care of.

Third, I've found that the transfer rate from Camera to PC is exceptionally slow.  It takes upwards of one minute per 640x480 picture.  There has got to be something better at this price point.

Finally, I am told that this model is discontinued and Fuji will no longer support the camera.

...at least the pictures it does take are somewhat decent.

Good luck.
