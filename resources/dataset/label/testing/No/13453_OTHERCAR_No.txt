            Well, first the good things about my brother's Subaru Justy.  It got good mileage.  It was easy to park.  It made a good paperweight.  Now for the bad:  Cramped seating, unsteady ride, no power AT ALL (couldn't do hills), no control on slick/icy roads, leaked oil, no a/c or other creature comforts like good padding in the seats, odd-sized hard-to-find tires, no thermostat, and no power steering.  
He bought the car used in 1998.  First thing that went wrong was the entire exhaust system fell off from the engine back.  Next, the front left axle cracked, and then the right front wheel bearings loosened and rattled.  He had these problems fixed, and then 3 months later other ominous sounds and problems started to develop.  My brother decided to cut his losses and sold the car for $150.00.  I'm surprised that anyone wanted it.    <br><br>
