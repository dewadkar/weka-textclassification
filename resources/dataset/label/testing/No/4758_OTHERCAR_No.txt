            I thought I should share the experience I had with a 1998 Audi A4 1.8T about 5 months ago.  I was to take a road trip from Boston to New Jersey in my friend's Audi A4 1.8T.  Where do I start??  The car definitely does not have the value, nor the comfort.  The model I had driven was equipped with Quattro AWD and a tiptronic system (auto-stick).  I must confess, the only feature I really enjoyed was the tiptronic.  It is a 5-spd system where you can change gears at your command.  Otherwise it acts much like an automatic gear box.  It is good for when you want to do some hard driving, but Audi messed up with this one.  Linking the tiptronic with the 1.8T was a mistake.  First off the 1.8T produces 150 horses, which is minimal for a car this size and weight.  There is no noticeable torque power, and the pick up is just too slow.  Under full throttle the car is very unstable, and low end torque is non-existent.  This car is definitely not for the performance enthusiasts, take it from me.  If you really want an A4, despite its dated style which has been out for many years, you should opt for the 2.8 or even the S4.  The S4 is a quality performance machine that eats up BMW M3s.  I had a real problem with the interior design as well.  A car that sells for high 20s should atleast have a comfortable interior!  If you really want a dose of what I mean, take a seat in the back seat of any A4.  You will feel what I mean, literally.  And imagine taking a long distance trip in those seats.  The rear support is minimal, and the back rests are borderline 90 degrees to the seat.  However, I can't knock this car completely, because it does have alot of achievements.  The Quattro AWD gives you considerable grip and cornering capabilities.  It has been a really strong selling car, and the A4 is the car that actually landed Audi on the fame list for automobiles.  The styling is dated, yet still attractive.  Now there is an optional xenon light system that really gives it an sporty look.  I see the A4 as a fad that has almost reached its end.  There was a time between 1997-1999 when everyone wanted one of these audis.  Now I believe, people realize the value is just not there.  For example, you can get a fully equipped Acura TL for right around the same price.  The Acura TL is a much better car with much more power breaking 200 horses.  It also has a very comfortable interior, unlike the A4.  To those who own an A4, you should consider trading in for a new car.  And to those considering an A4, exercise the many choices you have.  Just in summary, the A4 is dated, and there are many new cars that have much more to offer.  <br><br>
