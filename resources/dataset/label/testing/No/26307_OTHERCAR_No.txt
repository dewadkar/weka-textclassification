            In the past few years, we've seen a shift of young people (who are stuck driving their Mom's Honda) attempting to modify their economy style cars into formula one race cars.  If you find yourself interested in a Civic for <i>that reason</i> then PLEASE do not buy it!

The Civic is a well minded gas miser that will get from point A to point B but NOT in the quickest time possible!  

<b>Buy This Car If:</b>
- You are happy going slow
- You like getting great gas mileage
- You want people to think you are frugal
- You value your hard earned money and just want a car that will transport you, not necessarily in style
- You like getting a good value for your dollar and don't absolutely have to have luxury when you drive

<b>Don't Buy This Car If:</b>
- You like to drive fast
- You like people to see you drive by and look twice
- You don't care about good gas mileage
- You are planning to make this car go really fast
- You want to be cool and make lawn mower type noise emanate from your engine

In summary, the Civic is an ok car for what it was designed for but it is not and NEVER will be a fast sports car.<br><br>
