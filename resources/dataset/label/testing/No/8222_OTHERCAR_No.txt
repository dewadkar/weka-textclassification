            When you think digital these days you usually think quality.  That's what the ad people want you to think at least.  I've been wanting a digital camera for a long time so, when I saw this camera for sale at Walgreen's really cheap, I ran up and picked one up.  

My excitement knew no bounds as I popped the batteries in and started taking pictures.  After loading the software on my PC I finally got to see my first digital pictures.  

They were, in a word, horrible.  

They were small which I expected seeing as the resolution was only 320x400 but what I didn't expect was the surprising lack of quality.  I took several indoor shots which I thought had adequate lighting as well as several outdoor shots.  The outdoor shots were too bright to see much of anything and the indoor shots were too dark.  Plus, my subjects were always blurry, some more than others.  This camera just didn't take good pictures.  I tried and tried but was only able to improve the quality a fraction.  I did manage to get a few shots with good lighting but overall this camera was a total disappointment. 

The good things is that it comes with everything you need.  You get the camera, serial cable to connect to your computer and software to download and manipulate the photos.  It also takes standard AA batteries but there's no adapter available so it must run off the batteries the whole time.
