            I bought this car thinking it would be a deal, because my friend owns one, and he said it has been great for him, well little did I know how absolutely terrible this car is, it breaks down every 20 miles, gets bad gas mileage, and it has this odor...It's awful, I can't turn on the heater, because the element has broken down,  the radio hardly works, I can only listen to KOZY 106.5, which is fine, but it gets really annoying, the steering wheel sticks, I have had to call my friends and family so many times to come pick me up from work so many times it's embarrassing.  And noone will buy it off of me because unlike me, they are smart and can spy a lemon.  I have even left the keys in the car in plain view in high hopes that someone would steal it, but they wouldn't even do that for me!!!  This is seriously the worst car I have EVER had!!
