            I have purchased 2 Ford Contours in the past 2 years.  My reasoning for buying a Contour was the price.  I felt I was getting a pretty nice, roomy, some what sporty car for the money.  I needed a family car but did'nt want a van or SUV.  With my first Contour I had very few problems besides the few recalls.  In August of 98 our Contour was in a accident!!  It had flipped hitting numerous trees before coming to a stop.  Yes i was very surprised to hear that a Contour could be flipped by being ran off the road.  But that still didnt bother us we decided to buy another Contour in Sept. 98.  From September to December of 99 we received 7 recalls.  We returned 3 times for the same recall.  We had NUMEROUS problems with our new car.  Yet we still had faith in our car. Until just last week......  Our car was in another accident, trying to avoid a deer our car swerved as we tried to regain control of the car it also flipped!!  In neither of our accidents did our air bags go off...  But yet they were both considered TOTALED.  I ask how can a semi-family car have been so easily turned over not once but twice.  <br><br>
