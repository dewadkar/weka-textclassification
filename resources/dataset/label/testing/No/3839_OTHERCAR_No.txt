            About three years ago I traded in my 93� Mazda Navaho in for a demo model 97� Montero Sport XLS.  Before I get into the details of this vehicle let m say the Mitsubishi is a 100% improvement over my Navaho (but that is another story for another time).  Little did I know that I was going to be insuring a corvette but getting a geo metro.

My MS Sport has it all 4wd, CD, moon roof, and power everything (well, everything except the engine).  And my friend therein lies problem numero uno!  The MS Sport is not powered or geared correctly for it�s   
Body.  When I accelerate the gearbox jumps from 4th or 3rd all the way up to a gut wrenching 1st.  In fact I though something was wrong with the truck and took it in for a servicing.  The dealer told me that that is the way they are geared and let me drive several others to prove the point.  OK so I know it�s not a racecar but wait!  My insurance bill came in and low and behold IT IS A RACECAR (or at least is insured like one).  As it turns out the MS Sport is so expensive to fix that it has a higher insurance symbol than a new corvette, Hmmm.  

This is the part where the good turned bad.   I don�t like paying high insurance rates, but ok it is what it is.  But now that I have had my SUV for a while I have replaced the brakes twice (every 30k miles).  The cupholder has broken and is no longer made in that style so I am unable to replace it, and let me say a bit about the body and paint.    

In a word the paint and body are THIN.  The paint chips with every piece of road junk that hits it.  Even the area around the door handles scratches from hand touching it to open the doors (why!).  I strongly recommend getting �bug� guard for the front end.  And while you�re at it spend the dollars and get a good brush guard I have the one made by WAAG.  Not that these will help you if you are in a collision, but it�s the little things that do tremendous damage.  I as in a parking lot and a runaway shopping cart did 600. Damage to my front end.  I watched in horror as the cart coasted into my front bumper and nicked the bumper, broke a head light and put a small dent in what I thought was the front left panel (as it turns out there are no panels it is a uni-body construction).  The uni-body construction drives repair cost through the moon roof.  Small dents cannot be fixed easily. 

Al in all I have to say; it is a love hate relationship.  I love the way the MS looks, I love the interior (although it is very noisy).  The MS sport has all the creature comforts that I expect, but the owner frustration factor makes me wish I had spent the extra $5,000. For the Toyota 4Runner Ltd. I was considering instead.  The MS Sport is a very average SUV in a market full of above average players.
