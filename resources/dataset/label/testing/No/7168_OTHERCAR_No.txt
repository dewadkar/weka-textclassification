            In the spring of 1999, a relative of mine purchased a new 1999 Dodge Caravan 15th Anniversary Edition. It was platinum in color and was fully loaded.

The Dodge Caravan has been one of the best selling vehicles in North America for the past 6 years. I feel this is because of its smart, family oriented features, carlike handling, and styling. Not because of its reliability.

The small 3.0 liter 6 cylinder engine is extremely under-powered. At highway speeds, the engine makes enough racket to start your own garage band. The suspension absorbs most bumps and ruts with ease. Handling is carlike, and squeezing into that little parking space at the mall shouldn't be any trouble for the Caravan. The headlights give inadequate illumination, and you find yourself squinting to see what is on the road in front of you (not particularly safe). The 4-speed automatic transmission upshifts roughly at high speeds, but is rather smooth during normal speeds.

Outside, the lines are graceful and sleek. It is one of the more attractive minivans on the market. However, trim components are cheap looking and poorly fitted.

Inside the Caravan, one word comes to mind. CHEAP. The dashboard components are made of...you guessed it...low quality, cost-cutting Chrysler plastic. All buttons and levers on the dashboard can break very easily. But, the dashboard is well laid out and you don't have to take your eyes off the road to fiddle with the buttons on the high quality stereo or the heater. The air conditioning cools the Caravan down in a very short time, thanks to the privacy/tinted windows. You could hide a lifetime supply of drinks in this van. It is cupholder heaven. Want to hide all your earthly possessions? Not a problem. Shove 'em in the Caravan. It has all kinds of large storage bins to hold everything from glasses to plane tickets to
clothes. The front seats are comfy. The rear and middle benches, however, are too hard and stiff, and are very uncomfortable on trips lasting more than half an hour. Legroom is below par. The rear storage compartment is spacious, however, and even includes some clips for your grocery bags, a thoughtful touch.

And now the bad news: According to Consumer Reports, the Caravan has had way below average reliability. It has also racked up a number of terrifying safety-related complaints, such as seatbelts that may strangle children, airbags deploying at vehicle start-up, and even stalling when within radar of airports and military bases. Radiator and air conditioning lines freeze or crack in cold weather, and motor mounts have been known to fail around the 25000 mile mark. Failures of the starter motor, brake pads, and fuel injector are all legion. 4-cylinder engines have a history of head gasket failure, whereas the V-6's have taken more of a shine towards oil leaks. The 3.3 liter V-6's head gasket rarely lasts more than 40,000 miles. The transmission in my relative's van cooked itself at the 40,000 mile mark, and all kinds of nagging electrical problems are present, like headlights blinking on and off, windows malfunctioning,  and engine surging. The Caravan seems to need the services of an exorcist rather than a mechanic.

If this isn't enough to keep you away from Caravan, then I don't know what is. Step away from this van at all costs, and look at the more sophisticated competition.
