            Just before my 18th birthday, I started looking for a new car to replace my aging 91 Mercury Topaz.  During my look I had only a couple of vehicles I wanted to avoid, a Honda Civic (because everyone had one at the time) and a Dodge Neon (all the reviews I read, and everyone I spoke to who had one complained about its numerous engine and transmission problems).  Because I wanted to support American car manufacturers I chose to look at the Stratus, mostly because I really liked the styling of the car.

After I signed the lease papers on a dark brown 97 Stratus, I was quickly ushered out the door, without the keys, because they had to &quot;prep&quot; the car.  I drove it home the next day.  I really liked the roominess of the interior and the sporty handling, but mechanical problems surfaced quickly.  Within a month I had a squealing alternator belt.  After three trips to the dealer, they finally head the problem that I had constantly called and written about.  Several months after, during the winter months I hear a loud moan/grind coming from the front end when I turned the wheel.  Four more trips to the dealer, and a complete replacement of the power steering hoses, (which now hang in plain view in front of the radiator) and the problem was supposedly fixed.  Even though this problem was still around I couldn't spare any more days off from work, nor miss any more days at college because I didn't have transportation.

The next six to eight months went by with the rattles from the front end becoming more pronounced and a series of recalls that brought me back to the dealer.  A little less than two years with this car, I went out of warranty because of mileage.  Then the real problems started.

I threw a connecting rod in my car that ended up punching a hole through the block and the oil pan.  Stranded, I called for a tow to a local mechanic.  After about five or six futile attempts to talk to a supervisor at customer service I finally got someone on the line who offered absolutely no financial assistance what so ever for my engine.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  I wrote a letter stating that I, (almost 20 at the time), would be purchasing quite a few cars throughout my life time, and that I had (regrettably) recommended Dodge to several of my friends.  I also stated that as a webmaster I would post my experiences with this car and the customer service department on line for the world to see.

Then, not to my surprise, I got a call from a customer service rep who offered a 50% reimbursement, essentially for my silence, provided I drop in a new Chrysler engine.  After a $4,000 engine repair bill (because of the all aluminum engine) my car was once again roadworthy.

Less than six months later, I found that I had transmission problems.  After a new fly wheel, a transmission and a $2000 bill, I was able to drive again.  Now just a few months ago, I found that I need a new front sway bar and struts all around.  This may be because of potholes, then again maybe not.  Who knows?

So here I am, just over three years with this car, 72,000 miles (which by the way forced me to buy the car at the end of the lease) and what will soon be around $8,000 in non-routine maintenance bills for a car whose sticker was $18,000.

I truly like the styling, roominess and performance of the car, but I don't like the customer service reps and the uncanny way this car has fallen apart once my warranty expired.  All in all, this car is mechanically no better than the dreaded Neon that my friends told me about.  Don't let the sporty styling and roomy interior fool you into purchasing this oversize Neon.  This car stays together just long enough for you to drive out of the dealer lot before things start failing.<br><br>
