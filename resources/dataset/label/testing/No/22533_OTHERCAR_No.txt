            This is no doubt an attractive and stylish vehicle but it's poor reliability cancels out the good in this car.  I bought one (new) in 94 and it barely made it back to the lot for trade in 98. 

I had a variety of problems with this car and in the first year after purchase, I had to take it in 16 times, all for different reasons.  The heat would not work, the air conditioning died, the brakes failed, it was recalled for steering wheel problems, and in the end, the transmission gave out entirely.  

The positive points were the look, the price, and the size.  Other than that, it is a purchase that I regret.

For a great winter vehicle, check out my review on the Ford Explorer!<br><br>
