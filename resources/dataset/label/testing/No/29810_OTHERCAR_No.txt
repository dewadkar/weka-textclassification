            I bought the Kodak DC260 camera about a 3 moths ago. I think this is a great camera. It takes great pictures, you can customize allot of options, and the resolution is amazing. But few weeks down the line I started having some problems with it. First off all, if you going to get this camera, you need few things. 

1) Make sure you get the rechargeable Ni+Mh batteries because over the counter batteries just will not do. The work, but only last like 20 pictures or few hours, but with rechargeable, I took over 100 pictures and they I could still play around with the camera for hours. 

2) Your computer HAS to be able to support USB. The camera works over Serial, USB, and Infrared. But anything besides USB is incredibly slow.

3) Sometimes you want to take like 7 pictures at the same time, but you canï¿½t. This camera has a burst feature, but it only takes 2 pictures at the time. Then you spend 30 seconds waiting until the camera saves everything to the flash card.

4) The last thing I want to mention is that the camera froze up on me couple of times. I had to take out the batteries and plug em back in to get it to work. It only happened twice, but it did happen.

My final review is, that unless you are a realtor, who needs extra high quality pictures, and is willing to sacrifice time, on waiting between pictures + paying a high price for the camera, get something else. I hear they made great improvements in the DC265 model in speed and performance.
