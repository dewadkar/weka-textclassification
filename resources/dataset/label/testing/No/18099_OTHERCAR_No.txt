            The price was right when I was car shopping for a newer model car when I bought my 96 Neon two years ago. Ever since I bought the car; I have had nothing but mechanical problems with it.  I can't tell you how many miles I have on the car because within a month of buying it; all my gauges died, yes all of them!! No speedometer, no temperature gauge, no oil gauge, and no odometer.  My left turn light blinks but only inside the car, and I don't have reverse lights even after replacing ALL the fuses and ALL the bulbs. The A/C was brand new in the car when I bought it; (the dealership replaced it as an incentive since that was one of the "must haves" when buying a new car) and it worked for all of two weeks and then quit. I have also had to replace the drive and crank shaft sensors. I have seen a few other Neons of the same year around town and talked to their owners and they have the same problems.  None of the mechanics we have been to seem to know what the problem is with the gauges and AC units.  Writing to the Chrysler/Dodge Corporation is pointless since they claim the car is too old to have anything fixed under warranty and recommend taking it to an authorized Dodge Dealer for repairs.  Been there, done that, got the broken car still.  The look of the car is sexy but the quality is not worth it.  I am a single mom and wanted a reliable low-maintenance car; what I ended up with is an unreliable car with high maintenance that I can't take more than 60 miles from my house since I have no idea how much gas I have at any given time.  :(
