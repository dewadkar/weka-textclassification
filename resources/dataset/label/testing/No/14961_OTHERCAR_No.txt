            After talking my employer into purchasing a digital camera to enhance presentations to clients, the next to do was decide which one to get. I chose the Mavica line because it takes photos on a regular floppy diskette. This meant that we wouldn't have to install drivers on all of the PCs in our small office just to download the photos, so anyone could use it. Also, we could use regular diskettes instead of those expensive flash memory cards to store photos on.

I bought the FD-73 for our office in the summer of 1999 because of the recommendations I'd read online. In some ways, the camera worked fine in the way digital cameras are supposed to, especially:

- You can instantly view photos you just shot to make sure you're documenting the scene as you'd like.

- You can easily import the photos into web pages, PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, etc.

Unfortunately, I think the quality of the photos the FD-73 takes is very poor. The workmanship of the camera itself -- great. The quality of the photos -- lousy. Especially for the $500 or so we paid at the time!

The camera doesn't perform well indoors where we used it most often. The picture is too grainy and the colors odd. The edges were poorer than the interior of the image. The best way to actually put these photos to good use is to shrink them down to hide the flaws of the picture itself and to crop out the edges.

I wouldn't recommend this camera for anyone expect for businesses where photo quality isn't so important. The only other compelling reason to purchase this model is if you *must* have the flexibility that comes with having a regular floppy diskette store the photos. 

If you're looking for a nice digital camera to snap family photos, look elsewhere. If you're a real estate agent, also invest in a better quality camera. In general, many other cameras offer much better value.
