            I have a '96 toyota tacoma. It is not a bad truck, but there are many other cars out there that I would prefer to own.  I have the basic plain jane model, and it is basic.
The only things I love about my truck are the color, and the stereo speakers.  It is not toyota's fault that I hate my truck so much. Yet if you are looking for a good car for a younger girl.  This would not be my choice of a car.  Being a girl in her early 20's I suggest a car.  My father talked me into purchasing this car. 
I have no room for anymore than me and one friend comfortably.  If I go on a trip, I have to put my luggage in the back of the truck and hope that it does not get wet.
If one of my friends children go with me, then my friends can't go because a car seat does not sit very comfortably in the middle seat.
I suggest if you are looking for a car with any room for people, and it must be a truck.  Definantly spend the extra money for an extra cab.
