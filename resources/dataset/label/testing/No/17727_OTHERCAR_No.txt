            We have owned a Saturn SL2 for the past 4 years and the automobile has over 100,000 miles. We purchased it used and it has been a good auto as far as under the hood repairs go however the interior of the car has major problems. First of all the leather interior was of poor quality and we have had to replace it with fabric covers, the plastic siding on the walls keeps lifting up, and the cup holder was cheap and broke very quickly. This is not a car for a family of more then two. The back seat is very cramped and uncomfortable. This would be a good inexpensive first car for a student.The engine has been reliable and the roll bar gives you a feeling of safety. Since the Saturn is not made of metal, it doesn't dent. In fact, I was hit and my right front was smashed pretty bad and by the next morning the body somewhat recovered on it's own. All in all it's an okay inexpensive vehicle. <br><br>
