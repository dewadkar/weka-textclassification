            I was looking for a digital camera to help get some pictures of stuff to sell on auction sites.  I figured at a resolution of 640x480 and a price tag of under $100 the Agfa ePhoto Smile would foot the bill.  I knew with a resolution of 640x480 I couldn't get resolution which was print worthy, but I didn't need that.  As soon as the box got to my house, I popped it out and got to testing it out.  With the flash some of the pictures actually turned out OK.  Without the flash the pictures were unidentifiable.  The problem is that when you use the flash on objects(like some thing you might want to sell on auction sites) you very often create a glare.  I packed up up, and shipped it back the the next day.<br><br>
