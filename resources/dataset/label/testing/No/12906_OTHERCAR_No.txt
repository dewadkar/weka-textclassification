            People use the word garbage in North America. People use the word rubbish in UK. People should use the word Volvo in Sweden. Volvo always associate their car is a very safe car. I bought the car new and it was the worst car I ever bought/driven. Within the 1st year I have the following safety problem:

1) ABS warning is on once a while, when it is on the ABS is gone
2) Without brake light without any warning even there is a light failure warning feature

Beside this the car failed to start after a short visit to mall. The dealer was able to restart the car but did not know why.

After the 1st year:

1) The car stall while make turns.
2) Hard to start the car after it stopped for a short period.

plus a lot of small electrical problems.

Volvo should not classified as Auto and it should belong to Garbage.

Only garbage collector should consider this rubbish<br><br>
