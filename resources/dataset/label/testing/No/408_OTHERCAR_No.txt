            i was out looking to buy a new car .. and there are a lot of choice out there. so i took a while and did some research on the new cars that are out there. 
so this was my choice. 
i bought the xterra but i bought the base model . at the time not knowing that they had a 4 cyl. u know it was a bad ideal. it revs to high and it has no horse power what so ever . the seats  are cheaply made and to me it was a bad choice . think twice and spend a little more money .
