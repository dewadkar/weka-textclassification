            A 1988 Lebaron Convertible was my first car. I bought it used in 1996 for $6,000 with only 48,000 miles on it.  I thought with such low miles the car would be a good first vehicle and college car.  

Then little by little things began going wrong.  First of all I noticed that the car had little or no pep during excelleration.  I took the car in the be serviced and for an engine treatment to clean out the gas lines and get ride of build up.  That didn't work.  Then the speedometer cable went out and I had to replace that.  Next the motor that puts the top up and down began to act like it could go at any time, and then one day it finally did and one of the only enjoyments left in this car (cruising around with the top down) was taken away. I also ended up replacing both motors for the windows.  The next problem that crept up was an electrical problem where the fan would not shut off after the engine was turned off and it would kill the battery day after day.  Then one day out of the blue the car started shaking when driving for extended periods of time on the highway.  I took it in to be analyzed for this problem, but they couldn't find anything wrong with it, and of course the car would only shake at certain times, and of course those times were never when a technician would be test driving it.  THe last straw was when I started losing the full turning radius of the wheels and was told that I would eventually have to replace the rack and pinion for the steering.  At that point I knew that this car was a money pitt. I had only owned the car for a year and a half.

The car was cute, but besides that it was a headache that just wouldn't go away.
