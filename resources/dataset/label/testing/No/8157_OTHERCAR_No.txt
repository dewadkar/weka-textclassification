                 I recently bought the Polaroid 300 digital camera.  I bought this camera refurbished for $99.00.  I had this camera overnighted and was thrilled when it arrived the next day.  This camera is easy to use, even for a novice like me.  My son even was taking pictures right after opening the package.

     I purchased this camera for business purposes. I sell antiques and collectables over the internet.  The pictures were easy to upload onto the computer.  For the price, I thought the pictures were of very good quality.

     I only had this camera for a week; then it broke.  I could not get the camera to turn on.  Luckily, this camera came with a year warranty.  Now my digital camera, is in the Bronx of New York City.  I do not know when I will get it back.

     I found myself at my mother's place of business, collectables in hand, using her $500.00 digital camera of two years.  The moral of the story?  You get what you pay for.  The price was nice, but it had to be fixed twice.<br><br>
