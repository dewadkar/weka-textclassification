            DO NOT BUY THIS CAR.

I bought my 1997 Chevrolet Malibu in January 1997.

My problems since then have included:

1. Control bushings on front wheels replaced - also squeaks in back but I haven't gotten that fixed yet
2. PCM (Programmable Control Module) replaced - stalled at a busy intersection during rush hour
3. Fuel pump replaced - had problems stalling
4. Passenger side windshield needed re-sealing due to whistling noise when driving on highway - sounded like a siren
5. Steering wheel replaced because buttons popped out - a nuisance
6. Stereo speaker covers replaced because they were warped - another nuisance
7. Battery replaced - This one was not bad.
8. Engine coolant leak in intake gasket fixed - very costly to repair.

Repair shop told me that brake pads need to be replaced and the rotors turned, but I haven't gotten it done yet.

I've religiously changed the oil and rotated the tires on this car, and I am a cautious driver...have not abused this car in any way.  However, it has not treated me very well in return.

Don't buy this car unless you love to visit the repair shop every month or so.
