            The Oldsmobile Intrigue has a nice look to it. But, we have had many little problems. The rear windows make an air whooshing sound whenever left opened while driving. We have been told this is a design problem &amp; there are no plans for redesign any time soon. The front automatic window never goes down with one touch as it should &amp; the door visibly &quot;puffs out&quot; when it is rolled down. The rear seatbelts had to be &quot;unlocked&quot; 4 times. They would zip back into their flat position after use &amp; never loosen to be used. As a result my 7 year old was without a seatbelt for weeks at a time until the part would come in or we could be fit into our dealers schedule to &quot;unlock&quot; them. And as of today's date 9/13, I would like to add, that the rear seatbelts are now officially &quot;recalled&quot; &amp; are being unlocked on any Intrigue that has this reocurring problem

The heater fan whistles continually when on low. And unless the mechanic working on it can hear it, it goes unfixed. And this has also been officially noted as troublesome by Intrigue owners &amp; has been &quot;recalled&quot; &amp; is now repaired. No thanks to all the mechanics that said &quot; I can't hear it, I can't fix it&quot;-jerks! 

The electronic odometer will occasionally blink off for an entire car trip. The dealer has said if it comes back on there is nothing that can be done.  

The car rolls forward after in park. And we've been told it is nothing out of the ordinary. It rolls like a car with a stick shift &amp; it's an automatic. So, these many little problems are annoying. 

Buy this car in another year or two when the &quot;bugs&quot; are worked out. We get compliments on the looks &amp; that is what drew us to it. It's too bad our complaints go unanswered because we really like this car. <br><br>
