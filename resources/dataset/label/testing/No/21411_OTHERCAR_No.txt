            Before I bought it, I loved this car. It's comfortable and cool and comes with virtually everything standard. The only options are moon roof, ABS and floor mats, every other conceivable thing comes standard. The body is very interesting, front half by BMW, back half by Saab. I like the 4 door hatchback. The car is very roomy inside and the standard leather and CD player are great. It also has good gas mileage (I generally average 30MPG). Of course, the warranty is the best out there (10/100k powertrain, 5/60 bumper to bumper).
Having said all the good things, let me tell you why you should never buy one:
Severe problems with the body include a tendency to dent VERY easily (a bird hit mine while it was parked and the door dented), the paint bubbles and chips and the clear coat cracks.
I purchased mine in September 2001 when they first came out, since that time, the car has been in the shop for the following:
October 2001 Windshield washer leaking all over hood.
October 2001 Exhaust gas recirculation valve leak.
November 2001 Paint chipping off hood and back bumper.
December 2001 Windshield washer leaking all over hood.
December 2001 Exhaust gas recirculation valve leak.
December 2001 Transmission axle speed sensor failure.
December 2001 Transmission wheel speed sensor failure.
January 2002 Transmission electrical system failure.
January 2002 Paint chipping off doors.
(I got a break in February finally)
March 2002 Door rubber seals falling off.
March 2002 Paint chipping again.
March 2002 Radiator fluid leak.
March 2002 Transmission failure again.

I would like to add that although the problems are numerous, I probably would STILL find myself able to recommend the car except that Hyundai's customer service is way below par. When I first reported the third transmission failure for the car, Hyundai's service center said "I can't help you, talk to the dealer." That is an exact quote, not an ad lib. The warranty is great but when it comes with service like that, I find it much less appealing.
