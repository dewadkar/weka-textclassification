            I bought my '95 NEON more for my girlfriend to drive and because it was cheap.  I mainly drive it to work and back and on long trips and when the roads are bad in lieu of my mustang because I consider the neon expendable.

It gets much better gas mileage than my mustang so I can't complain about that.  Though most of the time I can't get the damn gas tank completely full.  I think it's the way the fill pipe is designed.  It seems to &quot;foam&quot; up the gas and kick it back, shutting of the pump when you get around 3/4 full.  It usually ends up being a timely, painstaking task to get a full tank of gas.

This car is definately no cadillac when it comes to ride quality.  Though it does ride slightly better that my mustang, it definately does not handle like it.  NEVER corner hard with this vehicle.(Unless you LIKE the sound of the rim grinding into the pavement)

The only reason I use this car on long trips is because of gas mileage.  It's certainly not because of those rock hard seats and the back pains and leg cramps that result.  At nearly 6ft tall, I was surprised with the head room and just enough leg room.

I still don't understand the ride hide.  That thing bottoms out more than a lamborghini would driving through the woods.  And lets not forget about the windows fogging up all the time (cheap glass or something).  This causes you to have to run the defrost which runs off the air conditioner pump.  This causes an already very noisy engine compartment to become practically unbearable.

The NEON is definately built cheap.  But that's life, you do get what you pay for.  As for reliability, I've had it for a year and a half and other than the annoying creaks, rattles, and clunking that seem to be a caused by a broken engine mount, I haven't had any mechanical problems.

I would recommend this car for anyone with a cheap budget who wants a &quot;peppy&quot; car.  Young girls and starving college students seem to come to mind.  Or those like myself who already own a car that they cherish and would like to preserve it by not subjecting it to the daily driving punishment.<br><br>
