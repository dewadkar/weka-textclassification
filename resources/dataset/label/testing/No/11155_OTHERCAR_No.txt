                I suppose I'm what you might call a "big engine" boy.  I have always had six and eight cylinder cars.  My last daily driver was a 1997 Ford Explorer XLT with a V8, preceded by a 1988 Jeep Cherokee with a six.  Even now, my other "fun" car is a 1969 Buick Electra 225, complete with a full size big block 440 four barrel V8.  But all the talk of gasoline going to $2.00 or more for a gallon, and the Explorer getting a measly average 13-14 MPG convinced me it was time to move into something more economical.

    Before I decided on what vehicle I was going to purchase, I test drove the Honda CRV, the Subaru Forester and the Ford Escape.  I won't waste a lot of time on why I decided against any of these choices, but I must say the only reason I didn't get the Ford Escape is because of the four month wait for an ordered vehicle.  These cars are somewhat scarce and it took the dealer two weeks to obtain my car after getting a deposit; I took delivery the day my car arrived at the dealership.  Expect a difficult time in price negotiation since there are not many sitting on the lots for sale.  This could be even more of an issue as fuel prices continue to rise.

    My RAV4 is white with the "L" upgrade package and full-time 4WD.  The car has AC, intermittent wipers for both front and rear wipers, CD player with six speaker sound system, sun roof, privacy glass, electric windows and door locks, remote control rear view mirrors, cruise control, ABS, keyless entry, fog lights, and rear spoiler.  The sticker on the car was $25395 and the dealer gave me a $2165 discount on top of the trade-in value for the Explorer.

    The controls are easily located with most everything placed right on the steering column.  The cruise control is different than any other car I ever owned.  Instead of placing buttons on front of the steering wheel, Toyota has placed them on the steering column, similar to the light and wiper controls.  Functional but odd, I think.  The driver window has one touch for full up and full down control, a nice feature.  Heating and stereo controls are located in the middle of the dash and are easily accessed.  Night time illumination of the controls is adequate.

    The heating and cooling seems to be ample.  The engine is warmed enough within two minutes to get some heat from the vents.  The AC cools nicely on warm and hot days.  There is a recycle option to allow outside air to be closed off for extra heating or cooling.  The vents can be set to run out the dash, dash and feet, feet only, feet and windshield, and windshield only.   The AC can be turned on in any mode but automatically runs in windshield settings and cannot be turned off.

    The car handles very well and seems to hold the road fine.  I live in a mountainous area with plenty of windy, hilly roads.  The RAV4 handles the roads flawlessly.  Breaking is about the best I've ever had in any car and is close to that of a sports car.  The power steering is good and allows easy handling of the wheel, compared to some small cars that barely have enough power assist for the steering.  The headlamps are adequate and do a good job of lighting the roads at night.  The fog lights are less than impressive and seem to light the road too close to the nose of the car.

    Comfort wise, the inside feels slightly cramped.  I am only 5'11" and need to keep the front seat almost all the way back.  Even then my legs are still slightly cramped.  There is plenty of headroom and the driver's seat has an adjustment that lifts and lowers the back of the seat.  The seats are comfortable and recline all the way back in case you or the passenger want a snooze.  The back seats fold forward and are removable to increase cargo area in the rear.  There isn't much leg for rear passengers so you wouldn't put large folks in the back.  The ride is nice except on more than average road bumps.  Once the road gets bumpy you can expect to feel the car do some bouncing and feel it in the seats.  The stereo is barely acceptable, even with the upgraded six speaker system.  The CD player is easy to operate but is only a single disc unit.  I find the sound to be bass heavy and adjust the treble higher to compensate.  A third party system would be a nice thing for this car.

    Engine wise the RAV is about what you would expect for a four cylinder.  There is modest noise under most circumstances, but the engine does get a tad loud when pushed above 3,000 RPMs.  I average just under 27 MPG on the highway with speeds ranging from 55 to 70 MPH.  Mixed highway/town driving gives about 23 MPG.  Even with the improved four cylinder engine in the 2001 models, there is barely enough umph for hilly areas.  Flat areas and moderate inclines are no problem.  However, get yourself a steep hill and the engine -just- does the job.  I have some hills on my daily drive where the RAV4 has all it can do to maintain 40 MPH without shifting down hard and revving over 3000 RPM.

    All in all, this is a nice car.  It is best fit for areas that do not have steep inclines.  It is not necessarily the best choice for an area that lots of hills.  It is not for large body folks, folks with long legs, and people that have large passengers or need to do car pooling.

    I will update this post once Winter hits and I have a chance to test the full-time 4WD.
