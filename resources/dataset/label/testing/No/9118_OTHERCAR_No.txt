            I'm probably going to end up echoing several other people's opinion of this car, but maybe I can bring a somewhat fresh perspective.

This car replaced an '86 Acura that I just loved, but my partner had difficulty fitting into. That made it pretty difficult and problematic to go on the long driving trips we both love. So, when it was time to replace the &quot;gas geezer&quot;, the short list was just that: very short, as it had to include only models that my partner could comfortably fit. After doing some basic research and test drives, the only one that really fit the bill was the Aurora --- and I have to confess, the racy styling had turned my head more than once, and I was hoping it would have the same effect on others (it does!).

I have to say that the interior design is an ergonomic marvel, but only for the driver. Aurora's early ads featured a photo of the &quot;cockpit&quot; (and it really **IS** very much like a cockpit!) with the simple tag line: &quot;...and you'll find there's probably a button for that, too!&quot; It didn't matter what it was you wanted, there's a control for it. For example:

     * The Information Center measures elapsed time, distance to destination, time to destination, shows the date, monitors the engine condition, on and on and on, and does it all in either English or Metric.
     * The heating/AC can be individually set for the driver and passenger sides. If my partner is a bit warmer or colder than I am, well, we just make the passenger side a bit warmer or cooler than my side. It's also set to a specific temperature, rather than the more traditional &quot;hot/warm/cool/cold&quot; choices. The fan speed and cabin temp are set automatically, and the fan will not engage until there is enough engine warmth to circulate warm air rather than simply blowing cold air and waiting for it to warm up. The controls are large, easily read, and easily learned (as a usability professional, that's a big one for me).
     * Everything is literally at your fingertips. You never have to reach or search for anything, because of the &quot;cockpit&quot; design that slightly wraps around the driver. On the other hand, this can make the passenger side seem somewhat claustrophobic: the passenger must keep his/her legs extended; there's really not much room for &quot;sprawl&quot;.

So, I love the interior design, but the execution has been disappointing. From the beginning, the car was plagued with squeaks and rattles that just shouldn't be there in a $35,000 car! Part of the &quot;cockpit&quot; console has a good 1/2&quot; gap between sections --- even though the corners are rounded and padded, this should be narrow enough that a cigarette paper can barely fit! When all is said and done, the fit and finish are still typical of GM: nice design that's pretty sloppily put together.

The engine shows surprisingly sluggish acceleration for a V-8. The response is not at all what you'd expect: there's a bit of hesitation, then you're suddenly pinned to the seat by the G-forces. (And, of course, you discover you've just used 1/4 tank of very expensive gasoline!) The mileage is not as bad as I expected, and not as bad as some others seem to get, which surprises me as I routinely drive a long commuter (45 miles each way) over extremely mountainous road.

I have been extremely disappointed in this car's paint job, which is beginning to flake badly. Now granted, I do live on the California coast, which means lots of fog and salt air, but the car is garaged every night and shouldn't be peeling this badly after only 4 years.

Note that Olds has substantially changed the Aurora's design for the 2001 models, so that the car (and the entire line) once again really **IS** &quot;your father's Oldsmobile.&quot; I was part of a focus group that evaluated proposed redesigns for Aurora, and I am really disappointed to see that all of the worst, and most boring, design ideas seem to have been incorporated into the latest models.

Bottom line: I'm not sorry I bought this one, but I wouldn't buy another one.<br><br>
