            First, let me start off by saying the the Camera is not horrible but not worth its value either..

PICTURE - The picture quality of the DC4800 is not nearly up to the standards of other 3 megapixel cameras of even less price! I was disappointed with the printable results at even sizes like 5 by 8. At 8 by 10 the picture become pixelated. While that camera's photographs look excellent on the computer, when printed the result is disappointing. I even have a professional photograph printer and the photos are just so so . 

LCD FUNCTION/MENU - The interface of this camera is wonderful. I really like the speed in which you can access basic function. however, the display itself is not up to par and displayed images appear lined and pixelated.

SPEED - the camera is by far one of the slowest cameras that i have ever used. It takes seemingly forever to initilize. 

PROBLEMS - the LCD of this camera is encased by a metal framing. This framing on my camera began to crack very early on. The cracks encompasses the entire display. Let me make my self VERY clear that i am excessively protective of my equipment and have never dropped, impacted, or forced this camera in any way and the cracks continue. I did some research and hundreds of other have had the same cracking. Sadly, Kodak just IGNORES the problem and accuses the consumers of misuse. Lets think about this folks... Hundreds of people have the same issue at the same place hummm... must be an act of God not covered by the company.

CONCLUSION - Please do not waste you money !
