            In October of 1996, my wife and I leased a 1997 Galant LS.  We decided to go with the Galant because of a good previous experience with Mitsubishi, and the salesman that we dealt with was a friend of the family.  We wanted the car loaded, and it was....every option available was in the car except the V6 engine.  The sticker price of the car topped 25,000.00....we were shocked......however we were able to negotiate what we felt to be a reasonable lease payment.  

The car was great.....for a short time.....My wife drives this car to work, which is 90% highway miles, yet after only about 15,000 miles, the engine ran like it had logged 200,000 miles on it.  I idled very rough, and was noisy.  The engine was looked at, but we were told that it was &quot;normal&quot;.  

Speaking of the engine, the 140 horsepower four cylinder sounds like it's going to bust through the firewall anytime it goes over 3000 rpms.  The only good thing that I can say about the engine is that it has descent torque for a four cylinder.  The &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; transmission had good upshifts, but would downshift very hard anytime you'd go down a hill or apply the brakes....this is something that is hard to get used to.

Other problems that we experienced were faulty door locks.  (they locked on their own at any given time) and also some other minor engine problems.  

The interior of the car was nice, good styling and descent comfort.  One complaint that I have is the front passenger seat should also be power for that price.  One thing very positive was the Infinity sound system.  This is definitely the most fantastic factory audio system that I have ever heard.  

The handling of the car was descent, but the ride was a little rough.  Wind noise in the cabin was very evident.  

The lease on this car is finally nearing it's end....and we couldn't be happier.  We've already purchased a new car, and are glad to be turning in the Mitsubishi soon.   For the sticker price of that car, a V6 should have been standard, and also, the build quality and reliability couldn't match up with it's competitors from Honda and Toyota.

If you are set on a Galant, I would recommend a newer model.  The redesign seems to have produced a much more solid and stylish car at a much more reasonable price.
