            I recently purchased this digital camera and was terribly disappointed.
After sorting through several manuals, I found the english version, and read all the instructions on using the camera before attempting to use it.

After all that, I still found it difficult to use.  I had to sort through menus of options that had very undescriptive symbols for functions that I needed to use.  I couldn't even get the panoramic feature to work, because the instruction booklet was really vague on this feature and how to work it.

As far as picture quality is concerned, I could only find two zoom settings, and it seemed that the second setting is the only one that would produce a clear photo.  Images at a distance of about 8-10 feet away (no matter what the lighting) came out unclear or not too sharp.  

As far as short lifespan, the camera takes 4 double A batteries.  These batteries last maybe an hour of picture taking. Some brands last less than that.  The camera does come with a battery charger, but if you are needing to take pictures for about 3 hours, forget it.  Get ready for a major inconvenience.  Many of the menus and options that you have to sort through for some functions are displayed on the lcd screen.  The lcd screen uses battery power very fast...so you waste most of your time trying to get the camera to cooperate, rather than taking photos.  

Personally, I returned my camera after giving it a fair chance.  I don't think $300 dollars was worth it for this camera. I would rather spend a little more money and buy a digital camcorder which has a better more long lasting battery pack.  You can still take still images, but you can also take full motion takes and pick out images from different scenes.  

I valued this camera at about $150 dollars.  I probably would have kept it if it was less expensive.
