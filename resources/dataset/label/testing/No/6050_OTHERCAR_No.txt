                RCA CDS1000 Digital Camera

   If your looking for a tag along camera thats helpful, average pictures and good looking then this may be the camera for you. In my opinion it sort of collects dust until I get it ready for trips. You can hook it up to your computer, stash your pictures wherever you want. It has about a 1 inch square LCD screen but, it doesnt show your pics it tells you how much room you have left and how much battery life and the basic stuff like that. You can also turn the flash on or off to fit your needs. The RCA CDS1000 is easy but difficult read further and i will tell you about the useful but weird to use portable camera.

      HOOKING-UP TO CAMERA OR T.V.

   Hooking up to your mac is very very difficult and confusing. I have never tried it on a Windows, and i doubt it will be any easier.
When you hook up your camera to the Mac, if you have MAC OS 10 on an suppose to be OS 9 computer (if you know what I mean) you have to go back to OS 9 and transfer the pics to OS 9.
   To simply view pictures just get your TV adapter cord and plug right into your TV, then simply press two or three buttons then you can view your pics one-by-one. You can also delete the pics on your camera-to-TV, you can delete the whole package of pictures or just one.

     OVERVIEW

   The over all camera is easy, fun, portable and compact. The pictures arent crystal clear but pretty good just for viewing or for making a special gift or something. Its doesnt have too much buttons but the battery life is awefully low and it drains even when not on (atleast thats what it seems like) so yes try it out and see how you like it although I wouldnt buy it again if it broke. And YES its very easy for a beginner from kids 8-18 or older.

      GOOD LUCK making a choice!
