            I bought a '90 Mitsubishi Mighty Max as my first truck.  That thing was nothing but a nightmare.  

First, it always had this persistent squeaking belt.  No one could do a thing to stop it.  It seemed to stretch out new belts until they became loose, and the adjusting bolt couldn't be tightened any more to prevent it.

The belt squeaking, however, was very minor.  The biggest problem was the engine.  The original engine threw a piston within a year.  I figured that it was to be expected considering the age.  So, I took it to our family's mechanic.  He said he had TWO other Mitsubishi Mighty Max's waiting for new engines, and it was a typical problem.  He recommended that I just cut my losses and buy a new car, but I couldn't really afford anything new.  So, I told him to go ahead and put in a new engine.

Within three months after I got the new engine, I was driving along when suddenly my engine caught on fire.  My entire truck burned down.

***In case anyone is wondering, YES I kept it well maintained.  I've been servicing vehicles since I was 14.

Fortunately, my insurance company gave me a good settlement and I was able to buy a really GREAT car; a '94 Chevy Cavalier.  If you want to know about that car, check out my epinion on it =).<br><br>
