            Interior

One would expect an auto in this price range to provide less than the best interior accommodations.  The Malibu does not disappoint here.  The copious plastic is cheap looking and in many cases, ill fitting.  However, the seats are quite acceptable and two could take long trips in relative comfort.  The back is a bit tight but there are a number of family sedans that are worse.

Exterior

The paint is very well done.  After almost four years it still has a new car sheen notwithstanding the fact that I haven't waxed it as often as I should.  Gaps between the fenders and hood, door and trunk are relatively tight and consistent.  Doors have a solid feel, opening and closing.

Driving Impressions

The auto handles fairly well.  The stock tires are substantial enough for hard cornering, acceleration from the V6 is good, and breaking is adequate.  Would have been nice to get disk breaks in rear.

Reliability

The worst car I've owned with respect to reliability.  At about 24,000, the front air damn (just beneath the radiator) fell off.  After 32,000 my air conditioner controller went bad, but was covered under warranty.  Right after my warranty expired, the alternator failed.  One month later, the water pump bit the dust.  Fortunately, I purchased the extended warranty....I would imagine the repair on those last two items exceeded $1K.

Sound System

CD sound is horrible.  The sound is far too bright to the point that I play my CDs with the treble turned almost all the way down, and the fader set to direct the sound to the back speakers.  No excuse for something this bad.

Conclusion

This is the first car I'm trading in before the end of my 60 month loan.  The problems far outweigh the car's assets.
