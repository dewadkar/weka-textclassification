            I wanted to write this so no one else makes the same mistakes I did!

I've owned this car for four years now and am (finally) selling it.  

History
Nine (9) days after purchasing the car - the clutch needed to be replaced.  Luckily the dealer covered this.

Two (2) months after purchasing the car - the head gasket needed to be replaced. ($850)

Over the next year replaced: brake pads ($80), shoes ($80), drums ($240), routers (?), water pump ($150), radiator fan ($150), timing chain ($250).  That's all I can remember off the top of my head.

In the last four months (Kilometer's driven in four months - 1600):
Struts and mounts ($550), Forget the name of part but runs the day lights in the car ($175), Fuel injector system & lines ($650) and still needs a Derm module estimated by the dealer "we'll put a new one in for $600   labor {$80/hr) and hopefully that will fix the problem".

(All prices in Canadian dollars)


Also, I've had six recalls preformed on this car!

Positives
To be fair there are a few good things about this car like the body, it is in good shape and I haven't had any problems with rusting or holes.  It's also really good on gas I can get about 600 km per tank of gas!  And it is comfortable for long trips for everyone because it has a huge backseat and huge bucket seats.

Handling
The car handles ok, it's a standard and you have to be going about 20km/h in reverse (which can be quite dangerous) or else it's a real shaky. The rest of the gears aren't all that smooth, the gears tend to stick but it's tolerable.

Features
There are no features in this car, it came with an am/fm radio and the seats are adjustable.  The trunk hasn't worked in three years and it didn't come with a tire iron, spare tire, or tilt stearing (all standard on this car).

All in all, I'm finally getting rid of it and I just don't want someone else to go through what I've gone through with this car.
