                 I have owned a Grand Am SE 96 for two years now and, although nothing major has broke yet...I can see it coming.  I know many people who own or did own Grand Am's in general who lost plenty of money with these bad boys in the shop.

     I currently have 48,000 miles on my vehicle and the following are problems I've had with it:

-Rattles, rattles, rattles...
-Tape deck SKIPS despite cleaning
-Driver Side Electronic Lock button fell INTO the door!
-For some reason it goes out of alignment within a few days of taking it  
 in to get done!
-Shocks squeak every time I hit a bump

     Now, that isn't really too bad but I hope that nothing major happens until I get at least 100,000 miles into it, like a NORMAL car should!  However, all of the stories I've heard feature Grand Am's breaking down far before the odometer hits that mark....

     On the plus side, its attractive looking, the transmission shifts decently, theres alot of power in it for a 4 cylinder, and the handling is decent.

     UPDATE 4/16/01
     Ok, I just hit the 65,000 mile marker.  The car has now been in the shop 3 times in the past year!  The first time it went to the shop was because of a busted alternator, I got the battery replaced as well.  The second time it went to the shop was because of a mysteriously shredded fan belt for reasons the mechanics couldn't come up with.  The third time was because I rear-ended someone after my brakes nearly failed!  I am getting more dissapointed with this vehicle by the month!   
     By the way, I'm starting to see even MORE rattles....
