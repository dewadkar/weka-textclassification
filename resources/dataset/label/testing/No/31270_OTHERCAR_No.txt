            We bought this car for about $3200 in October of 2001.  It had about 108,000 miles on it. It was (still is) a nice looking car...the only problem we had with the exterior was that the back bumper faded a lot.  As for the rest of the car...it just seems to break a lot. We have changed the oil every 3,000 miles since we've owned it, but we still have had a lot of problems with it. First, it was leaking coolant...took it to the shop and they replaced the surge tank cap ($25). Then we had it in the shop for brakes.  Then we had another coolant leak...took it to the shop again, this time it was the heater core($250).  Three weeks later we took it back to the shop with yet another coolant leak. This time it was the water pump. ($240).  Drove it maybe 15 feet down the road, and heard a loud thump and the car would not move. And now we need a new transmission. It gave out with absolutely no warning at all.  We have only owned the car for 6 months, and have not driven it that much.  We will be shopping for a new car now, and it certainly won't be another of these. (we had a 90 grand am before this one, with many of the same problems, both were the quad four engines).  Beware, when these cars break, it is difficult finding anyone willing to work on it, and while the parts are fairly cheap, the labor cost is outrageous since they are so hard to work on.
