            i have a 95 toyota 4 runner Sr 5..2 wheel drive.I bought this car because of its great looks and the dependability Toyotas are known for.i had finally HAD IT with american cars.My ex husband had a 82 toyota pick up and all he  had to do were brakes and oil changes.I went ahead and plopped 8 grand down on a 20,000 dollar 4-runner.It was great..for a year.the ride is so smooth..like a cadillac.Sitting so high..it also seems to do a lot for your self esteem.Hey..i thought..the 360 dollar a month car payments are worth this baby.
After the first year,tho..little things are starting to go.First it was the battery..ok..no biggie i thought..til the battery made the fancy dancy radio lock up and unable to work.Then i find out the only way to get the radio up again is by going to the dealer..65 bucks!It;s all these little things..the strips of rubber on the outside are starting to peel off,the front brakes seem to be going,there seems to be a little wobbling in the  front end when i get on the freeway.maybe the newer model of 4 runner is better...but I can recall having older cars ..like a 72 mercury montego that i bought in 1981,for 800 bucks..being much more reliable and holding out better than this thing.If you have 20 k laying around to spare i'd say go for it,but somehow i get the feeling there are better cars out there for 20K that dont start losing their rubber stripping at 70,000 miles.
especially when toyota was so confident to give this car a 10oK mile warranty.<br><br>
