            I have owned 2 of these cameras: the first one my then-13-month-old dropped and broke (toddler abuse not covered under warranty). Since I had been generally happy with the camera, I replaced it with the same model. MISTAKE--at least for me.

My biggest complaint about this camera is an important one: the quality of pictures just doesn't stack up to that of pictures taken by friends with other, often older cameras. Specifically, I find it impossible to take a good indoor picture of much of anything ... toddler, remodeling work, parties, etc. When I use the flash on the Auto setting, it overfills the subject and I wind up with a terrible shadow behind it. The fill-in flash makes everything orange (I've become quite the color corrector using Photoshop). And if I just want to use the ambient light, say in front of a south-facing window in the middle of the afternoon when the light is delightfully pooling on the floor,my subject must stand stock-still because the shutter speed slows down and the picture is blurry. Until my daughter is about 25, that's not going to happen.

What's more, the flash distance is NOT good. I recently tried to take photos at a friend's wedding reception and although I was only 8 feet away from her, the flash didn't carry and the pictures were too dark.

Another annoyance is that if the room is dark, there is no way (at least I haven't figured it out) to adjust the screen lighting so you can frame your subject. In addition, when the room is dark enough that you should use the flash, the autofocus feature won't lock on and the pictures are blurry. I've used my mother's Sony, and it has none of these problems. I've also seen pictures from friends using much less expensive 1-megapixel cameras that take better pictures.

Other complaints: Battery hog during picture download; slower-than-average shutter speed; clumsy menu design and operation.

I am an experienced photographer using film, and this is my first digital camera purchase. I usually shoot about 250 pictures a month, and with this "replacement" camera I'm lucky if I get 10 usable shots, and by usable I mean in focus and correctly lit.

I'm tired of having to spend hours correcting photos, especially since I bought this camera so I could have more "instant" access to my photos. As soon as I can afford to do so, I'm getting something else!

There are better cameras out there. Buy one of them!
