            This camera will not function for more than a few minutes using any sort of AA batteries other than nicad or ni-mh.  Even with those, battery life appears to be very short.

The Clik disk got stuck in the camera.  Agfa offered no solution.  Their technical support system is ludicrously cumbersome and slow.  They never answer their phones, so support is through web-based messages.  After I threatened to sue them, they agreed to replace the camera.  I provided my receipt and received email saying it was being shipped and would arrive within 10-14 business days.  30 business days later I called them to find that in fact they never shipped it and had no schedule for doing so, BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY DO NOT HAVE THEIR OWN CAMERA IN STOCK!  How convenient.  And ludicrous.  

I believe that Agfa's practices are fraudulent and are certainly abusive toward the customer.  They apparently believe that their customers are idiots who would believe that the manufacturer of a camera that is still on the market does not have any of its own camera to provide as replacements for defective ones.  When customer support finally called me back and I spoke to a supervisor, she was arrogantly rude.

I would never buy another Agfa product, because they did not stand behind the CL30 in any way.<br><br>
