            I got this car from www.cars.com for just $9K used with 20K miles on it.  My mom saw another one just like it at a car lot and encouraged me to get it, so at 8 months pregnant, needing a second safer car, I got it.

PROS:

I love the old-fashioned wood-like dash.  The controls are accessible and easy to operate without searching for them, and the buttons on the steering wheel for cruise control are great.

I also love LOVE the trunk space -- I packed half an apartment in there, and usually can carry around my sons bike, stroller, beach gear, and a present or two, plus groceries.

I like the overhead room in the front seats and the dual airbags.

This car handles well around turns since it has a wide/low base.  I've only had one or two wild turns in the rain and snow.  

This car is also very solid (heavy).  Would do well in a crash.

CONS:

You do get what you pay for.  This car is a gas guzzler.  I have easily spent $20 - $30 per week filling it up, and no sooner then an hour or two into a long drive, it's back to half a tank.  I could have gotten a sports truck for that!

The 4 cylinder engine assures longer starts and slow acceleration.  I get honked at quite a bit when merging, because the car doesn't speed up enough.

The sound system in the rear is not all that great--kinda muffled, though okay up front.

I've experience on recall--a warping dashboard, which didn't become a problem to me before it was fixed.

There could be more leg room in the rear.  I thought it was roomier when test driving it, but I apparently should have taken more time to examine everything.

I'm not a big fan of the heating system.  It would be great if there were rear air vents.
