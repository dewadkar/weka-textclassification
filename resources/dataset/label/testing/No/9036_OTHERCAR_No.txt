            I purchased my 2000 Kia Sportage 4X4 EX model brand new and have owned it know for 14 months. I fell in love with it as soon as I took it for a test drive. It's everything I wanted. Power windows, cruise control, 4X4, nice looking, reasonable price, excellent warranty and it was comfortable. It was like we were made for each other. I truly was in love with it!

Fourteen months later..... I WANT A DIVORCE! YOUR NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS! PLEASE GET OUT OF MY LIFE!

I have taken it to the dealership (20 miles away) 4 times for the same problems. 

Very noisy compressor, squealing and whining at me constantly, gets even worse with the AC on.

Loud noise, like a chirping or squeak coming from underneath by the catalytic converter every little bump I drive over. It even makes that same irritating noise when I get out and shut the door.

I have to SLAM the rear hatch in order for it to latch closed all the way.

The cruise control doesn't work.

The rear power windows don't work.

I have had it back to the dealership 4 times in the past 14 months and every time I pick it up, It seems to be fixed.  A week goes by and all those irritating noises and problems come back to haunt me. I don't know what the tech at the dealership does for the quick fix, but that's the problem, it's a quick/temporary fix.

I am considering getting rid of it, even though the resale value is terrible. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND A KIA, nor WILL I EVER BUY ANOTHER ONE.
