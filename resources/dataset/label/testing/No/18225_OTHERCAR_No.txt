            I have had my GSR for just over a year and have loved every minute of it.
I have driven in Montana in the dead of winter with no problems. The
shifting is very smooth and if you like speed then you have to try
driving a GSR when the VTEC kicks in! The integra is also a 
fairly practical car. It gets good gas mileage (although using high
octane gas in the GSR tends to counteract the savings). The back seat
is really meant for people to sit in unlike some other coupes. The back
seat also folds forward to accommodate large items in the trunk (I have
moved bookshelves in mine). After having a bad experience with a GM car
I hate to list my petty complaints, but here goes... Some of the knobs 
for the air conditioning etc. don't seem that sturdy. I have had one
rattle in the passenger door that I fixed by tightening the screw. The 
paint seems to chip more than with previous cars I have owned. All in
all I would have to recommend that if you are looking for a small coupe
and can afford it then buy it. If not then don't test drive it because
nothing else can compare.<br><br>
