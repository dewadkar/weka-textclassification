            I purchased this camera shortly after they came out.  I had read reviews in the various magazines and was intrigued by the concept.  I had a coupon at a web store and got it at a minimal price.

The camera is very small and easily fits into a shirt pocket.  It uses one AAA battery and the battery life seems to be very good.  It has a view finder, but no LCD to view the photos taken, probably due to the small size of the camera.  That is not a problem - you sacrifice this for the small size.  The package included a mounting device so you can use the camera as a webcam.  (I have not tried this).

The photos can be transferred to your PC using a special USB cable that is included in the package.  This is a very easy process.  I use a photo editor to 'acquire' the images from the camera to the PC.

Big disappointment in picture quality.  The specs say it takes photos at 640X480 resolution, but the quality is very, very poor.  The center of each photo is OK, but the outer one-quarter on the top, bottom, and sides is out of focus.  At first, I thought it was because I wasn't holding the camera still, but the out-of-focus areas still appeared even when bracing the camera against something solid.  There is no flash, nor any means to add one, so indoor photos must use available lighting.

Its too bad that the photo quality is so terrible, because this would be a nifty camera to own.  It is probably the smallest camera on the market at about 2" X 2".  You could have it with you wherever you go.

All in all, I cannot recommend this camera.
