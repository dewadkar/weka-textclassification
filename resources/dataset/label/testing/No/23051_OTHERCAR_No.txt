            I inherited this camera from my brother-in-law, who (for some reason) didn't want it anymore. I was so excited to have a digital camera that it took me 6 months of ownership to figure out that I hate this camera.

Here's why...

It eats batteries in one days worth of photo-taking.  

There's a green 'ready' light for the flash built into the view window that glares into your eye so that you cant see what's in the frame.

If you use the electronic view screen, it eats the batteries in half a days worth of photo-taking and also is hard to discern what is in the frame.

No zoom.

The flash is built right where your left index finger wants to go.

There are 3 settings for focussing -- really close(about 2 feet max), sorta close(between 2 & 2.5 feet), and everything else...why bother.  As a result, half of my photos turn out blurry.

The upload process to your PC is difficult to learn, and it forces you to save the pictures in an .abm file, which does not interact with any other photo viewing programs.

It additionally saves every photo as a .jpg file to some fifth level folder on your hard drive each time. (I discovered this by chance after finding half a gig of photos lingering on my hard drive that I thought were deleted!)

There are actually two benefits.  The aforementioned wrist strap is sturdy and secure.  And, I actually like the 4 flash settings of on, off, auto, and red-eye.

This camera takes decent indoor photos, but awful action shots (motion blurring).  It is one of the cheapest digital cameras you will find, and that's for a reason. Even if you have to spend twice as much, you won't be sorry that you passed on this one.
