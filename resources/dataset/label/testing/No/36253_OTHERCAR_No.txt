            You may think that you are getting a descent, cheap car when purchasing a chevy corsica, but think again, you will end up putting a lot of money into it.  My dad bought a 1991 chevy Corsica in 1992 for about 11,000 dollars.  Within a year he wanted to wreck it and collect the insurance money.  For some reason, he never did get rid of it.  It was waiting for it's incumbent owner for a couple of years.  That owner was me.  I turned 16 in early 1998 and inherited the "Mean Green Self-destructing machine".  This car broke down regularly.  I had problems with the brakes, thermostat, radiator, transmission, and power steering.  If it weren't for the fact that my parents paid for almost all of the repairs, I would have asked for a new car. As the matter of fact, once I was pretty much on my own, I ditched the corsica for a 1993 dodge intrepid (see my opinion of that). I don't think I'd be going to college if I still had the corsica. It got awful gas mileage.  I'm pretty sure it was about 20 mpg highway and 10-15 in-town.  It sounded like a diesel engine when I drove it.  When I took it on the highway, I was incapable of driving the speed limit(65 in PA) due to a couple of things: 1. It stayed on the road as well as a person with one leg would stay on a balance beam while attempting to run across  2. As soon as the speed of the corsica eclipsed 55, the whole car would start shaking.  On a positive note, it had great acceleration.  I raced people a couple of times in empty parking lots(that stuff was fun right after getting my license) and handily defeated my friends.  One drove a 1992 Nissan Maxima, and the other had an eclipse(not sure what year, maybe 97-98 range)  It also got me where I needed to go back in high school.  It was somewhat roomy too.  My friends and I once packed Ten People into mine (4 in front, 5 in back, 1 in trunk).  Unless you really want a corsica, I would not recommend buying one.
