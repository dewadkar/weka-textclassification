              I was hunting for some new transportation for a long time when I came across the Kia Sportage. I thought &quot;Wow, this is not a bad looking car and cheap too!&quot; So of course, like a fool, I did no research about the Kia and purchased one. 
   At first I was very pleased about my decision. Then about two months after my purchased the problems started! First, my air conditioning started leaking. It leaked all through the front passenger seat's carpet and made the carpet buckle like cardboard does when it gets wet. So, like anyone would do, I brought the SUV back to be fixed. 
   Then I thought it must just be bad luck, but I was wrong. About two weeks after the AC problem I starting having shorts in my wires (whatever that means)? So there I was bring the Kia right back to the place I brought it from, to be fixed. 
   Also I was a little taken on how weak or soft the paint is on this Kia. My Kia already has a ton of unnecessary scratches from normal everyday stuff. So I am figuring by the time my Kia is about two years old it will be in desperate need of a new paint job.
   Call this all bad luck if you want, but I recommend if you are planning to buy a Kia Sportage you should check out others people experiences with them. Then if you still decide to purchase one GET THE WARRANTY!<br><br>
