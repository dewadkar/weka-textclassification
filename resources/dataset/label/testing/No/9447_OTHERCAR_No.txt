            First, let me say, my husband and I did not buy this vehicle. We did go with his mother when she bought it, but we tried to discourage her from this purchase. At the time, we just thought she was spending too much money on the vehicle when she could have used that money elsewhere - but that's another story.

Mom HAD to have this vehicle. She loved the body style and the BIGNESS of the truck. For some reason she just loved Dodge. The first vehicle she ever bought new was a Dodge. Her experiences with this vehicle (and now our experiences since we inherited it from her) have made me decide to NEVER buy a Dodge. She received at least two recall notices on this truck in the first couple years she owned it.

For one thing, the power windows and locks stopped working just a few years after purchasing the vehicle. This is very irritating to me because only the driver can roll the windows up and down. 

Another problem she had was that the windows leaked. She had her truck parked outside on a rainy day while she was working, and came outside to find the carpet was soaked. Dodge fixed her window, but did not replace the carpet so she had to deal with the stale odor of wet flooring for a long time. There was also an odor problem when using the air conditioning.

The biggest point of frustration to my husband is the shocks (or lack of them). Even after replacing the shocks twice the truck bounces around like a superball on the freeway. My husband commutes over a hundred miles each day to work and feels like a milk shake when he gets home.

Sure, the truck is roomy and looks nice, but what good is that when you sacrifice that &quot;new car smell&quot; and conveniences such as power windows and locks?<br><br>
