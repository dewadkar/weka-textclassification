            1998 Dodge Avenger Base Model

Overall, a decent vehicle, unfortunately Dodge failed to manufacturer a 6-cylinder version with a manual transmission, thus I ended up with the 4-banger, still plenty of power though.  The Avenger is really the same as the Mitsubishi Eclipse, just a different body style (yes, the interior is the same too!).  It handles well and seems a bit light in the front end but nothing so serious as to make control an issue.  The factory tires are junk, replace these or ask the dealer to replace them as soon as possible.

For a sports coupe the interior actually has HUGE amounts of space.  It may seems cramped in the back seats but a six-foot person can sit upright comfortably.

The only really annoying thing about this vehicle is road noise, short of an old Ford Pickup I can think of a vehicle that produces more cabin road noise than this car.  For this reason alone (I've put 24k on this car in a year) I wouldn't recommend it to a traveler, great for low-end racing and tooling around town though.
