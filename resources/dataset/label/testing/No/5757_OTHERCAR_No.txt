            I had researched this cute-as-a-button grocery getter before purchasing it. I had just sold my 2000 BMW 323(Big time regret now! Hind-sight is always 20/20!)in hopes of getting a wagon. My husband & I went down to our local VW dealer on a Friday and test drove a little red 2001 Jetta Wagon. I loved the drive/handling as well as the safety features. It came with a Monsoon stereo in which the salesman couldn't stop singing it's praises. Don't know why, I personally think the factory stereo in my hubby's Ford SuperCrew sounds better + there's no CD player on my Monsoon.
Anyway, we went back to write up the deal, and assumed we'd pick the car up Monday or Tuesday since we'd requested tinted windows and to have the car detailed. Heck no! The sales manager insisted we drive the car home, as they were in some competition for top sales, or something...whatever. In reality, it was just to consummate the deal, which duh, I knew that. I really didn't care since we planned on going through with the purchase anyway. We just didn't want to have to drive all the way across town to drop the car off at home, since we'd planned on going out that night. I guess my point is: They were really pushy. 
About the problems. None at first. My husband wanted me to have a brand new car since I was driving (on a daily basis)to care for a terminally-ill grandparent that lived 40 miles from us. Well, I'll give it credit for the fact that it got me there when I needed to be. Strange it seems, that the car seemed to die when my grandfather did. It would no longer start, and required a jump to get going. We took it to the dealer who said they had to replace the "brain". Funny though, we still had problems after that. It still would not start. We sent it back. They replaced the battery. Still we had problems. Mind you, this has gone on for months, even the service manager took the car home with him. Finally, after the car had made many trips to the dealer, they supposedly fixed it and told us to come pick it up. My husband started it, but it wouldn't stay running. The sales people & service techs even had my husband trying both sets of keys! 
Our attorneys are now in negotiation with VW about buying the car back at full price. We've lost so much time and money on this deal, we just want it to end. VW wants to give us another car, but you know the saying, "Once bitten, twice shy". It's quite disappointing to have a brand new car that won't run. I have 3 kids, and the thought of this car breaking down on a busy highway makes me nauseous!
Hopefully our case is just a "lemon" thing, and this doesn't happen to anyone else.
