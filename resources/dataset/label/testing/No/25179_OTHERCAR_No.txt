            To be abrupt and upfront about it, the Mazda Protege is an adequate but unimpressive car. Although cars in this price range tend to not be so flashy, Mazda has succeeding in building a boring automobile.

The Protege does not have much going for it. Its motor feels very weak and probably is better suited to a large lawnmower. The one plus you may come to realize is its excellent gas mileage (29 city/ 34 highway). This light vehicle also features average handling and the more noticeable average looks...although I cannot say the Mazda Protege looks ugly, the exterior is decidedly boring and unambitious, something Mazda's rivals have already noticed with their cars. Some new safety features have been added, making this a responsible and affordable choice for those of us on a budget.

The Mazda Protege is a decent choice for a cash-strapped consumer; it is a reliable product from a good Japanese automaker. But I personally would consider other cars, such as the Ford Focus, before making such a mediocre purchase.<br><br>
