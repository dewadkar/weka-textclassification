            Just to tell a little story.  I drive a 1993 Toyota camry.  It was an option for me this past year to sell my camry and get this 1998 Accord.  I stuck with my camry.  Even with all the miles and everything.

Basically the only good things I see in this car are: it is very powerful (though there often isn't the need for so much power), it can make very tight turns (perfect for driving in the mall), lastly it looks sharp.

These few pros aside, I think when it comes down to what is really important in a car; this one is lacking.

Most importantly it drives like a go-cart. You tend to feel beat up after you have driven it for any length of time.  The accelerator is not very sensitive so you try to slowly press it and end up having to press harder than you would normally, which tends to jolt the vehicle forward.

No matter how many people are inside this car it feels cramped.  The angles of the interior move toward the center and thereby decrease space and decrease the feeling of space.  

Sitting in the front, you can see that the car narrows as it goes to the front which makes the windshield smaller and not as deep and therefore harder to see out of.  I have often found that when looking over one's shoulder to check for traffic, that this car is designed so that there is something opaque in your way.  I know I have to maneuver around to be able to see through the window.

Upon entering this car, you feel that it sits low.  It is hard to get in and out of because of this not to mention that it's tight in there anyway.

Also, the parking break is manual.  This screams 'cheap' to me and doesn't make me feel very safe.

Speaking of cheap, the interior is very cheap looking whether it is leather or not.  I have seen both and they both look like the best materials weren't used.
