            After researching mini-vans we bought a brand new 1999 Odyssey in December 1998.  Since then, I have begun a love hate relationship with it.  Okay, why love?
First off, the ride was the smoothest out of any mini-van we tried.  The Toyota Sienna was close, but the ride was bumpier, the cabin smaller, and the price tag was higher.  Ford Windstar handled pretty badly, and I really didn't like the swarmy salesperson.  The Grand Voyager came in second although it was considerably noisier and less smooth.  I think the ride is so smooth in the Honda because it sits on an Accord chassis as opposed to a truck chassis.  The <B>turning radius </B>is surprisingly agile considering it's size.  Braking is very good too. 
 
<B>Sound system? </B>  Well, there starts the love-hate relationship.  Our van did not come factory equipped with a CD player, so we had to opt for the 6-CD changer.  Do you know where they put the CD Changer?  Under the driver's seat!  What's worse is that you couldn't possibly change out the CD's without getting out of your van, fumbling with the changer and changing out CD's.  To make matters worse, the CD changer is not the most intuitive as to how the CD's or the CD rack go in.  Once you disassemble it, good luck getting it back together within 30 minutes.
  
<B>Let me get on a rant here </B>.  This van has had problems with both the rear window motors and sliding door latches.  We have had these parts changed out already 3 (yes count them) 3 times. It takes my Honda days to get these parts in. A pressure sensor for the A/C took 7 days to come into the dealer and another 5 days to schedule me into the shop! I find that waiting 12 days for a repair is totally unacceptable.  Now, maybe my beef should be with this particular dealer, but this same dealer has all these "Customer Satisfaction" award plaques hanging around.  All I can say is that no one asked me whether I was satisfied or not.   back to the door latches.... So, what's wrong with them?  They stick.  I mean, they <B>really</b> stick.  I know it's time for another replacement when I am pulling on the handle, using all my weight and the door does not budge.  Let me tell you, I am no flyweight either.  I was really concerned I would rip the handle off with the amount of force I was using.  Not to mention the 3 recalls we have had, plus electrical work, and the heating buttons have never worked right.  

Another annoying Honda thing...  Opening the driver's side door with a key will not open the other doors.  You have to open the driver's side door and open the others with the lever inside the door.  Or, unlock the passenger or trunk instead.  Honda claims this is a safety feature, I say it's bunk.

<B>Need two car seats?</B>  All I can say is GRRRR! With the way the seats are configured you have to have one car seat in the middle row and one in the back row.  Why?  Well, the seat belts are bolted on to the van next to the sliding door, and these are the seat belts you use to position the car seat in place.  With them in place in the middle row, you would never be able to get into the back seat.  That isn't so bad.  What's worse is that there is so little room in the van that the middle seat in front of the back row car seat has to be either removed from the van or folded down.  There is just no good way for another person to get into the back seat.  In case you are not following the seating arrangement, here it is with the car seats marked as X, other seats as ___

              front of car
              ___     ___

               X      this seat needs to be folded/removed

              ___ ___  X
               trunk

We have tried other configurations, but no luck.  With the car seat in the middle row, you cannot put the other car seat behind it, because there is no easy back to get the child into the back row car seat. In fact, it is nearly impossible to get the child into the back row car seat in this arrangement.  Two car seats in the back wouldn't work because one car seat is the rear facing infant type which would be difficult to get in and out.  And no dealer was willing to remove/disable the passenger side air bag, so that wasn't an option either.

So is sum, what are the pros:

<B> Pros </B> 
-- good handling
-- good braking
-- smooth, quiet ride
-- larger than most mini-vans

<B> Cons </B>
-- key entry system
-- lots of warranty work necessary
-- little room if multiple car seats are necessary
-- bad CD changer position
