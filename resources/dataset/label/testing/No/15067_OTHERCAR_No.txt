            My company had a whole bunch of these cameras and I was lucky enough to keep one for a while.  For what we used them for, these cameras were great.  We had representatives at colleges taking photos of college students and posting them on our website for them to view.  This was a lot of fun and gave us pretty good membership to our site.

The floppy disk medium was convenient enough so that our reps can go into any computer lab and upload them to our site.  It worked out wonderfully.  Students were able to log onto our site and go to their school's photo album to see their pics or pics of their friends and classmates.

I used one for my own personal use too.  I took it everywhere I went and I ditched my 35mm camera.  I thought the use of floppy disks as storage was the best idea!  There is one drawback though... the quality of the images are really poor.  Most came out fuzzy or grainy.

I now own a Sony Cybershot DSC-F505V that uses Memory Stick media and takes photos at 2.6 Megapixels.  I have a review on the F505V on epinions.com too.  It has a USB connection so transfer is fast.  The quality of the pics are superb and I get my shots printed and returned 35mm photo quality.  Unfortunately you can't do that with the Mavica shots.

So in conclusion... the Mavica is great for non-print quality photos because of it's convenience.  I'd use it for e-mail or personal web page photos.  However, I would recommend saving a bit more money and getting a camera with more resolution and picture quality like the Sony Cybershots S70 or F505V.
