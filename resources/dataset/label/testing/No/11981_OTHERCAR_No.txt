            When I initially bought this truck I was very pleased. Really, I was happy to not be driving a Ranger anymore. However, there wasn't much difference. This vehicle is just as hard to get to things under the hood as a compact Ford PU. I knew I was in trouble when I had to change the spark plugs at 100K. One the one hand it was nice to have to get some new tools. On the other hand it sucked when my new tools couldn't do the job anyway and I had to take it to a shop for something so simple. Beware the back plugs on the Vortec V6...
During a recent oil change the dealership where I foolishly purchased a minor maintenance contract informed me that over $1200 worth of work needed to be done to the vehicle. Part of this was 100K maintenance- flush the radiator, tranny, etc., but half of it had to do with seals leaking, the exhaust leaking, and so on. It seems to me that I remember having these kinds of troubles with the cars I had when I was a kid, but I somehow expected things to get better.
Something that increasingly gets my attention is the squeaking in the interior. It seems I am forever replacing screws that have shaken loose and trying to figure out how to make it stop. The plastic in the extended cab is almost always the culprit.
I think the final blow, as far as my opinion goes, came when the truck recently got stuck in 2" of mud. The tow truck driver was surprised a 4WD couldn't make it out of that soup and after a quick inspection verified that the front wheels didn't spin in 4WD. It's most likely a $30 part but will take hours to replace.
Previous reviews have been positive and I would have to say on the good side that this truck has always started for me and is comfortable for me, at 6'5", to drive. It's just what goes wrong after it starts, and after maybe 80K that is not so good.
If this matters or not, I always baby my vehicles. My wife accuses me constantly of driving like an old man and people who wind up behind me at a red light just about always end up passing me in the other lane. I am very gentle on the accelerator and do all the maintenance required at the proper time. If having to pay a couple $K/year in parts and service is my reward for going easy on this vehicle I'd almost rather beat it into the ground just so I can get a different manufacturer's truck.

08-04-02 - Well, I just wanted to give an update on that 100K maintenance. It turns out that to get the tranny pan off you have to remove a frame crossmember, otherwise there is interference. I got the tranny pan off without removing the crossmember, but broke a shift solenoid inside the transmission in the process. A transmission shop took care of me for $180.
Believe it or not, this was a relief because the transmission dipstick and tube also needed to be replaced. S-10s and Jimmys in this year range have defective dipsticks and tubes which are prone to rust, so you wind up with rust flakes in your tranny fluid. The dealership wanted $210 to flush the tranny and an unknown amount to replace the dipstick and tube, but their rough guess was in the $300 range. I was able to do the $20 dipstick and tube myself after removing the wires from the distributor cap, the cap itself, and by unsecuring the wiring harness in the back of the engine compartment and pulling that forward so that I could get my hand halfway down the back of the engine block to remove the bolt that holds the tube in place (!). The best way to do this, I found, was to prop the hood up and grab a seat on the frame member over the radiator, be patient, and take your time. If I had done this before it would have taken maybe five-six hours - it took me 11 overall, with breaks. That included the botched tranny fluid change. I should also mention that of the bolts on the transmission pan, four or five are difficult to get to. Think quarter turns with a combination wrench here. Still, I'll take $200 and the education over $500 any day. And never do a tranny fluid change myself again with this truck... The rest of the maintenance went as planned - with lots of rags, WD40, and the basic parts.
