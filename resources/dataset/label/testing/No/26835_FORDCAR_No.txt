            My mother has one of these monstrocities, and I drove it for the first time a few weeks ago.  It was the most nerve racking experience of my life.  Going from my small Toyota Camry to the Ford Expedition reminded me of the mock-suv, the Canyonero, from tv's The Simpsons; you remember the theme song: &quot;fifty yards long and two lanes wide it's fifty tons of American pride.&quot;  

I love all the features on it: led showing &quot;miles to empty&quot; or &quot;miles per gallon,&quot; six disc cd player, auto climate control, blinkers in the side mirrors, and room for seven comfortably. It was definately powerful, and the power steering was very responsive, but I couldn't stop worrying about hitting the car next to me or the curb.  

In short, if you are a very experienced driver and want luxury in an SUV, buy this vehicle... if you're even the slightest bit nervous about driving, get something smaller!<br><br>
