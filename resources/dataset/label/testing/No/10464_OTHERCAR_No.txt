            I got this camera as a gift in December 2003 while waiting for the prices to come down on 2.0 & 3.0 megapixel cameras. I probably wouldn't have chose the particular model.

The Medium and High Quality photo settings with Medium or Low compression yield the best results.  You can fit a lot of photos on the low image / high compression settings, but they're rather poor quality.  Medium and High quality photos create images that could be printed with good quality on a 5x7.  I wouldn't trust Medium quality for an 8x10, but the High quality would definately print a good picture.

The special photo settings for Black&White and Sepia-tone are great.  They were a little difficult to maneuver to select, but once selected, they took some awesome shots!

The Zoom is Digital Zoom, not Optical, so the pictures taken with any level of Zoom are darker, blurrier, overall poor quality.  If you're looking for a camera with Zoom capabilities, go for the Elph-class, which has optical zoom and creates a fairly good zoom image.

The worst aspect of this camera is the BATTERY-SUCKING.  On Two AA's (tried Energizer and Duracell), I couldn't get more than 20 shots or so before having to replace the batteries.  The screen and autofocus seem to drain it the most.  I purchased rechargeable NiMH batteries with a re-charger for about $20-- came with 6 AA's and 2 AAA's and the charger.  Those batteries at least gave me about 100 shots or so.  But be forewarned!  Do not buy this camera without getting rechargeable batteries!!
