            I am so grateful that I can finally tell the world what I think of my 1995 Dodge Intrepid.  It has been a real lemon!

When I first bought my car, I loved it!  I thought it was the coolest car I ever owned.  I loved the color, how the stereo sounded, and how well it drove.  It also had the smoothest ride.  I was impressed with how it held the road.  I was truly in love!

That love turned to hate.  The car had to be in the shop more times than I can even remember!  I had a water pump put in but something went wrong and it had to have another one.  I thought the best thing to do would be to have the dealer put one in rather than a local mechanic.  It cost me $300 for a water pump to be put in.  But, oh well, I thought it would be the best in the long run.  My family and I went on a trip to North 
Carolina from Illinois and guess what.  We broke down in the mountains on the way home!  There was a bolt torqued too tight, it sheared off and went through some stuff!  We had to drive a little bit to be able to get to the side of the road and it overheated!!  Guess what - warped heads!!
We stayed in a motel for two days and ended up renting a vehicle to get home.  I guess this really wasn't the car's fault as much as the dealer's.  We were 300 miles over the warranty, so the dealer wouldn't stand by their work.

A while after that ordeal, the check engine light started to come on.  I went to the dealer to have it checked out.  (What a doofus I am to go back to them!)  Well they said it was something to do with the catalytic converter and it would cost $200 for this repair.

The air conditioner had to be fixed early on in the life of this car.  I almost had that repair blocked out of my memory banks.  Well, anyway, I will have to put 2 or 300,000 miles on this car to break even with all the repairs.

Oh, by the way.  My niece has a Dodge Intrepid and she has already put $5000 in repairs in her car!  So maybe my car isn't the greatest lemon, but I still feel like painting it yellow.<br><br>
