            I bought my '97 Accent GT because my previous vehicle at the time needed major work (a 10-yr-old Nissan truck) and I was not in the position to spend a lot of money.  I *thought* I would be better off with a new car that had a warranty as opposed to a used one that could have been a rebuilt wreck or had other unseen problems.  I wanted a car that got good mileage as I commuted approximately 75 miles to and from work.  Of the cars I looked at, I can definitely say the Accent beat the Ford Aspire.  There aren't many Hyundai dealers in my area, and the local dealer (Sonny Hancock Chevy/Cadillac/Mazda/Hyundai, Gastonia NC) has a reputation for shady business practices, which I was aware of.  I was not aware just how shady though.  I researched the dealer cost of the car on the Internet and made a fair offer to the salesman, who said my figures (the Internet's figures) were wrong.  So I upped my offer a few hundred dollars and a deal was made.  Later in the Business Manager's office, after the contracts were signed, he made a point to tell me that yes, my original figures were correct.  Why do I tell you all this about the dealer when this review is supposed to be about the car?  Well, unless you buy directly from the factory, your local dealer represents the manufacturer and influences your opinion of the car probably more than the manufacturer does.  If Hyundai expects to win more customers, they had better pay more attention to their dealers practices.  Now on to the car.  For the first month or so, it was GREAT...fun to drive...peppy...easy to maneuver and park..and it looked sporty.  Then the trouble began.  In the 3 years and 51,000 miles I've owned this car, I cannot count how many times it has been in for service, often for the same thing.  Replaced so far: Clutch master cylinder, CV joint boots, entire right rear suspension, windshield wiper motor (twice).  Other problems include interior door panels that still leak after numerous trips to the dealer, rusted sunroof frame, inoperative backup lights, and a serious hesitation problem that the dealer says is due to dirty injectors.  I find this hard to believe because I always use 93 octane Amoco, which I also use in my truck which has 160,000 miles on it and has never required fuel injector cleaning. Other minor nit-picky problems are body panels that are so thin that leaning on the car while at the gas pump actually dents the fender (and no, I am not obese), dash lights that go out on a whim, and cup holders that are an afterthought.  Oh yeah...and if it rains, leave it in the driveway because the car will not stay on the road.  Add all that to the fact that after 3 years I still owe more on the car than it's worth, and you can see why I cannot recommend this vehicle (or any Hyundai) to anyone.  I look forward to the day when I can trade it in on an F250.<br><br>
