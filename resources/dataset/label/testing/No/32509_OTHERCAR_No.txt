            I had this car for a few days when I was out of town and got to check it out completely.  This was the 3.0 V6 with a manual tranny.  The first thing I noticed was the tremendous lack of power.  Perhaps I have been totally spoiled by the 260 horses in my Acura TL Type S.

When I entered the car for the first time I noticed that the "cockpit" had a driver oriented feel.  The steering wheel was contoured like a race car.  I was incredibly surprised that the car had 10-way power seats and dual zone climate control.  Pretty cool!

The next stage was to drive it hard in the twisties.  I noticed that the handling was very impressive.  The roadholding is like .88g I think, and it definitely takes the corners pretty well.  I am sure the Quattro will also be very beneficial in inclement weather.

The seats were heated and everywhere the quality of materials inside the car was impeccable.  

The manual transmission is JUNK!  Audi probably makes the worst manuals I have ever driven.  Both the clutch and shifter throws are horrendous and is a shame for a car that claims "performance"!  By contrast, the shift gate on a BMW or Acura CL Type S is super precise!

If I were to choose between the Acura TL Type S and this one, I would still opt for the Acura.  The Acura is generally packaged better and costs less, it is a whole lot of car more for the money with power to shame this Audi outright.  

Handling is marginally worse in the Acura but unless you're driving on the track or like a lunatic you will not notice the difference.  The Acura being FWD also helps with bad weather.  And the Acura CLS6 with the Helical Limited slip diff will match the handling despite being a bigger car.

Audi's safety record is poor - which is quite surprising for a german car.  By comparison the Acura TL Type S is an IIHS best pick! If you don't believe me check it out yourself... http://www.iihs.org

Audi reliability is very poor.  I know many people who own Audis with regular visits to the dealership.  Visit this link for your reference: http://www.myaudittsucks.com
Do you still want to buy an Audi...I don't think so!

Forget this Audi, get the Acura or Infiniti!
