            I looked at the Toyota 4-Runner Limited, Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and the Nissan Pathfinder LE. I was leaning towards the 4-Runner until I drove the 2001 Pathfinder LE. That cinched it. The new 240 HP engine is incredible. Blows everything else in its class out of the water. 

I've owned a 2001 Pathfinder LE for about 3 months now and have experienced no problems. Most of my driving has been around town. The ride is well controlled. There's plenty of power to pass on the freeway which I did not expect in an SUV. When test driving the 4-Runner I was very disappointed with its passing power which is one reason I decided to test drive the Pathfinder. 

Compared to the Grand Cherokee the engine is quiet and much smoother. I can't stress this enough. My wife drove the Grand Cherokee and could not believe how rough it felt compared to the Pathfinder. Road and tire noise is not intrusive, and I was surprised at how quiet it rides at cruising speeds compared to our VW Passat. 

We own a dog and one feature I did like about the 4-Runner was the roll down back window. The Pathfinder has the pop out and lift up type but it's either completely open or completely closed. I would like to be able to roll it down just a bit for the dog but it's not a big deal. 

There are many small compartments to store items like sunglasses and Compact disks. The interior feels well planned out and well built. The leather seats are wonderful. 

Overall I'm very happy with this purchase. If you are looking for nice riding, well made SUV make sure you drive the Pathfinder before buying a higher priced 4-Runner or Land Rover. <br><br>
