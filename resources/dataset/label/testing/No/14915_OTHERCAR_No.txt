            This thing is great fun.  I love that it saves on 3.5 inch floppy disks, that is great, and very handy.  It also has many other features that make it fun to play around with.  That said, it isn't worth the money.  I mean, for $500 dollars, all it can is take simple point and shoot pictures.  Again, I think it is very handy, and as far as digital cameras go, it it  nice, but I don't think that is quite enough.  It doesn't have any control over shutter speed or aperture.  In low light, you are screwed either way (without the flash, the picture is blurred, with the flash, the picture is harsh and unnatural).  This is a good camera, but for that amount of money it doesn't do much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <br><br>
