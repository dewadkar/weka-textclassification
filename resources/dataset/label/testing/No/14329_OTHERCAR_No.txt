            Ever heard the expression �you get what you pay for?� Well as it turns out, that handy saying is not always true. The Jaguar XJ-8 has me hatching a new theory, it goes something like this: once the price of a car tops, say $50,000 or so, you stop getting more for your money, and you�re just spending more money because you can. Nothing wrong with people who can afford cars costing $100,000 or $300,000 or even more, of course at some point one has to ask themselves if maybe it�s not, at least, morally questionable to spend half a million dollars on a new car (old cars are exempt form this theory as they usually grow in value unlike new cars) when a car costing roughly one tenth that amount will do the job quite nicely. 

Let me illustrate my point about not getting more for your money past a certain dollar amount. If you compare a $3000 used car to a new Kia costing about $9000, you clearly have something for the extra money you spent. The same would be true when comparing a $9000 Kia to an $18,000 Toyota, similarly when comparing an $18,000 Toyota to a $30,000 Acura, and so on, and so on, and so on. The real question is, what do you really get for your money after $50,000 or so? 

The Jaguar XJ8 Vanden Plas is a perfect example. Certainly this is a nice, good-looking car, but is it worth nearly $70,000? Let�s not count the envy of friends and neighbors as a justification for buying an expensive car, that is just plain sick. If you need that kind of approval, seek help quickly so you can stop being one of the things that are wrong with this world. Uhhh� back to the car. There are advantages to owning an XJ8. Firstly, it is a beautiful car inside and out, you can tell the level of quality, in the materials alone, is much higher than most other cars on the road today. For a big car, the XJ handles quite well. Problem is, many other cars can do the same thing at a lower price. 

Although the interior of the XJ8 is very luxurious (the wood is simply stunning), there are some aspects which are missing given the price. A 6 disc CD changer is nice, but the changer is mounted in the trunk while less expensive cars such as the Cadillac DeVille have a changer in the glove box, and a single play CD slot in the dash just in case you�re suddenly struck by the urge to hear some Corr�s but forgot to put one of their CD�s in the changer. Is this nit picking? Sure but for $70K nit picking is all that is left. The XJ�s seats are covered by super soft leather of the highest quality (I can still smell it), yet the front seats are not all that comfortable. The front seats have an odd narrow feel, there is plenty of legroom, but one feels a bit crowded from the sides. The instrument cluster provided no trip computer, simply two trip meters. Even a Buick Regal has a trip computer. Rear seat room is more than plentiful and borders on limo like. The center, folding armrest in the back seat lacks cup holders or storage, again a much cheaper Buick or Cadillac would have such an item. 

On the road the big Jaguar has a decidedly firm ride, some might even say a surprisingly firm ride. The Vanden Plas is an extended length Jag and although the handling is quite capable for such a large car, there is a bit of that bouncy feeling from the rear, similar to the ride of a typical limousine. While low profile, Pirelli p6000 tires improve handling, they do nothing to soften the firm ride or quiet the abundant road noise. The XJ8 suffers terribly from road noise as well as wind noise, surely this is due to the "classic" design of the exterior, but whatever the reason, one would expect a bit more serenity inside the cabin of a $70,000 car. 

The 4.0L V8 is powerful, boasting 290 hp. However this new Jaguar lacks the smoothness found on the much older XJ6. The older inline 6-cylinder engine was somewhat horsepower challenged, but it was sure smooth. Strangely the current V8 lacks the velvety feel of the older engine. Certainly 290 hp is nothing to laugh at, and a quick jab at the accelerator proves this big cat is no kitten. The Jag can really gets under way in a hurry, but lacks the sheer muscle of the Cadillac DeVille DTS or even a BMW 540. 

Overall the 2001 Jaguar XJ8 Vanden Plas is a very nice car, it is beautiful inside and out, has all the trapping of a proper luxury car and yet somehow manages to, ever so slightly, miss the mark. 20 years ago no one would have guessed that a company like Toyota, with their Lexus division, would be such a serious contender in the luxury car market, and yet that is just what has happened. What Lexus lacks in prestige and heritage, it more that makes up for in luxury and refinement. The Jaguar XJ8 is an excellent car... for about $48,000. The good news is that Jag is replacing the XJ8 next year with an all new model, in the mean time, those who must pilot a Jaguar will have to be content with the S Type, XKR or an older XJ6. Any of those cars will offer all that Jaguar has come to stand for at a substantial savings.
