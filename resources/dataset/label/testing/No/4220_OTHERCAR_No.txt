            I bought a 1996 Caravan, bought into the whole &quot;car of the year&quot; advertisement.  It's okay, usually, but there are problems.  My main gripe is the electrical locking system.  

It all started when the van was only a year old.  When the automatic locks came on, I'd hear a buzz along with the click.  Then I started getting the warning light for &quot;door ajar&quot;.  All the doors were securely closed, but I'd pull over and re-close them anyway.  Then a block later the warning light would come back on.  It was usually accompanied by a ding, and the interior lights would come on.  Then the warning light would go on and off several times, along with the ding, and interior lights flashing.  Anyone watching must have thought I was having fun playing with the lights.  But it wasn't any fun at all!

The locks would also click on and off, eventually to machine gun speed rat-a-tat-a-tat, while the lights flashed like a disco, and the constant ding-ding-ding.....well, you see what I mean, right?  That with kids in the back is enough to drive anyone off the edge!  But of course it would never happen at the service department, so it must have been &quot;all in my head&quot;.

Then about a year or so ago, I started having trouble getting in the van.  I'd press the button to disarm the alarm and unlock the doors, but the doors did not unlock.  After trying a few times, I'd just use the key.  Now it's the rear driver's side door.  I can't use the key for that one, because there is no keyhole on it.  It just won't open at all, from the inside or outside.  I just had it &quot;fixed&quot; with a new latch, to the tune of $400+, and it worked for about a day after that.  I'm taking it back to the shop on Monday.  :-/

Oh and I forgot to mention the wipers that refuse to work....but only on rainy days...<br><br>
