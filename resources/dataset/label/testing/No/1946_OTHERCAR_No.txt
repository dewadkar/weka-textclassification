            I bought an SE last month after driving a baseline rental.  Like a lot of buyers, I wanted a performance car that I can haul the family around in.
It was the engine I fell in love with, but after driving the car for a while, I wish I had bought a Passat.  Yea, the Maxima looks good on paper and the engine spins out nice, but what is missing is a soul of a car you can love over the long term.

What I find particularly annoying is the lack of straight line stability.  An hour on the highway at 80mph is truly a taxing experience to visually confirm where the car is going.  Tracking is so poor that I found myself checking the trees along the road to check for crosswinds.  Not a car I want to take on a long trip.

Around town, I've found the automatic to be indecisive at times, especially from 1st to 2nd slow to medium acceleration.  Trying to dial in just a little throttle near the shift point can often produce an unwanted burst of acceleration.  You have to be either Speed Racer or grandma to keep the shifts smooth.  I find this very annoying.

Although the suspension does a good job sticking on the corners, it does not give me the kind of feedback that allows me to push it hard.  I never seem to know if there is more to go or it will break loose at any moment, especially on wet surfaces.  I'm willing to put up with a harsh ride for good handling, but with the SE you just get the harsh ride because you can't really take advantage of the cornering abilities.

On the positive side, I agree with the others that this is a lot of car for the money with a lot of features.  This car certainly impresses on a drive around the block.  The engine really sings and the exhaust note and underhood sounds are like music.  The torsional rigidity is excellent and not a rattle anywhere.  For a non-enthusiast, I think this is a good car.

I have had German cars in the past.  To truly love them, it takes more than a ride around the block, and ones affection tends to grow with time, just the opposite of the Maxima.
