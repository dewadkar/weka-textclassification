                 I purchased the Mercedes C-280 new in 1995.  I liked the styling, and more importantly, the performance of the vehicle: it responded with the sure-footedness and quickness of a well-refined sports car.  Those elements remained throughout my two-year ownership of the car.

     Because I had previously owned a larger Mercedes model, I trusted the integrity of the craftsmanship.  This however, was not warranted.  The vehicle had numerous cosmetic flaws; the back door rubber seal protruded when the door was closed, and the back glass trim had spaces of silver metal showing through.  

     The vehicle had an oil leakage problem, beginning with the drive home.  This took a total of nine days to remediate, after determining that the facing on the oil pan was irregular, and a normal gasket would not retain the oil.  The problem was eventually solved by using an off-set gasket.

     Within one year the vehicle began to experience many electrical problems; the cruise control went out,  the clock went out, the entire dash went out twice, and the dash was removed and reinstalled twice in an attempt to eliminate squeak-rattles.

     Despite my troubles with the car, I loved driving it.  I traded it after two years, because it had gone out of warranty and I was concerned that the existing electrical problems would only exacerbate others waiting to happen.  I traded for a new E320 last year, and enjoy and appreciate the refinements and lack of need for adjustments or replacements.<br><br>
