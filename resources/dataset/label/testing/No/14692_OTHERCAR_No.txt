              I bought a '99 Forester &quot;S&quot; for its safety and sure-footedness, but got lots of headaches and a car I just didn't want.
  Eleven days after driving off in my brand new Forester the thing would not start.  After three tows to the dealer and their saying we cannot find a problem, I made them troubleshoot the car in my driveway.  The solution was a starter solinoid that was shorting out.
  When we had a loner Forester, my wife and I noticed that it drove with fewer jerks as it shifted gears.  I alerted the dealer who promptly told me that their diagnostic computer could not find a problem.  The problem is a distinct jerk when the Forester shifts gears from 1st to 2nd and going up steep hills shifting in any gear.  Also, the gas pedal is like a hair trigger.  One touch and the car races ahead.  The dealer mechanics said there was no problem and nothing that they could do, but a sales person said that sometimes the computer that controls the transmission can be in sport mode all the time.  This would show up by the transmission shifting at a higher RPM.
  I have asked the dealer to find a suitable replacement Forester, but the smiling used car manager has not called me back and I am now looking for a used Toyota Sienna.  Hope you have better luck than I with this not so sporty car.<br><br>
