            I have always loved Toyota products.  Both their stylish looks and their dependability have kept me coming back to them over the years.  I've owned a Celica, 4Runner and now this Tacoma pick-up.  I must say this truck has disappointed me.

I wanted this truck for his sporty good looks.  In spite of his lackluster performance, my truck is still the cutest one in the parking lot.  Both the four wheel drive model and the two wheel "Pre-Runner" sit up high and mighty for a commanding view of the road.

<B>Picking Nits - The Cab of the Pickup</B>
The only good thing I can say about the interior cab space is that everything within the cab is within easy arm's reach.  Most of the driver's space is taken by the steering wheel.  Getting in and out is a drag if you are holding anything in your hands.  I have a one-year-old sidekick who likes to ride around with me, so I carry a car seat in the front passenger seat.  That is the only place it will fit, and it takes up every inch of front seat space that isn't taken up by me.   So my purse, diaper bag and other passengers have to ride in the passenger floor board or in the back seat.

The back seat consists of two fold-down cushions and two shoulder harness seat belts.  Anyone over 10 would not be comfortable back there, and even my 9-year-old complains now and then.  The front seats do not lean forward or move forward enough for easy access to the back seat.  It's just as easy to crawl over the top of the seat itself.  There are two cup-holders that slide out of each of the rear seat bottoms.  They take up the space that a person's feet would use if a person were sitting there.  So you can have either passengers or drinks in the back seat, but not both.

The cup holder in the front is located on the passenger side under the ashtray.  It holds only a small cup and you can't open the ashtray if a cup is there.  I keep my change in the ashtray and this is an inconvenience when I'm traveling through toll booths.

<B>More Serious Problems - Performance, Gas Mileage, Mechanical Parts</B>

My daily drive takes me 50 miles each way along a two-lane highway through beautiful east Texas countryside.  Slower drivers are inevitable, and while most country folks are courteous enough to pull off to the right shoulder and let me by, the rest of them represent obstacles to me and my little truck.  I dare not try to pass unless I can see miles and miles of clear lane ahead and no uphills.  The four cylinder engine is not made for acceleration of any sort.

The gears do not shift smoothly.  There's always a "yank" when it settles into gear and I let off the clutch.  This happens no matter how I let out the clutch, slow or fast.

The hubs are difficult to lock and unlock for four-wheel-drive, not to mention the plain inconvenience of having to do that in the first place.

I bought the truck used at about a year old.  In the first month I had it in the shop twice for warranty repair work on the wiper washer system, turn signal and the brakes.  In general, this truck is not as well built as I expected a Toyota to be.  It rattles and moans a lot and I keep noticing weird sounds coming from the engine and wheels.

Since the truck is small and not very powerful or fast I expected gas mileage to be in the mid-twenties, especially with all the highway driving I do.  I find I am lucky to get 21 MPG and I fill it up every other day.
