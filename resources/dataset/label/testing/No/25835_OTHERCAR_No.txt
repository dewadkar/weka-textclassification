            I bought this car out of an impulse, because of its good looks, because I like big, comfy cars, and because it's exotic (at least in here in Germany...) but still a trustworthy brand.
I've owned the car for 30 months now, doing about 50% city, 20% highway and 30% vacation. Never been offroad with the vehicle.

Pros:
+++++

a) Engine
Very powerful, silent and reliable engine, neither me nor my predecessor has ever had to take it to the shop or experienced any problems with it. Routine maintenance tasks are easy for a do-it-yourselfer: Everything is accessible and robust, no non-standard tools required. This engine has run about 160.000 km (120.000 miles ?) so far. The automatic transmission hasn't caused troubles, too.

b) Body
The body is solid and shows to signs of corrosion, even though it hasn't seen a garage for the past six years. The same goes for the doors, the hood and the tailgate. The tailgate latch is the only exception: all the paint came off and it's rusty all over.

c) Brakes
The brakes brake unobstrusively and quick, the handling while brakeing is not as good as with ordinary cars, but better than I expected. The disks show only little signs of wear.

d) Interior
Due to the vehicles height, the overview and the headroom are good. The instrumens are not beautiful, but functional. The leather on the seats still looks good, as do the plastic parts. Some find the seats too soft and surely the back seat passengers must either have short legs or be very enduring.

Cons:
----

a) Electrical Gadgets
Almost all electrical gadgets were prone to error: The electrical rear view mirrors, the infrared door opener, the electrical window openers, the cruise control, the wiper motors. And the reason has always been the same: Contact problems - hard to track down but inexpensive. Chrysler could have used some superior parts here, as they obviously did under the hood and with the lighting. I've never had these contact problems with core electrics or electronics.

b) Some Secondary Mechanical Things
A similar pattern applies to accessability and quality of secondary things like the instrument control panel and the wiring and built of the intestines of the doors (locks and window mechanism): Whereas under the hood you see only solid and well-thought engineering, these secondary things are obfuscated to the point of inaccessability and of minor quality. Some more screws instead of 'snap-fit' thingies would have made life a lot easier.

c) Keys
The car keys are of unworthy quality and bend or break too easily, because the are too small.


Mixed blessings:
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

a) Handling
The car handles surprisingly well in the city and overland, winter and summer. No weird reactions whatsoever. Highway driving, however, is not too pleasant because you really have to concentrate to keep a straight line at high speed: The power steering is simply too powerful and indirect. The tires and the drive train get quite loud too, unless serviced frequently. (Oil change and greasing) Btw.: This car really does still have some of these grease nipples I thought were extinct since the fifties! I personally like this 'feature', folks that do not exactly enjoy lying on their backs underneath their cars probably won't.

b) Weirdly, some parts of the exhaust system do hardly ever corrode, and others rust like a soup can. Probably the quality of replacement parts is not uniform.

c) Heating &amp; Air Condition
Given the size of the engine, the heating is sub-standard: It takes an eternity to warm up, and on cold days I've never felt more than lukewarm, literally. The air condition is somewhat better, but I doubt that it can counter real heat.

I hope I made a useful contribution.
