            I am the unhappy owner of a Chrysler minivan and after having to deal with the company I would never purchase another vehicle from them again. The performance of the vehicle on the whole has been good (the vehicle is a 98)however my concern is with the attitude of the company and its dealers!! My ordeal began when the brakes needed to be replaced, I brought my vehicle into the dealer where it was purchased from (Sevenview - Ontario, Canada)thinking this is where I would get the best service. A mistake I will not make again - total cost was $500!!!!
While the car was in for service I requested a second childseat bolt to be installed. This safety issue cost me $37.50!!!! Something that should in my opinion be a FREE service. I contacted DaimlerChrysler Canada and was told that the bolt was supplied free of charge, however they had no juristiction on what the dealerships charged for installation. (Basically &quot;there's nothing we can do for you and go away!!&quot;) Neeedless to say I am disgusted with the dealership and will never bring my car back there again but also in the attitude of the corporation. As far as I am concerned the majority of people purchasing minivans are families,(with more than one child)and the childseat bolts should be mandatory!!! 
If the saftey of my children is not a concern to this company then how can I be sure that vehicle saftey on the whole is a concern!!!!<br><br>
