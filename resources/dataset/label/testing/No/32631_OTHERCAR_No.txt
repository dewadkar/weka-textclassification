              Well, not exactly but it has gotten me this far! I own a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire and must write an epinion on it for everyone to see.

  First off let me tell you that I am only going to explain to you the interior and durability of this car. I am not going to go into great detail about the engine and stuff because I really no nothing about that stuff, that is my husbands area.

  I bought my car in 1998 and it had 5 miles on it and that was my damage for test driving it. I instantly loved it because it was small,inexpensive,and was brand new.I bought the car and have had it ever since then.

  Well that was then and this is now! Two years later... I have two children,two car seats,two diaper bags,one husband,and much other needed equipment that must go with us where ever we go! This car is way too small to be a family car! The durability isn't so great either. My back seat is caving in from the pressure of both of the children's car seats and I can't seem to fix it! It looks as though it was just thrown in there and looks very generic.

  The drivers side seat belt broke and I can hear it rattling in my ear the whole time I am driving! My brakes....I have replaced them twice since I have had the car. My husband say's it is because they are anti lock brakes but I don't see me having to replace brakes every year! He tries to take up for the car but I owe $9,000.00 on it and it is just not right!

  The odd thing about it all is I always take very good care of my car. My husband keeps the oil changed,rotates the tires, and the whole nine yards. I keep the interior clean and wash the car once every other week.

  My conclusion is that this is not a very good family car and I better start looking for a heavy duty car quick before my children get older and the whole thing falls apart on me.

<i>I think to myself,why didn't I get that extended warranty?</i><br><br>
