            I bought this vehicle brand new 4 years ago as my family was expanding and I needed a vehicle which could carry large loads.  The Discovery seemed a nicely designed 4x4 and its air of adventure made it an attractive car.  Looks can be very deceiving.
The car drove nicely and was quite pleasant for long trips and for the occasional off road excursion.  I participated in dealership sponsored events and every thing seemed nice and pretty.
Within a few months of ownership I started to realize this vehicle was not properly put together as I had to take the car for service and unexpected repairs, i.e. Power Steering had to be replaced, ABS braking system had to be replaced, a whole number of gaskets were replaced to try to fix an ever present oil leak. The whole transmission had to be replaced as I was left stranded in the middle of a busy intersection with no gears!  Fortunately the warranty covered all these major repairs.
Just when I thought there was nothing left that could go wrong, the engine
blows!  Now I'm facing a $7000 repair bill, and this from a car that had all scheduled maintenance done at the authorized dealer<br><br>
