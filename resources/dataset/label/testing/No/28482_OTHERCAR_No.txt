            I did a lot of research into which SUV I would purchase before deciding to buy my 2002 GMC Envoy.  I decided to buy the SLE model with 4WD, 6 CD system, cloth seats, and basically the standard options which are all very nice, including the On-Star system.  The interior appointments are only a little better than the Ford Expedition I test drove, and I think the Jeep Grand Cherokee I rented once through work had a little nicer interior as compared to the Envoy.

However, after the first week of ownership the engine developed a very loud "valvetrain" noise, as the service advisor described it.  I guess you shouldn't believe everything you read, because after two and a half weeks of ownership, my new Envoy is sitting in the dealership's service center with NO engine!  Yep, they are having to completely replace the engine because of a serious manufacturers defect.  After taking the faulty engine out and completely disassembling it, even the regional GM factory rep isn't exactly sure what the problem is - they THINK its a faulty piston (maybe even two).

Of course, everyone who knows about my new car woes immediately says, "of course, General Motors is going to give you a new car, aren't they."  NOPE!  I've asked for a replacement vehicle, but they've decided to do just exactly what they are required to do by the warranty - nothing more, nothing less.  So much for the Customer Care they keep talking about.

Now, certainly every manufacturer churns out a lemon or two or more, and I certainly hope that's all I've unfortunately been saddled with (and a VERY EXPENSIVE lemon it is).  

All I'm saying is this - this is a new model introduced by General Motors and being touted by all the professional automobile reviewers as the next best thing to drive-in fast food but anyone even remotely considering purchasing a GMC Envoy should do a good bit more research into actual performance of the vehicles that have been sold to date.  Maybe someone out there knows of a good source for checking on consumer complaints about new car problems and can post it.  I would certainly recommend taking a look around your community and seeing how many new Envoys you see driving around - it may not just be the expense, it may the reliability of the vehicle when you notice very few of these cars on the road.  

I also recommend that you contact General Motors to find out what their policy is concerning replacing manufacturers defective automobiles if you have any hesitancy about your potential GM car purchase.  

Lucky (if anything positive can be found here) for me is that where I live (NC) the state has a pretty good "Lemon Law" and if the replacement engine doesn't solve my Envoy's problems then I can eventually have the car replaced or repurchased, and get $$ damages to boot.  In case you're wondering, I have spoken with an attorney who specializes in warranty and Lemon Law matters and he says I have a very good case once my vehicle problems (number of times in shop, number of times to be repaired) meet the Lemon Law threshold.  

So, BUYER BEWARE and educate yourself before purchasing.
