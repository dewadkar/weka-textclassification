            I thought that readers might be interested in the problems I have experienced since purchasing a new SE 4.0L Range Rover in June 1998. 
The vehicle has the following history :- 
1. Vehicle has been back to the dealer, on 14 occasions in under 51,000kms.
2. Water pump replaced at 11,526kms. Top radiator hose replaced at 21,665kms.
3. Rear brake pads replaced at 21,665 kms and then all brake pads and disks replaced at 26,809 kms. On 2 subsequent occasions the brake pedal went flat to floor when as the vehicle started. Accumulator replaced.
4. Severe steering wander and extreme steering vibration required the replacement of a drag link ball joint at 32,462 kms and a steering damper at 36,265 kms. Both components replaced again at 50,981 kms.
5. The front differential has been rebuilt at 50,981.
6. The vehicle has been riddled with poor build problems characterised by recurring electrical, trim and panel faults and failures such as tailgate not locking and/or not opening, remote locking not working, severe splash back when filling petrol tank, glove box not closing properly, rear seat not locking in properly, wheel caps falling off, exhaust heat shield rattling loose, air conditioner requiring the blend motor to be replaced and of course the compulsory oil leaks. 

Rover Australia have had to be pushed to repair the vehicle. On 3 separate occasions they have failed to respond to my call/fax to either their Customer Service department or senior management. Eventually they :-
i. increase the warranty period to 3 years and 75,000kms (other major manufacturers give 100,00km standard anyway)
ii. offered $4,800 goodwill if I purchase a significantly lower specification Discovery, and paid an additional $ 21,000. 

All requests to have the vehicle replaced have been rejected because in their opinion, the vehicle is sound. However they have consistently refused my request for a letter confirming that the vehicle is to a build, reliability and safety standard with which Rover are happy. 

As a last resort I parked the vehicle outside Land Rover dealers with signs on it, advertising the service history of the vehicle. Rover Australia had their solicitors threaten me with defamation which I find an interesting way to handle dissatisfied customers. 

I have now travelled in excess of 1,000km just returning the vehicle for warranty work, let alone the 35-40 hours of my time driving it back and forth. And just to make me really happy, based on figures supplied by the dealer I purchased the vehicle from, Austral Land Rover, my $101,000 vehicle is now worth $55,000, a devaluation of over 45% in just 22 months. 

Mine may well be an isolated incidence, but I would be very interested to hear from any one who have similar stories to tell, especially from Australia.
