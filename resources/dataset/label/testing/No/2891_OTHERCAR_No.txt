            Absolutely the worst car I ever ownded as far as reliability!  An owner of approximately 4 years I invested upward of $10K into the vehicle in repairs!  Road side assistance is reliable-I only wish the car was!
   Difficult finding an adequate mechanic outside of the dealership who are vastly overpriced.  Parts are expensive and Mercedes oriented.  Special tools are a problem for the do-it-yourselfer.  About the only thing you can do is change the plugs and oil.  An example of overpricing?  A sun visor clip-$15 from Mercedes.  $1.00 coat hanger from a discount store works quite well!
   In summarizing--This is a rich mans hobby car.  Over 100,000 miles be prepared to invest heavily!!
