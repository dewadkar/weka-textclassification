            I purchased this car in March of 2000 after a great test drive.  The dealer allowed me to drive a demo off road and use the ABS in the rain.  Previously I had leased an 1997 Impreza Outback Sport and was very pleased with it.  I just wanted to get a larger vehicle with AWD.

I decided on a blue one with the All Weather Package since I do a lot of skiing.  At the time of this review it's got 7500 miles on it, so I feel I've driven it enough to offer a good opinion.

Good: The car is really quiet inside.  I have the 6-disc CD changer and it works great.  The gauge cluster is easily visible and understandable.  However, the controls for fog lamps, defrost and cruise on/off are a bit out of the way.  The main cruise controller (Acc/Res, Cancel) is in the perfect location, and I prefer it over the ones on the 1998 Accord.  Leg room is great for backseat passengers, although if one has a Limited the sunroof can make a taller persons head hit the ceiling.  The ground clearance is great, very SUVish.  And the gas mileage is excellent for the vehicle type, I get about 26 mpg with city and highway driving.  A nice touch is note in the gauge cluster indicating which side the fuel door is on.  

Bad:  Unfortunately for me, the bads are pretty bad.  After driving the car for a while I noticed that it pulls to the left considerably.  It fatigues me greatly while driving and is bordering on dangerous.  The most annoying thing about this car is that the steering wheel will vibrate back and forth at about 65-75 MPH.  Alignment, wheel balance, tire pressure, and tire rotation have all failed to fix either flaw.  Trouble is the vibration doesn't happen all the time, even if it's the same stretch of road.  The car always pulls left, the road crown doesn't matter.  I'm at the end of my patients with seeing dealers because it's a huge inconvenience for me to drive to one.  

I'd sum up my ownership experience with this latest Subaru as very poor.  It's tiring to drive, and that wobble drives me nuts.  To top it off I have to pay the payment each month.  Subtract these big problems and the car is great.  Test drive one at length however and look for the wobble.  I have even noticed it on ones I have rented.  

I'll update this if I solve my problems.
