                 The Dodge Neon, is alright in some aspects.  It has good acceleration, control, looks pretty good, close to the ground so it doesn't get thrown all over the road in harsh weather, wide enough body where it doesn't flip on you.  It is an alright car to have for your first car.  It is cheap, insurance isn't expensive, it is a good car to build up your credit to.
     On the other hand it is has many bad aspects.  The frame of the car is very bendible, the gadgets mess up quicker than most cars.  It is a lego car, you can pull up the dash board, pull out the air vents, and everything basically, I don't personally think that is really safe, also how the car is made,  if you get in a wreck from almost every angle the car is going to be totalled.  The first thing to go on the car is your speed odometer, then the miles you go, then after that all the important things.  The gas mileage sucks, and the more you drive the worse it gets.  I am currently going only about 100 miles on a full tank of gas, and also the car is making very bad sounds, and I keep taking it to many shops and nobody can find out what is wrong.  
     In my opinion I would never recommend anyone buying a Dodge Neon.
