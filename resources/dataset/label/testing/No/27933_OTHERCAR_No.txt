            I have what they call a 1999.5 A4. Basically it has about all the upgrades the 2000 model has. I also opted for the 1.8 turbo as I have 2 with the 2.8 6 cyl.

To start, Audi never left much out for convenience and comfort. Onboard computer, heated seats, mirrors, doors, windshield washers. I love it for a daily driver, especially in bad weather, this thing will walk down my steep driveway and up a huge hill in 2 feet of snow like it was not even there. It is a more sportier model than it's more posh cousins A6 and A8, but for a smaller sedan in the price range, it is really great. It weighs almost as much as a Ford Explorer, yet it is much smaller. Which tells you it is built to last. Galvanized steel body with aluminum make them virtually rust free even after several years.

I like the 6 cyl. because it is smoother than the 4 cyl. turbo. If I had to opt again I would take the 6. They have almost the same MPG, same HP, the only advantage being is the 4 cyl. does not need to water pump and timing belt changed as early as the 6 due to the 6 having the timing belt spin the pump where on the 4 it is independent.

But it does have pep, you just need to step on it or use the Tiptronic Manual mode. It has a slight understeer on corners, but it sticks like glue on almost any surface.

Mileage runs me around 21 city, 28-29 highway, but goes down considerably as you hit the 125 mph mark. Then you will watch it drop to around 14 mpg. Whereas my BMW 6 cyl. is much better on gas with a larger engine.

But the difference being that one has 4x4, the other 2 wheel. I also put her side by side with a VW Passat because the VW owner love to think the cars are the same. Well, after several comparisons in quality of materials and features, he finally resigned to the fact the reason an Audi costs more is because there is much more. 

Fully designed for safety. Some quirks though are the cupholders. Germany never liked the American idea of drinking in a car, and has never been very accommodating to the fact. Beemers are the same way in my opinion. Audi has never resolved an age old issue of placing the center console to where your right leg hits it either. For larger people, this can be somewhat uncomfortable on long drives for tall guys like myself.

Air is ICE cold, heat comes on incredibly fast, even in sub zero weather. But I really waver between this car and my BMW. Both have some fine features and completely different driving styles and personalities. I have a hard time choosing except where I need the power, then the BMW takes the road. When I need a car for really bad weather, the Audi takes it hands down. The Audi also has much better climate control than the BMW, so if ice cold air and almost instant heat are what you need, the Audi cannot be beat.

Cannot go wrong with this car if you are prepared to maintain it. You can keep it for 300k or better and still look and drive new.
