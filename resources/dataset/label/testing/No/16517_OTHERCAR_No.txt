            Just a year out of college in 96, I was so excited to sell my reliable 92 Ford Escort to buy a new Jetta GL. My first new car ever was intended to be the car I paid off in full and drove into the ground. Unfortunately, I believe that if I don't get rid of it soon, it may be the car that drives ME into the ground. Since I got my Jetta I have been plagued with transmission problems--and of course it's always something that no one can figure out at the dealership.

Within the first month of ownership, I was driving on the highway for quite a while when all of a sudden there was no power when I stepped on the gas. Fortunately I was in the slow lane and was able to pull over to shut the car off. When I restarted the car, it worked fine. I took it to the dealership and they couldn't find a problem. The same thing has happened on 6 other occasions that I can recall. What's really freaky is that the car all of a sudden doesn't 'know' what gear to be in. When I look down at the dash, the gear light goes from D to 1 to R to 3 to N etc. It's so dangerous, and yet no one knows what the problem is. This problem only happens after I had been driving for a while.

Another transmission problem: when the car is cold, if I attempt to go anywhere near even a small hill, the car stutters and putt putts its way up the hill. I have come close to getting rear-ended on more than one occasion.

Another transmission complaint: It takes way too long to pick up speed. It's unbearable, especially with other people in the car. The extra weight really seems to stump this Jetta of mine. 

At 24.5 K miles, the radiator fan motor and A/C condenser went at the same time. Luckily for me, the dealer mechanic I went to was so great and called corporate to get a &quot;good faith warranty&quot; for me (because the warranty ran out at 24K). And I only had to pay 10% of the total cost!

Let's see what else.... The windshield wipers just smear the rain around and blur it up.

The heating and cooling systems stink. I mean literally. The first winter I had my car, I thought that I would pass out from the smell of the heat. It's kind of a chemical smell that only gets worse with time. The A/C also smells like an wet clothes that someone left in the washer way too long. Maybe they gave me some old moldy mildewy refurbished parts????

So other than all that the Jetta is okay. I actually loved it before I realized how dangerous my particular car is. I do have friends that have had great Jetta experiences. My uncle has owned a couple and has had excellent luck. Apparently I need to stick with Fords, or maybe I'll just ride my bike.
