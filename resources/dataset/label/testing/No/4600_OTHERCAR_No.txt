            I traded my '92 Buick in for a &quot;97 Park Avenue Ultra in October of 1997 because I was impressed with new package that Buick had put together - one that seemed a little more stylish and technologically improved. Because I purchased it at the end of the model year, and because I had some GM Credit Card dollars, I paid considerably less than the sticker price of $37,000 - but it was still a lot of money and I expected  a lot.
It has many things that I was looking for - a large trunk, plenty of interior room, reasonably good handling, a nice array of gadgets and plenty of power. In short, it is a great luxo-cruiser - especially for long trips. 
Unfortunately, I was not able to resist buying this &quot;first year out&quot; model and I think I suffered through a number of design &quot;learnings&quot; -- unusual grinding sounds from the front suspension, rubbing sounds from the brakes, an electronic &quot;information center&quot; in the dash that went berserk, a gas gauge that failed and a paint job that was cloudy. All these issues were eventually resolved with the support of the dealer, but what a pain!
On the plus side, the car really hauls, it gets surprisingly good gas mileage (up to 30 mpg on a trip), feels safe and it is a very good driver.
Gripes: It seems to attract parking lot dings like flies to #%&amp;, and the optional &quot;Business Console&quot; in the front seat takes up too much room and gets in the way.(And my kids tell me it's an &quot;old person's&quot; car)
I'm enjoying it more now that everything's fixed (?) 
By the way, it looks just like the picture above.
