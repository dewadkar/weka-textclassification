            This is a great product for first time users.  Installation is a snap.  The software is real easy to use.  The only problem is that this sucks up batteries like there going out of style.  Be sure to keep a AC power adapter handy for long periods of use.  Adobe PhotoDelux is fun and easy to use.  This is good for leaning.  You might want to get a more powerful camera for advanced users.  The lack of zoom makes taking pictures a little bit more trickey.  But, the software makes up for it sometimes.<br><br>
