            We bought this camera because the price was right and we didn't know any better.  It was very easy to install and learn how to use.  It is also pretty durable and could withstand being handled by a two year old, and when I was having a problem with the memory card, tech support was extremely helpful and the company sent me a new one for free that was better than the one it came with.

However, this camera eats batteries like they are going out of style.  In just six hours at a wedding and reception I had to change them three times.  The strange thing is, these batteries still work in other electronics, just not in the camera.

Another horrible point is it's speed.  If I wanted to take a picture, I'd have to turn the camera on and hold down the button for about 30 seconds to a minute before it would snap.  Then it would take pictures fine for a few shots, and I would have to repeat holding the button down.  

Finally, the quality of the pictures leaves something to be desired.  Very grainy and require a lot of touching up before being even close to ready to share.
