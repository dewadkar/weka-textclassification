            I purchased the Agfa E-Photo Smile digital camera for my in-laws as a Christmas gift.  It was easy to use, just point and click, we assume it took the pictures.  However, once we hooked the camera up to the computer it would not upload the photos.  Installing the software was simple, we didn't have any trouble with that.  But getting back to trying to upload the photos, the software would not recognize that there was a camera plugged in.  We could not find any information on the Agfa website for troubleshooting this problem and returned it.  I had also recommended this camera to a friend of mine because it was on sale at a local department store and she also had the same problem.  I would not recommend this digital camera to anyone.  <br><br>
