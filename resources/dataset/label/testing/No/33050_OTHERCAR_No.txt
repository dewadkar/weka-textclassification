            We bought our 1993 Voyager used in 1994.  Immediately upon taking it home (over a large mountain range) it started cutting out and chugging.. Thankfully we still had a warranty because the transmission had problems that had to be fixed to the tune of lots of $$$!.  Then in 1997, the timing belt went out.. again a costly fix. And finally, in 1998 the engine blew.We had nothing but problems with this vehicle!  
On the up side, I loved the room ( have 3 young boys and my husband is 6'5&quot; tall) and the front seats were extremely comfortable for long rides. There was a lot of storage for cups, toys,etc. and  it held up inside considering that we really USED that vehicle! I wouldn't buy one of these older models, but I might be tempted to take a dive into a new one!! They're beautiful!<br><br>
