            This will be the first of many reports from the last few months spent looking for a new car,The Nubira was rented for a long weekend drive to Las Vegas. 

I reserved an economy car and was expecting a geo metro but was pleasantly surprised to get find a Daewoo Nubira in the space. It was more on the larger end of a compact car than an economy. It had power windows/door locks and a cd player wow. I drove off happy. Until I got to the freeway. 

At 50 mph it shimmyed a little. Just a slight vibration. By 65 mph it was shaking badly. This car had only 2k miles on it but being a rental it's easy to see that someone abused it. 

So the things that were not a result of prior renters were that the steering wheel when the wheels were dead on straight, the logo on the wheel was pointing 3 oclock. So the wheel was off. And the clock was out, the lighter did not work, one power window did not work, the seats have wheel adjustments like european cars but no where near as easy to use. I could not find a comfortable position. The pickup is on par with a geo metro ( I know because I own one, see my other review ) The interior materials seem cheap as does the seat fabric and padding. 

I had to take it back to the rental agent and get something else. This is dissapointing as I was in the market for a new 4 door sedan and really liked the looks of it but at heart it is still typical Korean car quality: POOR (aka hyundai, kia)<br><br>
