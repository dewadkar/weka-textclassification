            Back in 1997, we purchased a 1993 Ford Taurus Wagon. We purchased the car because we needed a larger car for our family. The car had problems the moment we drove it off the lot. As we were driving down the expressway in our &quot;new&quot; car, the Oxygen sensors went out (meaning the car would stall out going 65MPH). We called the dealership, and they fixed them, assuring us that the car had been very well taken care of, and this was just a strange coincidence. Well, 2 weeks later, the brakes went out, so we got them fixed. Then the head gasket went out. And now the transmission is out in it!!! We have only had this car for a little over 2 years, and we have sunk more money into it than we had to pay for it(even though we had a warranty)!! I will make sure a mechanic checks out the next car I purchase, and I would advice anyone to do the same.
