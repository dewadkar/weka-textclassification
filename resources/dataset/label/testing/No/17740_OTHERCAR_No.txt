            I wrote a review a few months ago about how much I loved my 1994 Saturn, well two weeks in the shop and $1,500 later my epinion has changed somewhat.
In my last review I wrote that Saturns have this pesky little problem with burning oil.  That pesky little problem burned 5 quarts of oil in 3 1/2 months equaling a broken timing chain and bent valves.  I know the oil is suppose to be changed ever 3 months/3,000 miles but the key word is changed.  The oil is not suppose to disappear into thin air after 3 1/2 miles and 2,ooo miles.  The mechanic told me Saturns are infamous for oil problems.  
So my warning to you is - Don't buy a Saturn unless you are going to check the oil every week (as the mechanic says he advises all Saturn owners), don't trust the oil light (mine never felt the need to even wink at me), and buy a Toyota with the extra couple of grand you will have to drop on a new timing chain, valves, pistons.......<br><br>
