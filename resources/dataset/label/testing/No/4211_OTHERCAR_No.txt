               Our Caravan is a piece of #$%^$. We bought this car new in '96 and it has been one problem after another. It has had a cracked front windshield,a major leak, a blown water pump, electrical problems, a crack in the engine block and a blown transmission. 
   This car has had electrical problems from the very start. When stopped at a light, whole electrical system just died on numerous occasions. Sometimes, when starting the car, the windshield wipers would turn on.
   The first major problem was a cracked windshield. We took it to an auto glass shop and they informed us that this was a very common problem with Caravans and Cherokees. 
   The next problem was a mysterious leak. The entire floor of the van got soaked when driving in the rain. We took it into the Dodge dealer and they were not able to locate the leak. We had to strip out the whole interior ourselves and finally located a huge hole on the right rear fender. We patched it up ourselves. 
   The next problem that we encountered was the blown water pump. We had this replaced at the dealer. 
   The biggest problem was the transmission. It failed at about 50,000 miles. We took it to a transmission shop and he said that this was very common problem for the Caravan and Ram pickups. 
   I will never buy another Dodge product again.
