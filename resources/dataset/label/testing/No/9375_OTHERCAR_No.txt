<TEXT>
            I own a 1996 Toyota Tercel, 2-door, stick-shift. Economically, this car makes sense. Toyotas are known for their dependability and the price, approximately 8k, was right. However, you get what you pay for. This car is extremely low to the ground and the bottom rubs on almost anything. Going over speed bumps at more than 3 MPH is not advised. Also, be aware of potholes, as this car virtually has no shocks. I understand that driving a strip version is different, but I literally feel as if I am riding in a Flintstones car. On the brighter side, it has tremendous miles per gallon, and a nice sporty zip to it. Just realize that you are taking your life into your own hands when you cruise around in this baby. Get used to being invisible to most other drivers and you will have an easier time with this puppy than I did.<br><br>
