            I own a 1998 Jimmy SLT, which is almost identical to the 1999 Jimmy SLT. I've owned it for 15 months, and I bought it new. It has 10,600 miles on it. It had a leak near the oil filter, from the day I bought it, and it took the GMC dealer 6 tries before it was fixed. Finally, it was fixed. All they had to do was change the part that holds the oil filter, but for some reason were reluctant to do so, until I threatened them with the California lemon law. Finally, no oil leak.
I had a problem with the engine running rough. I took it to the dealer, and was told that it was the California-purchased gas. Two days later, one bottle of Chevron Techron fuel additive later, and it was running again. Two weeks before the problem, we received a letter from GMC that said that the fuel injectors were fouling up, and General Motors was going to warrantee them for 10 years... but the vehicle wasn't being recalled. The notice was just a notice. The dealer blamed my problem on &quot;cheap&quot; gas.
The turning radius of the Jimmy stinks. It handles like a Mack truck. Acceleration also stinks. It does fine after 50 MPH, but don't try to do 0-60 in under 12 seconds.
The Jimmy rides better than any 4x4 I've ever been in. The interior is luxurious, the leather seats very comfortable, and well designed, but the quality and ride don't justify a purchase. I wouldn't ever buy another one, and definitely would not recommend anyone buying one, either. Go for a Toyota 4Runner and forego all the problems. 
I finally got all the problems corrected, and am thinking of selling it. I'm disgusted with the GMC mechanics, as well as the vehicle itself.
In March 2000, I found a warped gasket around the windshield. This, even after I've had the Jimmy garaged since I bought it. The dealer tried to glue the gasket, but the Customer Service Rep. felt sorry for me and had the whole gasket replaced....Now my wife tells me that the Jimmy's running rough again. I've been using Chevron gas, as the dealer recommended. I have no idea when all the grief will end!
Epinions won't let you choose more than &quot;SEVERAL VISITS TO THE SHOP PER YEAR&quot; They obviously have never owned a GMC JIMMY!!
I've already cost GM a sale. I persuaded my insurance agent, who was planning to purchase a Jimmy, to buy a 4Runner. I will continue to warn anyone who will listen about the Jimmy.
ADDENDUM: In June of 2000 my grief ended. I sold this lemon to another GMC dealer and bought a 2000 4Runner.  
MORAL OF THE STORY: Don't trust an automaker (GM) who won't recall a vehicle with design problems. Avoid the problem by buying a 4Runner.    GM cost me a bundle. I should have bought a Toyota to begin with.<br><br>
