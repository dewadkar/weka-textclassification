            Well let's see.  What can I say about this truck?  I say it sux.  For the past 8 months I have had nothing but trouble with this truck.  Oh it's a beauty and all, but the performance lacks a lot to be desired.

You know, people say, don't judge a book by its cover, and in this case it's true.  This truck is an impressive site to behold when you are passing it down the interstate at about 75 miles an hour, but that would be about it.

We purchased this truck in April of 1999 and at the beginning it ran as beautifully as it looked, but about 2 months after that it started to show its true colors.

We have had to have the breaks fixed at least twice...so far, and the front end had to be realigned (they wore out before the tires did), plus we noticed a leak in the floor board of the driver's side.

Now, I tell you....is this a truck that you would want just because it looked good? If you really want a good looking vehicle, please do extensive researching on it before you purchase it because honestly...LOOKS ARE NOT EVERYTHING.<br><br>
