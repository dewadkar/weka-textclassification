            I bought my Kia new and shiny off the showroom floor.  I loved the affordability, the size, and the newness of it.  What a mistake!  While the Kia Sportage performs well off road, and zips around quite nicely in town and on the highway, it spent a huge amount of time in the dealer's shop being repaired during the 2 years that I owned it.  It developed mystery problems that were very difficult to diagnose.  The warranty work took over 2 months of the time I owned the vehicle- time which they gave me a Camry to drive while they puzzled over why my rig sounded like a lawnmower (with as much power!).  I really fell in love with the reliable Camry!  

The Kia also had a very difficult to use rear window/door assembly.  In order to open the rear tailgate, you had to pull a tire release switch in the driver's area, walk back and reach around under the usually grimy spare tire to pull the release switch, then swing open the spare.  At this point, if you were on any type of a slope, you had to manhandle the tire open all the way, remove the locking pin from the backside of the tire, and insert it into the hinge area to keep the tire from smacking you.  Now you would be ready to use your key to open the lock on the back of tailgate.  Yikes!  

I am very happy to report that I sold my vehicle 18 months ago.  I am very happy in my new Camry!<br><br>
