            Well, I test drove a few SUV's. At that time,I was pregnant.  This truck drove pretty smooth compared to the other three SUV's I test drove. It drove smooth at about 60 miles per hour. I liked the way this truck drove like a car. 
Then, the snow fell in the winter, and this truck was very slippery. You definetely have to use the four-wheel-drive.  Actually, it is also very slippery on wet pavements.  
It is very deceiving when you look inside this truck.  I had my baby, and of course, I have an infant car seat installed in the back of the truck. The truck seemed roomy at first, before I put a car seat in there. Now it is totally CRAMPED! I have a teenager whom I sometimes drive around along with her friends. Since the infant-car seat is in the back, there is only room for one friend back there. My husband dislikes this truck too, because his head keeps hitting inside the top of the truck.  
I think that young, single people may like this truck. It's a fun truck. It isn't serious enough for hauling family members around.  This truck is made for single people, who do not have to use any infant or child safety car seat in the back. Otherwise, the only room you will have in the back seat is for one person and one car seat; or two people and NO car seat. Yes, three people can sit in the back seat, but it will be very cramped.
