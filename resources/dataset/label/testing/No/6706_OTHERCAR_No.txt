            The Chevy Lumina is the perfect grandpa car:

1. It can't go fast even if you were Jeff Gordon.  It doesn't have a tachometer so you can't tell the engine's running at 4000rpm doing the speed limit on the highway.

2.  The steering is floaty.  Good for grandpa who likes to take corners nice and slowly but pathetic in the wind/on rougher pavement, feels like the car's not touching the road.  (But at least the ride is moderately smooth)

3.   Front seats are pathetic.  No support for the lower back and pretty low and close to the floor.  Similar to Chevy Ventures whose seats are feel like they are 6 inches off the ground.

4.  The "multi-function" knob:  Wipers on/off, Wiper spray, Hi-beam headlights, turn left, turn right, cruise on/off/resume, set cruise.  Too complicated with 7 functions on 1 little handle. Very difficult to adjust cruise at night with out the light on.  

5. My Walkman has more power than the stereo.  And my Walkman also manages to split the sound about 50/50 between my left ear and my right, which the Lumina fails miserably at.

6. Worse gas mileage than you would expect for a car with such little power.  Old-school GM "big, low-tech" 3.4L V-6 drinks gas like a powerful V-6, delivers okay lower-end torque but not much else.

7.  LOOKS UGLY!  Archetype of plain.  Loses resale value because it has so little style, no one wants it.  Except grandpas.  And reliability etc. is no better than any other car. 

Consider a Chrysler Intrepid.  You can pick up a used 97 with 40,000km for about 14 grand Canadian.  220hp 3.5L V-6, looks way better, drives with confidence, and is bigger and more comfortable.  Maybe a little less relaible but you won't go back.
