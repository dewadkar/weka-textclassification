            My wife and I have a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am, and I'm not really sure how I feel about it.  I *do* know that I wouldn't buy another one.  The car has been a good performer, and hasn't needed any major work.  All we've done is changed the oil on schedule, changed the brake pads, and rotated the tires.

The car still even looks new... there are absolutely no signs of wear, rust, or anything else like that on the body.  The engine itself shows signs of minor corrosion that is quite normal for cars driven in New England.  The four cylinder engine is nothing amazing, but it pulls us along where we need to go.  For some reason, the car seems optimized for cruising at 65-70mph.

The inside of the car isn't the best in design and quality.  At least two air vents have fallen off... needing re-gluing or re-attaching to get them back in place.  And there is a *persistent* annoying squeak coming from the middle of the dash that has prompted us to wedge napkins between the windshield and dash in order to quiet it.  This squeak has remained consistent for 5 years!

The door locks are automatic, and they have given us no problem whatsoever.  I have one gripe that drives me nuts with this car.  The interior light is completely automatic... you can't turn it off when you want to.  When I get into a car at night in the middle of a dark parking lot, the last thing I want is my interior light to pop on nice and bright, illuminating to the world what I am doing inside my car.  The light does not extinguish until you put the key in the ignition and start the car.  It just bugs the hell out of me.

Nitpicking aside, the Grand Am is not a bad car.  It's given 5 years of reliable service so far, with no major problems or incidents.  I certainly don't mind owning one, but I don't think I would recommend it to a friend.<br><br>
