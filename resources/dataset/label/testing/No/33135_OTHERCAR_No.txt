            I went to test drive a Malibu this week. First, they are nothing like the old Malibus of yesertyear. :-) A sad fact indeed. All good things must end. Sigh....

However, This car is a nice. Not as smooth as some, but okay for the money. Which is a pretty good price for a new car. 

I was very impressed with the trunk size. Very large and roomy. Also the back seats lay down. A big plus, I feel. I always try to look for a number of ways something will be useful to me.

I would recommend this car. This car is perfect for a first time buyer with a family. Although made to seat 5. If you have children and plan to ever travel in this car, I would say 4 people. Can't have the kids touching each other :-) As we all know. 

If I was in the market for a small car. This would be one I would think very hard about.<br><br>
