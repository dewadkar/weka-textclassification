            I've been in the market for a new Sports utility vehicle and have looked at most.  My wife was really impressed with the look of the Xterra so we went and did the test drive and evaluation of the car.  I was very disappointed, seems they didn't think too much about several item in the vehicle they just sort of threw it in.  The first Item i had a problem with was the sun roof, it cant be opened even tilted open to allow air circulation because they have placed a hard plastic grill over it for the purpose of carrying luggage in the front roof rack.  

Second item I Had a big problem with was the rear seat, in order to fold it down to get anything in the back you have to remove the bottom of the seat completely it doesn't even fit in between the front and folded down portion of the rear seat, so that means you have to put it on the roof, which i suppose is ok as long as its not raining.  

With vehicle like the Pathfinder which I have owned in the past, its a shame to see a new vehicle like the Xterra take a step backwards when the overall concept is a decent one, i hope Nissan makes some changes because with some tweaks and with an interior that doesn't look and feel so cheap it could become a decent vehicle however this years model is a Thumbs down in my opinion.  Although I didn't purchase the vehicle i did have it for the day to see if its what we really wanted, I'm glad I did this because it proved to me it wasn't I strongly recommend you do the same before taking one home for 5 years.<br><br>
