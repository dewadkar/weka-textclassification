            When my wife and I bought our 19972 Saturn SL2 in late 1996, I thought we were getting a really good car. It was fully loaded (for a Saturn) and seemed like a nice small car. Boy, was I wrong! At first it was OK, but after 4 years, I have really grown to dislike this car. I currently have 49,000 miles on the car, but it feels more like 149,000. I have had the car completely checked from one end to the other by the Saturn dealer and they state that the car is working within specifications. I have had it tuned up, fuel injectors cleaned, all filters replaced, spark plug wires, transmission checked, everything I can think of, but it still doesn't help. First, power from the engine has dropped dramatically. In the beginning, the car was quick, not fast, but definitely quick. Now it can barely get out of its own way. The car rattles excessively and feels like it is loose. I have to admit that the plastic body panels have been nice since a lot of people like to hit your car with their doors, so we don't have any dents, although the paint is scuffed in places. Also, the trade-in value has dropped dramatically. I have gotten 3 offers (one from the Saturn dealer) that ranged from $6,000 to $7,000 and the car is in good shape on the inside and outside. So that is another gripe. I am definitely not going to buy another Saturn if this is how they really are. Time to look at a Toyota or Honda.<br><br>
