            Perhaps no other car proclaims rental more than an appliance white base model Chevrolet Calvalier. I just spent the past week in a rented 2000 Calvalier and found the experience to be acceptable. No one contemplating the purchase of a new Calvalier should delude themselves. The car offers basic transportation with the security of a new car warranty but little else. 

First the good points. The styling,a handsome composition of curves is hardly sexy but better to my eyes than other plain jane sedans like the Corolla. The interior is fairly roomy for a compact and while it took a while to find a good driving position once obtained I found the driving position and seat comfort to be good. Two criticisms , the headrests are completely ineffective and the seat is mounted a bit low. Shorter drivers may have problems seeing out of the car despite its glassy greenhouse.

The Calvalier's worst point is it's missed potential. With the Calvalier Chevrolet has proven it can build a long term reliable car. Unfortunately it has made that car a penalty box. The engine is coarse to a fault transmitting constant vibration straight through to the driver. Even during modest acceleration ( I do not drive hard) the engine sounds like its being strangled. The ride is well controlled but handling is marred by body roll. The car also displayed quite a bit of torque steer, something most manufacturers of front wheel drive cars managed to engineer out a long time ago. Brakes were marginal. The interior is comprised of hard cheap feeling plastics in the most depressing shade of gray I have ever seen. 

Sitting at a long traffic light on an early fall afternoon listening to an NPR report on Ralph Nader and news of student protests it suddenly dawned on me what car the Calvalier most reminded me of. My grandfathers 1971 Hornet. Like the Calvalier that car was plain , crude, and reliable. I thank the Calvalier for a few moments of childhood seventies nostalgia but I know I could not have a long term relationship with this car.

Other manufacturers have raised the bar far beyond what the Calvalier is capable of achieving. The Neon is equally crude but much sportier. The Corolla is equally boring but a much much better car for about the same $13,000-$14,000. Even Ford has hit a home run with the excellent Focus which along with the Honda Civic is probably the best car in this price range.

Having known lots of folks who have put serious mileage on trusty old Calvaliers I am confident these cars last a long time. Take a look around and you'll see thousands of these cars being driven by working people who depend on them for cheap reliable transportation. As for that it seems to me that the Calvalier makes much more sense as a used car when it will cost a third less than its more desirable rivals. Buy a Calvalier confident it will last forever but know you will wish it wouldn't.
