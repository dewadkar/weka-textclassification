            This camera has many good features. It has only a few important down sides which I will mention here at the beginning.

1-It's bulky
2-The CD's have to be Sony 8mm CD's!
3-The camera does not have buffer memory. This means that if you take a picture, you have to sometimes wait for it to write it to disk which takes 1 or 2 seconds but it can sometimes be a 10 second wait!
4-The software that came with the camera did not work with Windows XP as advertised requiring a patch from Sony which was difficult to find.

As for the up side
The Sony Mavica CD-200 offers many great features.
Let's start off with some basics.
It has a 27mm Filter Thread, that will accept most consumer Sony Camcorder Lenses. A wide angle lens is a good idea. Although don't expect to get good flash photos with the lens on as the lens blocks the pop up flash so you will get a big shadowed out part of the picture if you use a lens.

The flash pops up out of the cameras top when you want to take a flash picture. If  you ever hear the words "Please no flash photography" then a good thing is that you can put your finger over the flash compartment so that it won't pop up by mistake. It has three flash settings "low, standard, and bright" which are helpfull. If you set the camera in the standard mode it will take care of almost everything for you.

The camera has many many features and modes which will confuse most, I suggest you stick to the Auto camera mode. It's simple, just point and click and it handles all the technical stuff by itself. Like any $10 camera.

For the Pro's this camera has many good features. It can take slow shutter pictures. I've taken up to 8second exposures and gotten 'brighter than the eye can see' photos of the city at night. This requires a tripod or hard surface to place the camera on. As for taking pictures of the night sky have only gotten tiny 1 pixel white dots (stars) which aren't worth much. You won't see anything by getting 8second exposures of the night sky unless it's cloudy, then you'll get bright clouds in the picture.

The camera can take about 128 pictures on one Rewriteable 8mm CD you can get at any Electronics store. I haven't had the need to buy more CD's. 128 pictures is more than enough for anyone.

The camera can be almost entirely manually driven. You can set the exposure, Fstops, focus, aperture, flash level, and all that other good stuff. For novices the Auto mode is the best. The camera does not take good pictures at night. You have to learn how to slow the shutter down and turn on the flash to get clear pictures. A steady hand also helps and you will get at least 1 blurry picture for every two you take at night.

The camera has a 6x zoom which is somewhat helpful in getting you closer to subjects and getting a telephoto effect (common in professional photography). It's better than 3x but I prefer to just take wide angle pictures most of the time.

The camera can also take tiny and short MPEG clips with audio. They are tiny and go at about 1 or 2 frames per second. That means they are jittery, full of mpeg compression chunks, and only worth for showing friends what things looked like. The video is not much better than either a bad webcam or a bad cellphone camera.

Also one thing that has shown up with my camera is that the button to take the picture jams 1 out of ever 40 pictures. The plastic becomes trapped in the camera body and you have to flick it out with your finger nail. This is a serious problem. You don't want to miss a great photo oportunity with a celebrity because the button jammed.

And roughly every 1 out of 200 pictures the camera freezes in one way or another and you have to remove the battery to get it to start over.

The battery is a Sony info-Lithium M battery which you can just leave in the camera. Whenever you plug the camera into the adapter that comes with it, it will charge the battery by itself. This camera is NOT a battery hog. Like most good Sony cameras and camcorders you will find that it gives you what the package says, good long battery time. The batteries are also compatible with many other sony cameras. My Sony Mavica CD-200 shares it's batteries with an older Sony TRV-10 camcorder I have, but not with the Sony VX-2000

An error in the camera is that when you press the picture button to take a picture, here's what the camera does:

-Press picture button
-Viewscreen goes black for 1 second
-picture is taken during previous 1 second
-screen shows picture while it says "saving"
-red light stays on till picture has been saved. Buttons do not work until red light goes out. Sometimes red light stays on for 2 to 20 seconds which is bad.

Now the problem with this is that you can only take one picture at a time. Which is slow. 1 picture every 3 seconds if you're lucky. That and the camera shows black during the most crucial moment in photography, when the picture is actually being taken. This makes for many misses, you might be taking a picture of a fast moving object and miss it during the black out period. A huge error in the programing of the camera.

This camera is like a jeep, if you've learned to get all the kinks out then you'll accept it since it does what you want it to do most of the time. It's also easier to keep this "jeep" camera than to take a chance on another camera which might not do all that you want it to do.
