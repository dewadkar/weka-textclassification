            The Oldsmobile Bravada is one of the classiest sport utilities on the market.  The sheer visual appeal puts this vehicle in the category of original luxury SUV.  Credit is due to Oldsmobile for making traditional options standard on the Bravada.  The all power, heated leather seats can rival those of any luxury vehicle around.  The body lines also give this vehicle the edge of not having the standard boxy design so often noticeable with SUV's.

The price tag may be a little steep for a vehicle whose original purpose was for functionality.  Paying roughly $ 33,000.00 makes a 4x4 outing seem senseless.  I personally feel that this is a good compromise between a luxury sedan and a sturdy truck.

This particular vehicle handles like a car.  One does not feel as if they are driving a truck, which is especially helpful when taking curves and passing on the highway.  I have always felt safe in the Bravada.

I was a little disappointed at the recurring transmission problems I encountered.  The Bravada was bought new, right off of the showroom in February 1998.  Transmission problems began at approximately 4 months / 8,000 miles.  This continued to be a source of concern throughout the life of ownership.  The transmission ended up being overhauled 4 times between Feb. 1998 and April 2000.  I highly doubt that this will make the vehicle worth anything on the secondary market.

Despite the engine problems, which may be a fluke, the Bravada remains a good SUV choice.  I feel that it is a logical choice when comparing high end SUV's.<br><br>
