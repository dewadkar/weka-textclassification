            I bought a 1999 Dodge Intrepid.  Now I decided I wanted to buy a 2000 Dodge Intrepid. So I went to Brandon Dodge to make a deal..  My car cost $21,000. new and they offered me $10,500. on a trade-in for a 2000.  I told the guy he was insulting my intelligence and insulting the Intrepid.  He was telling me that my car lost 50% of it's value in one year.  Crasy?????????  I like the looks of the Intrepid, it's easy to drive and makes me feel special.  But if you don't want to lose $10,000 in one year then don't buy the Intrepid.  <br><br>
