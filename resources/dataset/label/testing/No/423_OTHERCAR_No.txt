            When I first leased my used 96 Lexus ES300, I felt extreme pride in my ability to take such a leap from my Toyota to a Lexus.  I loved driving my car.  There was about 48,000 on it, as I got it off another lease and the car appeared to be in perfect condition.  I loved driving this car.  It was quiet, smooth and extremely comfortable.  It had all the amenities I was looking for with the exception of heated seats, but I figured I could live without that.  The stereo system is excellent and the car gave me ability to really enjoy driving.

However, as the car has gotten older, I find it wears down a lot faster than my Toyota did.  Strange noises started happening and I found that my car was in the dealership more than I had it and I was using loaners more than my own car.  I am not really pleased with Lexus service either (not at my particular dealer at least).  They treated me with little respect and I often left feeling mistreated and taken advantage of.  My car wasn't performing the way it was supposed to.  It's a Lexus and I expected Lexus quality.

The car itself looks nice.  The interior is comfortable and has proven safe.  However, like I said, the car doesn't wear well.  It seems to fall apart easily and you can't beat it up too much.  I wouldn't suggest buying any used car from Lexus if it is over 3 years by the time you get to it.  I will never lease or buy used again.
