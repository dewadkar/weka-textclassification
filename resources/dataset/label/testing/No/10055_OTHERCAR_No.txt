            My wife needed a dependable vehicle for work!  Previously drove a small Subaru, and I wanted something sporty looking, larger and more comfortable for road trips.  We looked at quite a few vehicles Ie. Toyota Camary, BMWs, Dodge Intrepids and several other Chrysler products.
After several weeks of browsing through various dealerships and showrooms in Charlotte, NC,we located a 94 Diamante with 6,000 original miles at what seemed like a very good price.  The car was in excellent shape.
My wife, the only driver, religiously has all required services performed on the car.
When the car reached 68,000 miles (out of warranty), we started seeing puffs of white smoke coming out of the exhaust.  We took the vehicle to the Mitsubishi Dealership and were informed by the service manager that this is a known defect in the Diamante, requiring the engine to be rebuilt at a cost of around $4500.001
I have seen quite a few of the 94 Diamantes on the road and some actually look like the exhaust of an old fashioned Steam Locomotive!  My question is why can a manufacturer be permitted to build a Disposable Engine during a time when we are focussing so heavily on Pollution Prevention and Waste Minimization?
Mitsubishi America and Japan both refuse to comment favorably on this situation---Look Out Car Buyer!
