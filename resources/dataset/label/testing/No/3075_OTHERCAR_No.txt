            So i'm at the dealership and I see this sleek, beautiful light silver car.  I test drive it and absolutely love it.  The 3.5L engine looks awesome.  It is roomy and all my friends love it.   Until...

Two weeks afer I bought it I get in and start driving.  But my transmission is not shifting.  I look down and my speedometer isn't working.  I take it to the chrysler dealership where the used car place told me to take it (It is one of Chryslers so-called "5 star" dealerships).  They say I need a new output speed sensor.  Since the dealership i bought it from paid for it i had no problem.  Just a week later i was driving down the highway and it went out again.  Since it intermittently goes out I couldn't get it back to the dealership until about 6 months later.  They didn't charge me for the part but they did for the labor.  Just 5 days later, it goes out for the THIRD time!  I take it back and they say it isn't the sensor this time, it's the wire harness.  They also tell me that I need a tune-up and an intake manifold gasket and give me an absolutely outrageous estimate for it ($700).  I'm not too quick to believe them because just 5 days earlier that same dealership told me different things were wrong with my car.  I got it at 62,000 miles and the transmission had already been replaced (probably why the previous owner got rid of it). I've also have to get the air conditioner recharged once a year because of Chrysler's design flaw.

This company is plaqued with fauly products and dishonest dealerships.  I will never buy a Chrysler again and don't recommend one to anyone else.


UPDATE 09/07/2002:
Well just to update my nightmare with this car.  I still have it, thanks to it depreciating faster than I can pay it off.  My output speed sensor went out again this past  January.  This dealership tried to charge me $270 to fix the control unit.  I negotiated a bit because I was NOT about to pay them because they couldn't figure out what the problem was in the first place.  I got the last repair done for $30.  Two days later, I was pulled over.  My speedometer read 70 (the speed limit was 70) so I asked the officer how fast his radar said I went. "86 miles per hour" he replied.  After taking it to an honest mechanic, he told me that the dealership put in the incorrect speed sensor, and it was now impossible to determine the correct one I needed, since Chrysler apparently liked to change parts for the same car several times a year back then (i.e. a 1996 Intrepid made in January won't have the same speed sensor as a 1996 Intrepid made in June).  Now I am stuck with a speedometer that is over 16 MPH off on the freeway.  However, it has at least worked and for that i'm thankful.

As far as the intake gasket, I found another honest mechanic who fixed it for $180.

This summer I was sitting at a light near Detroit and my hood starting blowing smoke everywhere.  After it was look at my mechanic told me the Air Conditioner was no good and needed another $800 unit.  It would also br another $700 to fix the factory design flaw that makes the unit lose its fluid every year.  I decided to live without Air Conditioning.

Right now i'm experiencing what I believe to be a "Calm before the storm."  It has been 4 months since my last major repair and the car has been giving me no problems.  My advice is to avoid all '97 and below Intrepids.  The older it is, the worse these problems seem to be.

UPDATE 10/09/2003:
The calm before the storm has ended.  Just last week I was driving merrily along my way.  I looked down and the car was overheating.  OH NO!  I parked it as soon as possible and popped the hood.  Anti-freeze was spilling out everywhere.  I took it to a shop the next morning.  It turns out that the water pumps go out on these engines at the drop of a hat.  Of course, in addition to using what was probably the cheapest, poorest quality water pump they could find, Mitsubishi had the wonderful foresight to make it so one has to take half of the engine apart in order to even get the water pump.  These geniouses also had the brilliant idea of wrapping the $100 timing belt around it, so it would have to be replaced as well.  I walked out of that shop over $700 poorer, which was all the money I had saved up from working overtime.  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS CAR

UPDATE 11/13/2003:
I went grocery shopping one night and I go to start up the car after I finish.  The engine won't turn over.  After a huge fiasco with my insurance and a tow truck, I find out that I need a new starter.  No problem, it's only $270.
