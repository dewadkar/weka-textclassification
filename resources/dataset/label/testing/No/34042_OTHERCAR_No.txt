            This car is a lemon and a half!  Or at least the one we purchased was!  

Do you like your mechanic?  I hope so because if you buy this car you are going to be seeing him a lot!  We purchased this car used in 1994.  I don't think I have enough time to list the problems we had with it.  It was definately a lemon!  

First of all, the brake shoes had to be replaced about every other month.  Finally we replaced the entire brake system costing about 700$.  Bye bye tax return!  

Then we had other small problems.  Alternator, battery, radio quit working, etc.  Then the engine burnt up!  Evidently the car ran out of oil and the oil light never signaled.  So we had to pay 900$ to replace the engine.  More little problems for the next year or so.  Then the timing chain broke!  Another 700$ problem.  Finally the last straw, something with the pistons.  It was either get another engine AGAIN or get rid of the car.  So we sold it to a junk yard for 80$.  

Original price on the car was about $8,000.  We put about $5,000 dollars worth of car into it.  Needless to say, resale value was not very good at $80.  

One good thing about it, it had rear window defrost.  That came in handy when it broke down in the middle of January and it was 15 degrees outside.  It keep our hands warm as we were pushing it at least!

Maybe it was an abused car before we got it, maybe we didn't care for it well enough, but I know I will NEVER even consider purchasing one again.<br><br>
