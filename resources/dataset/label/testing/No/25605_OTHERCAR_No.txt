            When I saw my Saab I fell in love with it.  Having always driven older used cars through high school and university, I was dreaming of the day when I could get in my car and really enjoy a driving experience, and the comfort of knowing that I spent the money required to get a safe, reliable car that would stand me in good stead.  

Unfortunately, I chose to spend a large amount on a lemon, but it's the company's stance on the matter that really makes me feel not only dissatisfied but degraded because of my purchase.

I'll list the problems I have had with the vehicle along with the company's reaction to the problems.  

The car was delivered to me with a small scratch on the driver's side passenger door.  I was told it would be buffed out and re-painted later.  It never has been, even though I have asked the dealership twice to take care of it.

After owning the car for a month, the driver's side front suspension developed a loud whining squeak that sounded every time I drove over any small obstruction- like a curb ramp or speed-bump.  It did not seem to effect performance, but I was worried by the fact that my brand new car was sounding like it was about five years old.  The problem was fixed only on the third time I returned it to the shop for the same complaint.  I eventually had to take a mechanic in the car with me on a drive during my third visit and make him listen to the sound as I drove over a speedbump.  On the previous two visits the car was returned to me in good faith with the false claim of the fault being repaired.     

The passenger side rear door was always coming loose, and I had to keep tightening the door bolts with my fingers.  I did not want to bolt the door down myself, for fear of not aligning the mounts properly.  When I took the car in for this, they used lock-tight on the bolts and mis-aligned the door just as I feared I would do myself.  It now requires a harsh upward yank on the handle to "pop" open the door- I mentioned that this was not how the door was designed, and was told by my dealership that I shouldn't worry about it.

The car broke down (with smoke pouring out of the hood) shortly after that, and was in the shop for more than a month.  When the car was returned to me, the steering system had air in it, and had a horrible grinding noise in it when I turned the wheel to the right.  I returned the car.  They kept it for another week.  They returned it to me with the same problem (the obvious grinding) unrepaired.  I again got a mechanic myself and pointed out that I was very tired of being delivered the car in good faith, when in fact, repairs had not been effected.  They kept the car for another week, and when it was returned to me, the steering was better, but still is not as it was when purchased- there is still a slight "jump" in the steering.

After seven months of waiting for the paint to harden, I began using power-wash nozzles on the car.  A large patch of paint washed right off the front of the car below the grill.  It peeled right off like wall-paper.  The dealership had the car re-painted, but they got the color wrong.  It was close, but a few shades too light.  It took six months of almost constant badgering from myself and friends to get the dealership to pay for the color correction.  

The front seat bottoms on the car became loose, and would lift up right off of the seat frames.  I took the car back to the shop many times over the course of about eighteen months before that fault was finally fixed.

I moved to California, and during the drive down to the bay area where I now live, my driver's side turning light assembly fell right off the car.  When I took the car to a California dealership to have it fixed, they asked me if I had been in an accident.  I said no, and asked them to look at the car for damage.  The representative returned to me and told me that they could find no collision damage, and that the repair would be under warranty.  A business day later, when the repair was effected, I was told that I would have to pay for it because I could not prove that I had not been in an accident.  I paid out of shock.

The SID electronic display was defective and needed to be replaced.

My manual climate control air direction knob broke off inside the dash of the car.  I took it to the dealer and they repaired it.  It broke again about two months later.  I was required to be in the same city as the Saab dealership/garage on a Friday, and called the dealership to make an appointment with them to drop the car off to get the knob repaired again.  I was denied a loaner car because the dealer stated that I had purposefully set my other appointments up in order to get a loaner car for a extended period of time (the weekend).  This was not true, my appointments were at the University of San Jose, and I had no control over when I could see the administrator I needed to.  I tried to explain this to the manager of the dealership, and was accused of "abusing the system" by the manager, and was made to pay for my loaner car while they repaired the knob they had previously fixed two months ago for the same fault.      

***update during draft***
The same climate control knob broke today, Nov 1, 2001.
I am dreading the upcoming ordeal, in fact I have chosen to live with the broken part until now, March 17, 2002 because dealing with Saab has become so unpleasant.

During my second year of owning the car, the computer developed a fault, and only three cylinders were firing.  I drove the car for two weeks with an obvious lack of power before I could get it into the garage.  When it was repaired, all that was done was the replacement of the car's computer.  The car had definitely lost some power from running off of three out of four cylinders.  When I asked about what could be done about this damage, I was told that the dealer was not going to look into it.

Lately, my driver's side window fell forward into the door as I lowered it, I tilted it back into position by hand and rolled the window back up!  Now when I try to roll down that driver's side window, it always falls, tilting into the door and it usually takes a good fifteen minutes to re-align the window.

The car is experiencing massive power loss once again, and I'm about to take it into the shop, though I an afraid to drive it on the highway, I may simply have it towed back to San Jose for yet another repair.

I began calling both Saab Canada and Saab USA after the incident with the turning signal.  I had had enough.  I felt that no reasonable individual could expect such poor mechanical performance from a Saab, a car touted as not only safe, but dependable.  I wanted a new Saab, because I still believed in the product, and understood that sometimes, certain cars can be "Monday Models".  I felt that because Saab had been firm on their price for the car, and unwilling to bargain, that they should be up to providing a car that worked, one that gives one peace of mind, rather than a constant source of stress.  I had paid full price for a terrible car, and it wasn't getting any better.  

I have been stone-walled, refused service, hung-up on, and fed conflict-resolution lines, by various personal in the corporation, and have slowly worked my way up through the echelon, trying to get some response besides, "We have reviewed your claim, and Saab will not buy back your car at this time."  Upon getting this answer from the head of the legal affairs department, I asked what could be done.  The reply was "At this point, I don't know what can be done beyond releasing you from the vehicle."  I mentioned that 'releasing' was a good choice of words.  I mentioned that I was still very unsatisfied with my purchase.  The reply was "We at Saab try to do everything we can to ensure customer satisfaction."  I asked, "What have you done for me?"  The reply from the head of the legal affairs department at Saab USA was: "Nothing."

This inspired me to begin contacting the next person in the chain of command.  It took two months of calling and leaving messages before I realized that I would not be getting any reply from the next individual in line.  This was when I was being hung up on, etc.  

I finally got the name of the Customer Service Manager for North America.  He was kind enough to call me back promptly after I left a message on his voice mail, and during our conversation he gave me two pieces of advice.  
1. I should sell the car, as it sounded to him as though it was not working out for me.
2. According to him, the Customer Service Manager for Saab USA, I shouldn't tell anyone about the car's bad history when I go to sell it.  He said that I might have trouble getting rid of it if I did.

He seemed to feel that after owning the car for almost three years I should feel satisfied.  He said that I had gotten a reasonable amount of use from the vehicle.  Saab's customer loyalty program is to offer one thousand five hundred dollars to a repeat buyer.  This gentleman was kind enough to increase that figure by five hundred dollars, for all my trouble. 

I asked for the name of his supervisor, who turned out to be the president of Saab USA.  I have received two calls back from Dan Chasins' secretary, telling me that no further offer is forthcoming, that nothing else will be done about my car, and to please stop calling Mr. Chasins.

After all of this, I hope that I can warn others to stay clear of this company.  It is obvious that they do not care about customer satisfaction, and if I knew then what I know now, I would never have wasted my money on the ridiculously unreliable Saab.
