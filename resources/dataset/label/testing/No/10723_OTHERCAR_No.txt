            I had the Saab 9-3 as a service loaner for two days, during which I drove it about 100 miles.

I was impressed with the handling.  I believe this to be the car's best feature.  The car's steering is communicative and nicely weighted, and very quick.  All told, I felt like I was driving a sports car.  The brakes could stop on a dime.

However, the car also rode like a sports car.  I thought the ride was stiff, although it was steadier on the highway than the car it replaced.  On secondary roads, the car rode busily, much like the previous model.  At least the car was reasonably quiet inside.

The interior seemed nicely finished, but some of the controls are not as obvious as they should be.  Take, for instance, the steering wheel adjustment lever, located well under the steering wheel, recessed where one would have to pull it out.  When I first tried to work the adjustment lever, the plastic housing for it fell off.  I was able to replace it.  When I released the flush-mounted parking brake, I pinched my fingers.

The lever which controls the wipers and washers switches upward, not downward, as it does in most cars.  The radio controls are hard to work, at first.  

The rear seat has no more room than the previous model.  Also, the head restraints need to be adjusted such that rear passengers don't have to slouch forward.

I think this Saab probably fits well in its category.  Its category consists of cars such as the Volvo S60, the Mercedes Benz C-class, the BMW 3 series, the Audi A4, the Lincoln LS, the Lexus IS 300 and the Infiniti G35.  All of these cars feel snug inside, and so does the Saab.  None of the above cars is a good value.

The Saab 9-3 falls short of my expectations.  With all the talk about a car built around the driver, I fully expected a scaled down version of the excellent Saab 9-5.

Those looking  for a drivers car alternative to the BMW might want to give this car a look.  Those looking for a roomy sedan that costs $30,000.00 might want to save some money and buy a top-line family sedan like an Accord or a Passat instead.

I just rented this car for a couple of days.  For me, I'd just as soon save up more dollars and get the Saab 9-5.
