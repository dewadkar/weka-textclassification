               The <b> Dodge Viper</b> is a sleekly beautiful high performance machine. It is quickly becoming a true American classic. <b> Dodge </b> responded to the overwhelming desires of the motoring public and took this car from concept to reality. I recently had a chance to take a ride in one. A case of "middle-aged crazyness" had apparently infected one of my cousins. 

   I realize most,if not all,who are here to read opinions concerning the <b> Dodge Viper </b> are performance car enthusiasts. And I know you are here primarily to learn about the performance of this vehicle. Let me assure you the <b> Dodge Viper </b> rocks. It quickly brought back adolescent memories of Olds 442s and Plymouth Roadrunners. I'm concerned that there's too much performance available in this car. I'm concerned this may cause some drivers to get in over there heads.

  I know the great majority of <b> Viper </b> enthusiasts are very responsible and would never over do it. Still I have seen first hand how this cherry red symbol of power can turn even a mild mannered physician into a wannabe Parnelli Jones! 

<b> The Good </b>

 The <b> Dodge Viper </b> is the Chrysler Corporation's answer to the <b> Chevrolet Corvette </b>. The numbers on the <b> Viper </b> are impressive. You can go from a sitting start to sixty miles per hour in under five seconds. The <b> Viper </b> has 450 horses under the hood.  It has a V-10 engine that is very powerful. The tires are extra wide and the suspension is beefed up. The interior, referred to as a cockpit, is strictly functional with no distractions.

  The 2000 <b> Dodge Viper </b> cost about $65,000 new. The styling is reminiscent of the old <b> Jaguar </b> sports cars. The way this car drives reminds me more of the old muscle cars of the late Sixties and early Seventies. I don't think we paid that much for them, though. The gas mileage is not bad at all for such a powerful sports car. The top speed is said to be on the far side of 180 miles per hour. I can tell you that this car holds the winding curves of rural Tennessee road even at excessive speeds.

   <b> The Bad </b>

  The ride(from the passenger side)is rough and jerky. After riding for a little short time the leather seats become somewhat uncomfortable. Also heat from the powerful engine finds its way into the interior. You need to take care when enter in and exiting the car because of the heat from the pipes.

   <b> The Ugly </b>

   I've ridden in this sportster one time and once is enough for me. In my opinion, this car needs to be strictly on the race track driven by professional drivers. A car with this much performance is simply too dangerous to be let loose on the common highways and byways. Most of us are not professional drivers and we need a vehicle that gives us a greater margin for error than this beast of a car does.

  Also, it is my opinion that this sports car unleashes the wild streak in some of its drivers much more than other more sedately styled sports cars would. The <b> Jaguar XKR </b> and the <b> BMW M-Series </b> seem to me to be performance choices that are much less likely to endanger you or others on the road.

   <b> My Bottom Line </b>

   If earth rattling performance is your sole criteria, the <b> Dodge Viper </b>  might be just what you are looking for. If, on the other hand, safety figures prominently in your decision, you may want to consider other less tempting options.
