            Although I am not the primary driver, there is an A4 in the household. I drove about 20,000 miles of the total 50,000 miles, usually on long trips. I even got it up to 100mph (of course, on a "closed track out in the middle of nowhere" or something; I wouldn't want anybody to think that I would ignore the speed limit on the public highways!) and it handles very surely at 100mph.

-2.8, automatic, Quattro all wheel drive

THE GOOD:
It handles very well. I always feel in control of the car, regardless of the speed. It is very solid and somewhat firm, but not harsh. I am impressed by the solidity of the car, with very few squeaks and rattles, even on poorly maintained roads. The all-wheel drive was a plus on a trip to Yosemite in the snow.

THE BAD:
It is a gas hog. My larger Mercedes gets much better mileage. It could use more power. It has great passing power but the 0-60 is not impressive; I heard that the newer ones have more acceleration, however, so this might not be a problem anymore. The back seat is small, but not really smaller than other cars of this general size or type.

THE REALLY BAD:
I have read reviews here about how reliable the A4 is. Unfortunately, this one is not. In fewer than 40,000 miles, it has had a new steering system, transmission work, new electronics inside and most importantly, an entire new engine block. There were cracks in the engine block causing leaks. Although the dealer tried to weld it back together, the dealer failed and a new engine was ordered; we were told that it was a manufacturing defect.

The engine was replaced and things have been fine since, aside from some odd noises when starting cold, but the wait for the engine replacement was rather long (weeks, not days).

THE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY BAD:
Just got news that the transmission needs to be completely replaced at 52,000 miles (just 2,000 miles out of warranty!!!!) at a cost of $6000 minimum, possibly more.

UPDATE SEP 2001: EVEN WORSE:
The transmission and engine replacement have been MAJOR problems that are inexcusable in any vehicle manufactured today. Now, there is a radiator leak...

Power steering fluid leaking, now needs new transmission, and NOW the car was dumped. No more Audi.

PURE JUNK.



When I first wrote the review, it seemed I was alone in criticizing it. Over time, I have run into several other owners who have had bad experiences as well, so it seems to be more than just one exception. Use caution!

It is small and sporty and and although it rattles like it's falling to pieces, it seems quite solid.
