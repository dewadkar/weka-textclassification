            I bought this camera brand-new from a colleague for about $30.  I wanted to give my mother something easy to use so that she could take snapshots and send them to use via e-mail.  Good intentions.

I liked the camera at first, until I tried to use it.  It is small and attractive.  If it worked correctly it would be a great camera to slip into your pocket and take spontaneous snapshots.  Like a "poor man's" Elph.  Alas, that was not to be.

Soon after putting in the batteries and installing the software I tried to take some pictures.  Lacking an LCD, I had no way of previewing the impending disaster.  The Agfa ePhoto Smile takes pictures very slowly, and there is a several second wait between shots.  So much for quick snapshots.  As I tried to load the photos into the computer, the camera beeped and shut down.  I thought to myself, "The batteries couldn't have died after only 10 minutes of use, could they?" - they sure could and did.  After loading a new set of batteries, I successfully uploaded the images into the computer.  Horrible image quality.  I was not sure what I was looking at.  The colours were off, the images were grainy.  I get better pictures out of my old webcam.

To make matters worse, the camera started to malfunction to the point it "died" after only 3 weeks of light usage.  I contacted Agfa and they shipped out a replacement.  This camera also displayed the same terrible characteristics.  It even started to malfunction in the same way as it's predecessor.  I quickly sold it to some poor fellow in Spain.  Oddly enough - he loves it.

I cannot recommend this camera to anyone - not even a small child for his first camera.  The image quality is atrocious, the software is lousy, the battery life is short and the camera seems to be plagued with all kinds of faults.  I am glad that I only spend $30 - just think of all the people suckered into buying the ePhoto Smile at full price!  I tried to like it, but I was severely let down.
