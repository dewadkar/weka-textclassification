            <p><b>A Few Good Words...
  </b>There are a few things I really like about this car. It was somewhat 
  of a compulsive buy... our trusty 1994 Dodge Caravan showed signs of transmission 
  trouble and GM's tempting 0% financing offer was about to expire. So we high-tailed 
  it to the local dealer and drove a few GM cars, the Grand Prix GT being our 
  favorite. A quick search on the internet didn't show any huge problems with 
  the car, so we went for it. I really like the styling. The Grand Prix looks 
  sporty and drives to match. The orange and red gauge lighting is neat. We have 
  the 3.8 liter GT and the engine is more than peppy around town, but a poor craftsmanship 
  soon became a problem.  
<p><b>Annoying Things</b>
  This car has a severe lack of passing power considering how peppy it is around 
  town. It seems to wait much to long to downshift and I often have to let off 
  the gas to keep the car from redlining when I pass someone going 60 mph. I've 
  driven cars with engines half the size that had better passing ability! I'll 
  be the first to say I'm a generally slow driver and didn't buy the car for its 
  sporty appeal but the lack of power is disappointing. I list this first because 
  until you're used it it, passing someone on a two-way highway is a real safety 
  issue. 
<p>Another thing that bothered me right off the bat it that the car moves after 
  it is in park. I noticed this on a few different GM vehicles I drove, so it 
  must just be a characteristic of their transmissions. It seems to roll around 
  a 8-12 inches either direction as everyone is getting out of the car. I always 
  park carefully in the garage so it won't roll into the garage door. (The parking 
  brake does fix this - so it's the transmission parking pin.) We live in one 
  of the flattest areas in West Texas but on a trip to Oklahoma City (where they 
  have a few hills) I found out it will roll backwards when in drive if you stop 
  on a hill. It was like the car was in neutral.. This isn't so much a problem 
  unless you don't expect it. 
<p>Another thing we realized on that trip (the first long distance trip we took) 
  is that the road noise is a big problem. Crusing around town at 45-55 isn't 
  too bad on nice roads, but on cement interstates and rough asphalt above 50 
  its enough to give you a headache... I guess that's why Pontiac threw in such 
  a loud stereo. 
<p>The isn't much body roll at all, but the suspension has trouble soaking up 
  even the smallest bumps. The firm suspension also translates to a shaky steering 
  wheel through with you can feel every pebble on the road. 
<p>One of the other things that began to bother me right away was how loud the 
  exhaust is, especially for those in the back seat. Engine noise isn't bad, but 
  exhaust noise is. It also makes the car sound like a four cylinder. 
<p><b>Initial Problems
  </b>Within a month of ownership the driver side headlight fogged up and 
  quit working. The dealership replaced the light after waiting on the part a 
  week and a half. The water pump also failed within the first month -- luckily 
  we noticed the puddle of liquid under the car and didn't drive it. This was 
  also fixed within a reasonable amount of time by the local dealer. 
<p>This car has already developed more rattles and interior noises than our 1993 
  Chevrolet Blazer that we still have. The back doors and back windshield area 
  seem to be the worst. 
<p>Other problems: The air conditioner controls are cheap and the paint on them 
  is coming off already and the volume control on the radio doesn't always work. 
<p>The biggest problem which concerned us the most was that a large piece of the 
  bottom half of the dash underneath the steering wheel fell off while driving 
  down the interstate. It scared the living daylights out of me and the gauges 
  all went to zero even though the car was running. Luckily the traffic was spaced 
  enough I could get over a few lanes and pull over. I'm a big guy and didn't 
  have a problem moving my legs to control the pedals, but I would be concerned 
  if it had happened while someone smaller or elderly was driving because the 
  big piece fell on my legs. Surprisingly, the dealership had the exact part in 
  stock and replaced it the same day. They never could figure out what happened.. 
<p><b>Build Quality</b>
  I can already tell this won't last nearly as long as other cars I've owned. 
  I noticed that interior parts felt cheaper than some of the other cars we looked 
  at, but I didn't think it would be a big problem. After a few months of ownership 
  I realized this wasn't the case. The door panels shake like they are about to 
  fall off when you close the doors. The doors themselves seem flimsy and the 
  driver door seal has already begun to deteriorate. Paint and writing is coming 
  off on the interior controls. 
<p>The back seat isn't bad for skinny folks or little kids, but the seriously 
  thin padding is uncomfortable for heavier passengers. I weight about 250 pounds 
  and I can feel the support bars or whatever is underneath the seats. My mother 
  was in the back one day and said she felt like the princess and the pea. The 
  back center passenger has a slight hump in the seat and floor so its almost 
  impossible to seat three adults in the back. Leg room isn't terrible but isn't 
  roomy either. The much-advertised "wide trak" helps handling but doesn't 
  do anything for interior space. 
<p><b>Design Issues
  </b>Its a good thing that the side mirrors are large, because you can't 
  see squat out of the back window. There is also a bad blind spot on either side 
  where the back roof pillars come down. The read seat headrests are already beginning 
  to deteriorate even though the car is parked in the garage most of the time. 
  The car is very hard to get out of for anyone over 5'10". If you have long 
  legs you'll find yourself snagging your pants on the parking brake. I would 
  imagine this to be a problem for ladies as well if they're wearing a skirt or 
  loose legged pants. The parking brake sticks up much to far and looks like something 
  GM has been using from the 1970s. Also, the center console is very hard to get 
  into because its nearly in the back seat.
