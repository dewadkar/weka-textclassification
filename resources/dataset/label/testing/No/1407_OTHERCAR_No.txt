            I had the opportunity to drive a 1998 Dodge Neon for a week and a half this spring.  I rented the car from Enterprise on April 3rd as a temporary replacement for my '99 Beetle (just totaled).  On the 13th, as I walked out my back door to the parking lot where I kept it, its absence was starkly apparent.  Fortunately, it was recovered from the joy-riding teenagers who had stolen it six hours later, four doors down the street from my apartment.

As far as inexpensive four-door cars go, the Neon enjoys good popularity with its sporty styling and reasonable fuel economy.  The car has respectable handling and performance, but is relatively unremarkable.  The standard 132 hp four cylinder delivered about 27 miles per gallon in mixed city and highway driving.  It capably accelerates the car to speed, but is held back by the 3-speed automatic, which does not offer sufficient ratio possibilities for mid-speed (35-65) driving.  Oddly enough, Daimler-Chrysler did not improve this transmission with the redesigned 2000 Neon.  While driving the car, visibility is reasonable, although the slope of the car's rear end impedes rearward visibility.  

The interior of the rental version of the Neon is quite sparse.  The unsupportive drivers seat remains tolerable for little more than 25 minutes.  Manual window operation is stiff, and the car's lack of cruise control makes longer drives laborious.  Manual mirror adjustment proved quite bothersome, as it appears that the then-Chrysler corporation put more effort into designing cupholders (they do hold larger beverages than my Beetle's cupholders) than in providing for convenient operation of essential components.  The AM/FM stereo provides acceptable sound.  At least the rental version does provide air conditioning -- it seems this is one area in which no manufacturer can afford to skimp.  Trunk space is reasonable for a small car. 

The Neon I drove offered the bare minimum of safety equipment.  It did have dual front airbags and safety belts for all 5 seating positions, but did not offer anti-lock brakes (this is a $595 option on the 2000 Neon).

It is in the area of security that the Neon truly fails.  I was told by the police officer who recovered the car that it is a very easy car to break into.  It was apparent the minimal effort required of the thieves in bypassing the door lock and removing the ignition lock.  Total cost to repair the car to working condition, including repair of minor rocker panel damage and a bent rim came to over $1700 including my deductible.  The lack of security in the car makes it unacceptable for a city dweller.  The 2000 Neon ES package includes a security system.

The Neon does offer a decent value in the $12,000-$15,000 price range, however I cannot recommend it to anyone living in the city because it is so easy to steal.  I would advise anyone purchasing a Neon to equip it with LoJack for easy recovery, as the Neon I rented might never have been recovered, except for the thieves stupidity.<br><br>
