            We took delivery of our S40 two weeks ago after ordering it through Volvo Tourist and Diplomat Sales.  We had driven a '93 850 in Germany and wanted the same Volvo quality in a smaller package here in the US.

The car sits four comfortably, especially average-size or smaller people.  Our leather seats worked well on long trips, but people with longer legs may feel a little cramped.

The car is very peppy, with the turbocharger really giving it a kick when the gas pedal is pushed.  The brakes stop the car quickly, but don't give precise feedback as one may expect from a European car.  The biggest surprise is the steering, which is almost overpowered and feels like it should be on an American luxury car (not tight as one may expect).

This car's big weakness is its air conditioner.  Buyers in hot climates, beware!  Our car's A/C keeps the car very cool for the first two hours, but after that, it starts blowing warm.  If it's in the 90s outside, you can't stand to be in the car anymore.  This problem has been reported by other S40 owners. (possible software fix???) Absolutely unacceptable for any car costing over $20k.

Aside from the A/C (which we hope to have a fix for someday), we are pretty happy with the car.  It has a unique, appealing appearance, performs well, and has good interior and trunk space for its size.

This car would be good for anyone (in a cold climate area) who is looking for a quality, safe car in a small package.

This car is not for anyone who lives in a warm climate or someone looking for a tight, sporty-feeling European car.<br><br>
