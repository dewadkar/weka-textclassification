            I purchased a brand new Isuzu Trooper in 1990. It was my first new car purchase, and I was excited about it. I had heard a lot of nice things about the Isuzu, and it's 60/40
split rear door was a nice feature. The truck had a lot of cargo room and was much cheaper than the Toyota 4Runner, Mitsubishi Montero, or Nissan Pathfinder. I soon learned to discover why it was so cheap. The truck has no acceleration whatsoever. Getting on the highway was an adventure in itself. You have to avoid anything that would create a cross wind, otherwise this truck easily gets pushed around into other lanes of traffic. Transmission fluid spewed out of this thing like crazy and covered the entire rear doors of the truck. I had to return it to the dealer at least 4 times to have it repaired. The bumpers are also very cheap. Each weighed less than 25 pounds, and serve no purpose in protecting the passengers. After being rear-ended at 2 MPH
in the McDonald's drive thru while waiting in line, the entire rear bumper was crushed like a coke can. I later ended up buying a set of front and rear nurf bars, in order to have some sense of security. I was so frustrated with this vehicle that the dealer allowed me to trade it in for the new Isuzu Rodeo in mid 1991, after only a year of ownership. This was another mistake that you can read about in my Rodeo review.....
