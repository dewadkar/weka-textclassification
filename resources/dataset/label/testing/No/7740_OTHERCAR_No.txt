            A friend of mine bought a 97 neon a while back I must admit it had a lot of nice features and the price was reasonable enough.  If it were only that I would recommend this car to anyone.

However, my friend had an accident in this car he survived the accident with a few injuries none life threating or anything but he did have a broken arm and alot of cuts and bruises.

The car on the other hand was totally distroyed!!  It folded up like a sandwich and if someone had been in the passenger seat they would have surely been killed!!  This was a complete surprise because it was only a small accident with a speed of only 20mph he impacted a lighpole in his neighborhood while talking on a cell phone.

This car needs to be more survivalable for its passengers!!  In my opinion it has serious safety issues!!<br><br>
