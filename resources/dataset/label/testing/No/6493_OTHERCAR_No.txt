            DX stands for Definitely eXpendable. I recommend not purchasing any Kodak cameras of this style. If you notice Kodak currently does not manufacture the sliding shutter cover/on-off switch style of digital cameras. 

The Rant: 

I bought the DX3600 just over a year ago. It's rarely used and has probably shot just over 180 pictures. 
Simply put, it no longer functions. The shutter cover/on-off switch is no longer permitting the camera to remain on unless you put pressure on it. Kodak&#146s commitment to "quality" is highly evident when it comes to keeping the customer happy. They want to charge $150 to repair a $168 camera. Thus this becomes a disposable camera. Unfortunately I paid $225 for mine just over a year ago. 
After discovering I now owned a &#147disposable camera&#148 I opted to further investigate reviews on this model. Every single bad review listed this problem. I originally read reviews on this model prior to purchase. There were very few bad reviews. Most people that gave this camera a bad review at that time were expecting more than this camera was capable of delivering. 

Details: 

It&#146s extremely easy to use. It's a point and shoot auto focus, no-brainer. Holding the camera, it doesn&#146t really feel right in the hand. It has terrible shutter lag and did I mention this before? quits working after a year. Transfer and editing software work well. But don&#146t expect Photoshop power from EasyShare editing software, it&#146s basic as basic gets. Menu navigation is basic and easy. 
This camera requires little fidgeting and once set up menus are rarely used. Use of the optional EasyShare Dock makes using this camera even easier. However there are reports of reduced battery life using rechargeable batteries supplied with the dock. Also the dock interface with the various flavors of Windows has been reported as touch and go. I have not experienced any problems with the dock (Win 98, NT 4, XP Pro). It functions as expected. 

Picture quality is average for a 2.2 megapixel camera. I recommend purchasing the optional memory due the limited onboard memory (8MB). Zoom features work well and has options for additional lenses. However, the mounting scheme is much to be desired. To mount optional lenses, a metal ring screws into the PLASTIC lens body of the camera. Don&#146t expect to use this option for too long since the PLASTIC threads will wear out. Flash works great, sometimes overkill on Auto, use Fill for most shots. 

Battery life is good much to my surprise since other people reviewed this camera as a battery eater. I am still on the original battery. That should give you an indication on how much mine is used. Now you may think to yourself that the problem I have with this camera is a failing battery. I have tried replacing the battery (genuine Kodak) and it still fails to operate. 

Durable? no, plastic, plastic, plastic. Don't plan on taking this on safari. This is a cheaply made, extremely poorly designed camera wrapped in an average package. 

The Last Word: 

If you are capable of spending $168 on a disposable camera, buy this one. If not, save your $$$ and wait to buy a higher end camera. And if you plan to make a Kodak model a purchase option, review it thoroughly and buy a current model.
