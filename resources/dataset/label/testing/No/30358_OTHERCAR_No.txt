            I always thought the Subaru <b>Justy</b> was a cute and somewhat &quot;sporty&quot; little car, and ever since they came out in 1988, I always had a bit of a secret desire to buy one. That was, until I actually drove one for longer than a 10 minute test drive. 

The Subaru <b>Justy</b> was first introduced to the buying public in 1988 and was designed to be an economical, get-around-town-cheap sort of car, and with a mileage rate of between 35 to 40 mpg, this was <b>the</b> car to have if you delivered pizza's in or needed a car that was easy on gas. This was also an ideal car for a college student, or a commuter who didn't have to haul around any passengers (since it really doesn't have much room). 

Well, fast forward to the day I dropped my <b>Jetta</b> off at the Volkswagon dealer for an electrical problem. The service department was kind enough to set me up with a <b>Justy</b> and informed me that I would have it for a few days. &quot;Giddy&quot;, I thought, &quot;I always wanted to drive one of these&quot;. I don't know about you, but the first two things I check when I get a rental car are the amount of miles the car has on it and the amount of gas in the tank. In this case, the <b>Justy</b> had well over 25,000 miles on it and less than 1/32nd of a tank of gas. No problem, I'll just stop off and get some gas. Seven dollars and a full tank of gas later, I was on my way. 

I had the <b>Justy</b> for several days and made more than a few observations. After driving one of these cars for an amount of time that I feel was a more than fair amount, I can honestly say that I wouldn't take the Subaru <b>Justy</b> if you paid me.

<b>Price</b> - The <b>Justy</b> can easily be purchased for a couple thousand now, and sold for around $8,000.00 when it was new. A low sticker price like this makes it pretty appealing for just about any consumer on a budget. However, the resale value of the <b>Justy</b> is very low and they depreciate very fast since they are so small (both physically and mechanically). 

<b>Handling</b> - At first, I thought the <b>Justy</b> was somewhat fun to drive and reminded me of driving the go-karts at the beach. Well, after about 20 miles, that feeling got old real fast. The car has very little pickup (the engine is only a 3 cylinder and puts out just 73 horsepower), but zips around the city nicely. The amount of road noise that this car had was really unbelievable and after a few days of driving the <b>Justy</b>, I felt like I was driving a Big Wheel. 

<b>Comfort</b> - Of course, with the car physically being so small, do not expect anything near a comfortable ride. Sure, the seats are comfortable to sit in, but not for long trips. And as for room, guess again. The passengers that I took with me hated me after we arrived at our destination and had cramps in their legs from sitting in the back seats. 

<b>Safety</b> - For a car the size of the <b>Justy</b>, I really didn't feel safe at all driving it. Small and without much around me to protect me from any sort of a serious accident, I really felt like I was driving around &quot;naked&quot; in this car. And rightfully so, after turning in this car, I did some checking on this vehicle and it is rated very low for safety by Consumer Reports. It just didn't hold up well it collisions. 

Overall, this is not a car that I would recommend to anyone, even as a rental. Sure, it is an economical car, but you sacrifice both comfort and most important, safety to save a few bucks. I used to wonder why I didn't see many of these on the roads. Well, I know why. It's because they are in the junk yard with a funeral wreath around the car. I am just praying that the drivers of these cars survived better than their car.  <br><br>
