            Mercedes-Benz has normally been a great car company with excellent cars that were expensive, but luxurious.  Then, they started producing the C230 Kompressor model that has the same engine as the small SLK 230.  The Mercedes C43 AMG was the original performance C class model, and it had power, luxury, and was sporty but the price was high.  Now with the introduction of the C230 Kompressor, Mercedes tried to make a cheaper, sport sedan that would appeal to people who want to spend less money.  The car turned out horrible!  Don't expect anything special about this car, because everything is an option.  Even full leather seating surfaces are option...and this is a Mercedes Benz!  The price for the C230 Kompressor seems low, but that is for the base model without any options so you end up paying around $35,000 for the car.  The engine, which is the 2.3 liter supercharged 4 cylinder, is borrowed from the small SLK 230 coupe.  This engine is surely powerful enough for the little coupe, but not for the large sedan.  For just a little more money, you can get the C280 with a 6 cylinder that even has more horsepower and has many standard options.  For around $35,000 there are much better luxury cars that you can buy.  If you are considering buying a C230 Kompressor, I would think twice and look to the competition before buying.<br><br>
