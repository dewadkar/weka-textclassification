            I was offered a car for graduating from college...a used car...where my parents/grandma would put the down payment and I would pay the rest. My mother decided that a used car was not good enough for city driving and 200 mile commutes home periodically, so we went down to the local Chevy dealer. 

I was taken by surprise at the idea of a brand new car, so the day my mom woke me up to go get a car was the same day that I signed the paper work.  Although the Cavalier is a very dependable car, it has had its minor problems...such as the alternator dying for no apparent reason with not even 35,000 miles on it, along with brakes. 

It is very reminiscent to me of our Camaro we had when I was in high school. That car got dug into the ground, quickly, which I always attributed to it having gone through 4 new teenage drivers. I can honestly say now that that was not entirely the problem. It has got to be something with Chevrolets! 

There are other, even more reliable cars out there, such as a Honda Civic, that also gets great gas mileage, costs almost the same, is the same size, has similar routines, but will not start to fall apart on you within 3 years as my Cavalier has.
