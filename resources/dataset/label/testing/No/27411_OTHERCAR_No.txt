            I bought a brand new Dodge Neon Sport Coupe in 1995.  The car got great gas mileage, it was very comfortable, but did it ever have electrical problems and problems. 

But after the three year warranty ran out we had to repair electrical problems, clutch cable,timing belt problems and the starter.  The electrical problems were just fuses but after replacing them constantly gave you an uneasy feeling of never knowing when your break lights and blinkers were going to to out. 

You would think the starter would be fairly inexpensive, well true if you could buy it at auto zone or some place like that, but no you have to order it from the dealer.  It was around $300.00 at the dealer. 

The clutch cable would have been $15.00 at Napa but no we again had to go to the dealer and pay $85.00 to replace it which was no easy task.  But the last straw was when the timing belt had to be replace because of the bad starter.  

My advise to you or anyone would be make sure on a Dodge Neon would be to get an extended warranty.  We traded the car in right a way to get rid of the money pit!<br><br>
