            This car was purchased in 1997 for $1500.  It had 98000 miles and was starting to smoke.  I had the valve seals replaced at  110,00 and it fixed the problem. This is a known problem with 3.0 V6.  At about 115,000, the transmission went out.  A full rebuild at an ATRA Certified center set me back $1200.  The car ran great for about 2yrs after that.  At around 150,000, the fuel pressure regulator went out and the connectors on the alternator regulator broke.  A new harness was $310 through Chrysler so I happily paid the junk yard $20 for a used one!  Overall, except for the transmission and valve seals, most of the problems encountered would most likely happen with any other american made fuel injected V6.   

This is a very comfortable car to drive and the stock sound system isn't bad at all.  I have had problems with power windows but that's minimal.  It's an easy fix.  The body is still in good shape with very little rust.  It has been rear ended a couple of times with no damage to either bumper.  

After doing some research, I found that Chrysler (according to the ATRA technician) almost recalled the 604A automatic transmission for 1990.  There were many problems with this. The problem I had was the low reverse seal. If you have this transmission rebuilt, make sure that they put the upgrade kit in with the "D" seals and expanding ring that goes under the seals.  

Overall for about $3000, I have gotten close to 60,000 miles out of the car.  It's not sporty but it will get up and go!
