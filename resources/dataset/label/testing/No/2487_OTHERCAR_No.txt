            It only had 3 miles when I bought it.  The first week I was back at the dealer because the 'engine check light' would not go out.  They 'fixed' it.  That should have been a sign for me to get rid of it.  Within' the next year I had took the car back to the dealership over 15 times for different things, a couple of them twice. I had an extended warranty on it, which was good because at about 37,000 miles, when the original warranty went out, the 'mass air flow sensor' went out.  The extended warranty saved me about 500 bucks. Between 50,000 - 60,000 I had to replace the water pump.  Then after my extended warranty went out I had to replace the air conditioner compressor, battery, and it started leaking transmission fluid. Keep in mind that I've been getting the transmission fluid changed once every 10,000 miles and oil changed about once every 4000 miles. The timing belt broke at about 70,000, which is cool, because I was going to replace it anyway. 

When I put it in drive if the rpm is less than 1000 rpm it will shake like a drunk man.  Right now I have about 195,000 on it and had to get the transmission replaced because it just quit.  Not to mention the fact that I could only find one junkyard w/ a transmission, and they wanted $650 for it, when they pulled it out the transmission place checked it and said it was junk.  So I had one ordered from out of state, because I couldn't find a used one in state.  It would've costed $1900 + to rebuild mine.  I just got it out the shop a week ago and am trying to get rid of it now.  When I go to a dealership and they ask what I have for a trade in I always ended the recipient of a hyundai joke.  Maybe I can trade it in for a pack of gum if I'm lucky.  

I would suggest buying a hyundai for your enemies..
