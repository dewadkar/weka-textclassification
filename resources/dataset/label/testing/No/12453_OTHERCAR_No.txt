            We have been loyal Volvo customers for many years. We had 740 Station Wagon, 940 Sedan, 960 Station Wagon, 960 Sedan, and S90. Right now we have V90 and S40. The S40 was purchased in January 2000 and it looks like it is the last Volvo purchase in our family. Here are the reasons:

Quality � Since January the car had major problems 7 times. In addition to that, it is full of little things that are just nuisances, things falling off, noises inside the car and outside, and so on.

Safety � We used to buy Volvos because we were convinced of their safety. Now we have serious doubts. Here are some of the problems that had to be fixed since January: crush sensor not working properly, side impact sensor missing (!!!), intermittent leak in the fuel system.

Service � All our Volvos were purchased and serviced at The Volvo Store, Winter Park, Florida. After our experience with the S40, we completely lost our confidence in their ability to service and fix cars. The problem with the fuel system was &quot;fixed&quot; five times so far, with negative results. There is always the possibility that there is a problem with the design of S40 and the car simply cannot be fixed.

Customer service � We expected better treatment from the company we were loyal customers of for many years. We wanted to discuss our options with the store manager, but he refused to talk to us. All we get is &quot;if you have a problem with your car, bring it to the service department so that it can be fixed&quot;. We deserve more respect and care from them.
