            I bought this car when it was 1 year old and 6,000 miles.  The problems started with the test drive.... the power top got stuck down.  I thought it was a fluke (never heard anything bad about VW before) so I bought the car anyway.  After that I had problems with the alarm going off for no reason, the windows safety not working, the power windows going up then back down which was supposedly fixed but not, a gap between the passenger window and rollbar which was supposedly fixed but was not (which makes car washes risky), the top not going down, the trim falling off the passenger door, the "leather" coming out on the passenger door, the "leather" wearing very badly in the shift and brake, the cruise control not working when I first got it, then turning on by itself for no reason,  the floor vent really doesn't work (my service guy said that's just how VWs are), the key on the driver side doesn't always engage the alarm, and I think that is all until last night.  I made a stop on my way home and the car wouldn't start.  A 4 year old car with 42,000 miles shouldn't have that trouble.  And on top of it, the switch on my dome light is now hanging out.  I love my car, but I am very frustrated with all of the problems.  If I didn't have all of the quality problems I would rate the car a 10, however the best I can give it is a 4.
