            I was surprised to read all the positive reviews about the 2001 GTIs.  Driving my car the first month and half was fun.  The car was smooth, it picked up really really well.  After that, however, I became a frequent customer to VW service.  My car was in the shop every month.  

PROBLEMS:
1.  Airbag malfunctions (the airbag light goes on, they put in some new switch that i'm a guinea pig for)
2.  Window breaks and falls into the door (something to do with the window motor)
3.  Passenger side lock does not work.  It won't lock.
4.  Changed the relay of my back right side blinker.
5.  Leather is cracking.
6.  The side carpeting border around the door fell off.  The sealant wasn't sealing anymore.  
7.  Changed out the airflowmeter.
8.  Replaced a valve (don't know which one)
9.  Found three faults within my car.  Something to do with air leaking into the turbo.  So changed some valve located around the turbo.  
10.  Car drives like crap now.  Seems to be a greater turbo lag. 
11.  Lots and Lots of Rattling.  

REASONS GIVEN BY VW SERVICE REPS AS TO WHY MY CAR HAS PROBLEMS:

1.VW cars aren't built for Texas heat.  -- reason given 1000 miles away from my 24,000 warranty expiring.  And i put that on within 2 months.  

2. My car must have been built on a Friday.  

3.  It's German manufactured.  Mexico manufactured is better.  (Although I've heard the opposite too)

8 & 9 happened less then a month apart.  I dont think VW even knows what the problem is or how to fix it.  Engine light just keeps coming on.  

My car will be 2 years old in August.  An acquaintance of mine bought an Automatic GTI as well.  It's two months old and he's driven it for only a month (he's become a frequent customer of VW Service as well)

I'm not to literate on car mechanics.  I'm basically saying what I picked up from the whole speal they give you when you want them to explain exactly what the problem is/was.  Unfortunately, I still love my car--When it drives and is working well in between problematic periods.  It was really smooth and fast.  And the car just looks good.  Plus it was my first car purchase.  However with problem #10 arising, my love is diminishing.  Best of luck.
