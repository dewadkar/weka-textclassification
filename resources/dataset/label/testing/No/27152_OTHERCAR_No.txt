            My wife a 1998 Astro van against my advice- but what's new! Like my Chevy 3500 diesel, her Astro has already been a nightmare. During the first year, she has already had to drive back to the dealer 6 times for electrical problems including a failed alternator, a failed battery, and  defective electronic light switches. Living in the Denver area, the 6-cylinder engine really looses power climbing the mountain highways. I am only 6'2&quot; and I cannot fit in either the driver's seat or the passenger side. This thing is definitely built for small people and children. On the positive side, Chevy has always had a superior paint job, but that's about all. My advice, buy any thing but a Chevy!<br><br>
