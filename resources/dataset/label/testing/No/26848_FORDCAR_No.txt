            After many years of driving a 3 door minivan, with three kids my husband and I decided go for something more practical.  We both like the look of the Expedition and the fact that it has the third seat.
  We got to the dealership and we gung ho and ready to buy, I took it for a spin while my husband conversed with the salesman, upon my return and to the dismay of the salesman I told my husband no way.
 After he drove the Expedition he also agreed.  We were reluctant to reject this vehicle because until you drive it - its great!  The interior is well designed and comfortable but the positive aspects of the vehicle are mostly aesthetic. 
   The truck feels narrow and &quot;pigeon toed&quot; while driving, rendering it a poor handling truck.  The suspension feels too bouncy making the truck feel as though it were all over the road so to speak, especially over bumps.  I drove the truck for about 45 minutes, and my husband the same, so in total we drove for an hour and a half and were unfortunately not at all impressed.<br><br>
