            Many people do not think highly of Lexus. For those of you who do not know the origins of Lexus, it is a branch of Toyata which is why there is a huge resembalance between the LS class and the Toyota Camry.  The purpose of Lexus is to provide more luxorious rides than that of Toyota and also compete with luxury manufacturers such as BMW, Mercedes. Nissan has a similar branch called Infiniti.

The SC 400 Coupe is a car to be reckoned. Be wary BMW and Mercedes because your place atop the ladder is about to be shook by the sheer power and raw speed of the Lexus 400 Coupe. With 290 horses, the car blazes from 0 to 6 mph in a mere 6.1 seconds.  

<b>Performance</b>
The SC 400 has 32 valve, four cam, V-8, yes a eight cyclinder engine. To enhance the performace of the engine and gear shift ration, Lexus has created the Variable Valve Timing with intelligence which tell you when the optimal time to shift is and will adjust its timing in accordance with your specific type of driving style. The tramission is also blended with a sophisticated Electronic Control Tramission to provide added performance.

Opinion: Although having driven my SC 400 for over half a year now, I somehow find the power a little dissappointing. The design of the hood makes the front of the car extremly long. I feel with that much space, you can somehow crank more than just 290 horses. Although that is enough power, I dont feel it is appropriate for a V-8. The need to either turbo charge this car or replace the headers and exhaust to crank out some more horses and torque. I feel that the Lexus SC can crank out at least 300 horses at the least.

<b>Suspension</b>
The Lexus has rackon pinon steering which is standard for most cars. It also uses a double wishbone suspension which stiffens the car greatly to provide tighter turns and accelerations through corners without loss of much speed.  The Lexus SC 400 also incorporated front and rear stabilizer bars which tightens the steering of the front wheels and the back.  Together, the Lexus handles like a dream.

Opinion: The Lexus definetly handles like a dream machine. Rear and front stabilizer bars are typically after market upgrades for cars.  I like how Lexus already incorporate them into the SC 400.  I feel that Lexus can either drop the car about a inch and maybe incorporate standard 17 inch rims with some Pirelli ZR rated tired to provide better traction and control.

<b>Overall Opinion</b>
The Lexus definetly is a superb car. It has astouding performance and superior control. Despite such great marks, I still feel the Lexus is not worth the price you pay. At $56,600, I just dont feel the car is worth the price. Upgrades can range from $2500 for leather seats, $500 for a spoiler, $1,500 for a Nakamichi premium sound package $1,700 for chrome 17 inch rims. On top of that the dealer price migh increase to $60,000 and plus options and tax, I paid well over $65,000 for this car. I would rather save for a little while longer and purchase a M5 which can seat four comfortably. The Lexus is just not affortable in the sense that it seats 2 comfortably and is in my mind an overpriced sports car.<br><br>
