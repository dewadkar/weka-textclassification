            My wife and I purchased this Jeep when it was about 2 years old.  It had been well cared for, and had 34,000 miles on it.  It is the 2WD sport model.

We now have 84,000 miles on it. I have had absolutely no mechanical problems with this vehicle.  The Jeep has the 4.0 H.O. 6 cyl. engine in it.  The engine is very responsive and snappy.  It has gotten me out of more than one &quot;tight spot&quot;.  The seats are cloth and show very little signs of wear.  Overall the interior is roomy and comfortable.

I do have a couple of complaints, however.  It does rattle alot.  It sounds like it might have a broken body mount.  At first I thought it had a loose shock.  So I replaced them.  It does ride a little smoother now, but I still have that big rattle.  That is not the only rattle.  The dash also seems to be loose.  And it also has developed several squeaks.  The only other thing that I would warn you of is the fact that the 2WD model is not very good on snow and ice.  Actually it is plum lousy.

So would I buy again?  There alot of SUV's out there.  I would look around first.
