            I have a 1992 Passat wagon, that I love.  It's got clean lines, handles beautifully, I can cram a lot into it, and it's a great car for trips.  It has even been in a few accidents, and so far (knock wood)no one has been seriously hurt.  I love that it's easy to find in a parking lot.
My mechanic loves it, too.  I am not only on a first name basis with Charlie, I can tell you when he gets into the shop, and when the coffee is fresh.  Low clearance is the least of my worries.  I have had the timing belt blow, and take with it 8 of the 16 cylinders.  This was before 50k, thank you very much.  I have spent almost as much money keeping the dang thing running, aside from brakes, and incredibly expensive tires, than I think I would happily spend on a NEW car.
Don't even consider adding anything to the electrical system, like a car alarm.  The electronics in this car are hard pressed to keep up with the clock, seatbelt and radio.  If I were told that the '92 Passat had been designed by an engineering team consisting solely of retired acid dropping Rhesus monkeys, I would have no evidence to the contrary.  I have jump started this car, purchased batteries, and begged and pleaded with someone, anyone, to fix the wiring.  It can't be done.  And VW does not recall their mistakes.
Would I buy another one?  Probably not.  I can't see putting that kind of money into anything that just doesn't run well.  If anyone tries to sell you a '92 VW Passat wagon, run, do not walk, to your nearest bicycle shop.  No matter how cute the car is, no matter how much you think you will love it, no matter how good the deal--it's just not worth it.<br><br>
