            Being a loyal VW Diesel owner I purchased a 2000 TDI to replace 1996 Turbo GL (176,000 mi).  Very happy with performance, trim, drive, repair, etc. EXCEPT--this vehicle is not available with a block heater -- a MAJOR concern for cold weather climates.  

VW arbitrarily removed this option from 1999 models on without informing the dealers or potential buyers. (In a northern climate the block heater is treated as standard equipment.)  There are no longer frost plugs in the block, therefore not even an opportunity to install an aftermarket heater.  

In contact with corporate VW service/parts they have been unhelpful and evasive and said that an oil pan heater is in works but no time frame when available.  During another conversation with VW the customer service manager stated that the product was not in the works.  So what is the real story??

If an aftermarket heater is installed, be very cautious, as fires have been reported and VW is not accepting any liability.  Dealers and heater manufacturers are apparently liable in VW's eyes however,in my opinion, VW should back the dealer's liability as the problem stems from a design/manufacturing decision.  If pan heater not installed, be prepared for freeze-out and gelling of fuel which not only is a major inconvenience, but also a potential safety concern.  

BE DILIGENT WHEN YOU DISCUSS THIS WITH YOUR DEALER AND GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT!  Also, be prepared to change your oil to &quot;0&quot; weight in the winter months as heavier weight oil will cause difficulty at start-up and potential long term damage to cylinder walls.  While VW offers no-charge oil changes up to 25,000 mi, no such luck for the diesel owners. You will end up paying for additional oil changes when the seasons change. (I'm on my 4th change and the vehicle only has 5100 mi. on it.  BE PREPARED FOR THE COSTS AS THE ENGINE USES SYNTHETIC OIL!!  

EXTREME CAUTION --  Recently VW have found that there is a fuel line restriction in cold weather which is caused by the gelled fuel not passing through a valve.  I recently experienced this while driving in Wisconsin.  Apparently VW knows that this can occur on long cold drives and has notified dealers about the problem.  The vehicle &quot;powered out&quot; leaving me stranded 1.5 hours from either Eau Claire or Madison -- the closest VW dealerships.    

This can happen, however I was using a treatment for the diesel which is an anti-gelling agent and it still happened.  The dealer said they had other customers which this happened to. There is a solution for the problem by apparently by-passing the valve however VW is not recommending this procedure to the dealers until a new part is designed and ready for installment.  But not all vehicles are going to be upgraded, only those in which were purchased in colder climates!! This should be every Jetta owner's concern as you are at risk if you travel to a colder climate.
 

THINK ABOUT YOUR SAFETY -- Could you survive in below zero temps if your car freezes on the highway??  This may present a serious liability to VW as they know the vehicles do this and this info comes from the Dealer Councils who are concerned for THEIR customer's safety. 

I love my Jetta, HOWEVER I'm getting rid of it due to the above problems and VW evasive responses to my concerns.  I am so upset that I traded my 1996 in for this risk.  Don't misunderstand me -- this has been a great performing auto and I love the look and drive -- I am just so concerned for my safety (and treatment by the manufacturer) that I am leaving the VW &quot;family&quot;.  Its a great car -- but not for me.  I only wish that VW was upfront with the issues and then I could have decided if the purchase made sense given my situation.    BUYER BEWARE! <br><br>
