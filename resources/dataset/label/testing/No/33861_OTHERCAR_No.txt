            A few years ago I obtained a Ford Visa Gold Card which accumulated a credit of $5,600.00 towards a new Ford.  Because the best (most reliable) cars I'd owned to date were Japanese, I felt a Mercury Villager, being essentially a Nissan designed product, would give me the same satisfaction.  I then discovered that Ford was no longer selling Villagers in Canada after 1998, so after some serious hunting, managed to track down and purchase one of the last '98s left in the country at a very attractive price.

I've owned a Plymouth Voyager, a Volvo wagon, and my all time favorite, a 1993 Toyota Camry wagon in the past, so had no hesitation in purchasing a mini-van.

I've put on over 23,000 km in the 8 months I've owned the Villager and have found it to be, for the most part, an excellent vehicle.  As noted by other reviewers, the Villager rides and handles more like a car than a truck ... effortlessly finding it's way into city parking spots, partially do to it's tight turning radius.  In foul weather driving, both rain and snow, it holds the road well and stops like a car, unlike my old Voyager which had a tendency to slide through stop signs.  Although I have read complaints that the Villager is underpowered, I find it quite peppy with good acceleration.

The interior is roomy ( as a van's should be ) and the ergonomics of the sparse but functional dash are excellent.

I do have a couple of complaints however.  Firstly, the seats, although initially quite comfortable, give me severe discomfort in my hips after a long (3 hours plus ) drive.  I'm 6'ft tall and weigh 240 lbs. and naturally don't have the smallest butt in town.  What I've discovered is because of the seat design ( a hollow plastic base with a 2&quot; lip around the top perimeter...like a toilet seat, with the soft foam seat padding stretched across the top opening) the extreme edges of my pelvic bone winds up supporting most of my weight.  My rear sinks down into the seat but the hard plastic lip catches my pelvis.   Like I said, this gets very uncomfortable after a long ride.

My main complaint however has to do with a creaking sound which occurs just as the vehicle starts or stops.  I've had it into the shop 5 times now and they've replaced shocks, lubricated cables, tightened and even welded bolts in the rear suspension, and replaced bushings and suspension brackets.  Each time, the problem seems fixed but comes back again after a day or two.  As a matter of fact, I just got it back from service a couple of hours ago.  This time they simply re-tightened some bolts again.  I'll know within a couple of days whether or not it's really fixed.  Somehow I doubt it.

I've also had a problem with the rear wiper.  It stayed in the down position and the motor wouldn't shut off.  For that they replaced the motor assembly.

Perhaps I've been spoiled by the Toyota Camry which gave me absolutely no trouble after 270,000 km. but I had read many glowing reports about the Villager and didn't expect this much grief in the first 8 months.  I asked a '93 Villager owner I met if he'd had many problems and he spent an hour telling me horror stories.  I'm assuming that after 5 years, the multitude of bugs he had would be fixed.

Anyway, I'm a little disillusioned right now, despite the fact that I do like the Villager and the way it looks, rides, and handles.  Only time will tell I guess.
