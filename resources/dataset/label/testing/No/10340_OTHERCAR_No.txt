            Hi. I traded in my cherry original-owner 1984 Black Jetta GLI when the engine rebuild showed signs of wear. Tempted to spring for a 2001 Jetta VR6, I decided there were too many of them on these San Francisco East Bay streets.

So I looked at a Mazda Protege ES, the Honda Civic EX, and finally a 2001 Toyota Corolla &quot;S.&quot;

I got it from an inexperienced salesman who didn't notice Fremont Toyota's usual $4k &quot;dealer markup&quot; sticker was not affixed. So I bought it with a 7.1% Federal Credit Union loan after a stupid, rather shady misadventure with the Toyota loan department. Don't want to mention what they gave me for the GLI.

When I first saw the S I liked it. It had a subtle little spoiler with that &quot;third eye&quot; built in and, thankfully, the stock shelf-mounted light 
deactivated and concealed. I also liked that the car was built at the NUMMI plant in Fremont six miles away, contributing to our local healthy economy. It burns 20 cent-a-gallon cheaper fuel and gets about 30 mpg.

The black and grey fabric seats seemed supportive enough. The dash lights and steering wheel were much cooler than any Corolla I'd ever seen.

But in the six months I've driven it, with about 4200 miles on the clock,
I have mixed feelings about the car.

For one thing, at 5'11&quot;&quot;, 290#, I'm a big dude and getting in and out of this thing is a hassle. Once seated, however, the headroom is most adequate. The &quot;Indigo Ink Pearl&quot; paint is handsome. The Toyota five-spoke satin-alloy wheels set it apart.

The air conditioning works great and the CD player kicks my butt!

The downside is performance. Compared to the Jetta, the &quot;S&quot; leans and rolls like a real pig. The standard engine with a 4 speed electronic auto transmission is no match for the Jetta's wicked responsiveness. Of course it was my decision to forgo a 5 speed for the auto, due to my bumper-to-bumper Dumbarton Bridge commute. Guess you just can't compare the two at the Corolla's price.

So what I'm saying is, I'm living with my decision to lose the fun-to-drive but no longer dependable GLI for this new quiet, more comfortable but less fun to drive Corolla S. Am I getting old? <br><br>
