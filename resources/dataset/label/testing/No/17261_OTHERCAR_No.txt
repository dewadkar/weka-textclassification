            7/25/01 Update!!! 60,203 miles and another breakdown!!! The transmission sensor went out yet again. We were driving along when all of the sudden, the odometer goes out. Great you sorry #@$#!!! Then BANG! Slams into second gear and stays there. I call Dodge armed with my extended warranty to find that it does NOT cover this sensor. She gives me the quote of parts and labor over the phone without hesitation. You think she's had a lot of these repairs???? Well, after I get in to the dealer and sit, sit, sit; I am informed that the belt tension pulley is no good and yes guessed it, NOT covered under warranty. So almost $250 later and furious, I leave with my purple lemon. Will Keep you posted.

2/01 - We bought this car with 28,000 miles on it. It was a beautiful looking car- leather seats, fog lights, all the bells and whistles. I bought an extended warranty since it was used. My joy was short lived however, when on Memorial Day while on the way to the beach, the transmission jerked down into 2nd gear at a speed of 55mph. This almost caused a loss of control of the vehicle. We had to turn around and hobble home, losing our holiday weekend. The dealer came and towed it off. Later we find a sensor was at fault and commonly goes out on this vehicle. Then the driver seat controls ceased to work, they replaced the seat with the controls upside down. Then the foglights ceased to work, they replaced the switch. Then a high pitched whine started happening under the hood and the rear passenger electric window broke. They fixed the window, which broke again after it was out of warranty, and never fixed the whine. It is much worse now. Oh and yes, the dash is developing a crack in it. Unlike the other extended warranties I have purchased from other dealers, this one requires a co-pay, which no one told me. I have to pay $75 for EACH fix now. Great! Do NOT buy a Dodge!!! No loaner cars either. For me with just one vehicle, this is costly. I will have to rent a car when the purple lemon goes to the shop. My advise? Go to Ford or Chevy!
