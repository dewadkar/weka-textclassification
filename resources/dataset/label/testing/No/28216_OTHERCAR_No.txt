            I brought this vehicle because it's very roomy.   Inside it's wide with lots of arm and leg space.  I had truly feel in love with this vehicle.     Suddenly the truth came about.  Since Sept. 1999 my vehicle short of 1 year old has falling apart.  First the passenger window on the driver's side would not go down.  Shortly after, approximately 2 days later, it rained.  It rains not only outside the vehicle, but, inside too.   Water drips constantly inside the vehicle.  It drip's directly above the floor mat.  Also, the speedometer goes erratic so I don't know what speed the vehicle is at.  The ABS light as well as the RED Brake light stays on.  I took the vehicle to the Dodge dealer four times and each time they could not find the problem. Finally, they changed the motor for the window.  They did locate the problem with the speedometer and they did fix that problem.  I was required to pay $100.00 deductible. This vehicle still leaks inside.  The RPM Section races into the danger zone.  When this takes place the vehicle will not forward but,feels like it's losing it's speed. This SPORT'S UTILITY VEHICLE, is not safe at all.  The problems that are occurring are dangerous.  I have made contact with the Company and they feel that as long as they can fix it, there's no problem.  A commuter stated that she also had transmission problems.  They replaced her transmission 4 times, she traded her Dodge in, Oh did I mention that her vehicle was less than one year also.  I will be getting rid of my Dodge very soon.  Don't waste your time buy somewhere/something else.  I will never buy a Dodge vehicle again.  Anyone can see that this is a true lemon.  I believe that the durango was made with faulty transmission problems.  Goodbye, Dodge Durango.....
