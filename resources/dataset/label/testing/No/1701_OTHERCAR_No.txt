            This is the first Honda that I have owned.  When I first decided to get an SUV, I knew that I didn't want a full-size one; at that time, the only available choices were the Toyota RAV-4, the Suzuki Sidekick, and the Honda CR-V.  I eliminated the Suzuki Sidekick right off the bat because it is just too cramped, I just can't imagine spending hours in that cabin on a long trip.  The RAV-4 has basically the same problem and also the interior decor gives a really "cheap" feel compared to the CR-V.  The only reason that I even considered an SUV was that I live in a city which snows around 6 months of the year and it's important to have good traction and control if you plan to go out in those six months at all.  So I decided on the CR-V based on that fact that it was the best out of what I could afford.  I've always heard good things about Honda vehicles so I wasn't concerned about the reliability factor.  So here's a breakdown of the things I like and the things I don't like about the car:

Likes:

The interior of the car is extremely roomy while the car itself is not that large.  The interior decor is very nicely done, gives a warm and comfortable feel.  The ride is really smooth and cornering is great despite the higher center of gravity of the vehicle.  Lots of cargo space, great for moving furniture.

Dislikes:

The main thing is that this vehicle is underpowered.  The engine is way too small for such a heavy vehicle.  The automatic transmission is not very "smooth" and it sometimes has problems "looking" for the right gear.  The fuel economy is poor for a Japanese car.  The air-conditioning is not powerful enough.

Overall, this is a good car for getting around town, but it's not very good if you need to do quick merges on the freeway.  I still find it acceptable since I don't drive that aggressively.  I'll definitely keep it for a while since it's great for moving stuff around.  I heard that the problems I noted were fixed for the newer models; with these problems fixed, it's a great utility vehicle.
