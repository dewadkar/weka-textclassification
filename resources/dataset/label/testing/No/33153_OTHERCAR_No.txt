            Consider this a long test drive as opposed to an ownership review. My 98 Catera was getting fixed and I got this car as a loaner. Of course its no Caddy but it had decent power and handling.

Things I disliked about it:

* really weird feel to the cloth seats - it was somewhat like a fake velvet feel that made the hair on the back of my neck rise! but that maybe subjective...

* steering feels a little loose/wobbly over 65 mph

* the horn is almost in the middle of the wheel -
there should be buttons on all the spokes for faster access with your thumb

Things I liked:

* lots of headroom (more than a catera & i'm 6'1")
* good elbow support (also better than a catera)
* decent power & handling
* good climate control - it seemed to cool the car in a reasonable amount of time
* good visibility around the car (much better than a caddy)
* good location for the ignition (on the dash as opposed to the steering column) - once you get used to it, its harder to go back to wrapping your arm around the steering to start other cars
