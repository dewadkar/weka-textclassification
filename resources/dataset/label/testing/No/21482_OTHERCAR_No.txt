            First off I must state that I absolutely love Pontiac Grand Prixs. I bought my first, a 93 Grand Prix SE, dirt cheap and loved that car to death. When used 1997 "Widetrack" Grand Prixs stating hitting the streets as program cars in 1998, I jumped at the chance to buy one. Overall the car was nice, but be very careful when purchasing a 1997 model. This was the first year Pontiac radically changed the GP design and there are quite a few flaws and quality problems associated with this year that were worked out by Pontiac in later years. These include:

1) Nonworking power windows - Very common problem with 97 GPs. A window may work one day, then quit the next, then work fine the day after that. One time both of my rear door windows quit working, then the next day they worked fine and the front door windows didn't work, then the day after that they all worked. Fortunately, the windows rarely quit working in the "down" position. Unfortunately, this problem usually crops up after the factory warranty expires.

2) 3.1L powertrain problems - The 3.1 engine and transmission are solid performers with good power, but expect expensive main seal engine oil leaks and transmission noise / problems after 50k to 60k miles. I STRONGLY SUGGEST buying a GP with the 3.8L powertrain. Much better, more heavy duty engine and transmission design and comparable in money to the 3.1L when you're buying used. Also, the 3.8L models come with aluminum wheels, 16" tires, and an updated interior. Both SE versions sell for around the same money used, so might as well get the nicer model.

3) Carpet problems - Pontiac used carpeting in the 97 model year that wears quickly. Look carefully immediately in front of the driver's seat at the carpet in a 97 GP and you'll understand what I mean. I've actually had chunks of carpet pile vacuum up during cleaning.  

4) Rear end "clunk" sound - The rear suspension in 97 GPs had design problems that results in a "clunk" sound from the rear end when going over bumps and kind of sounds like the trunk isn't latched. Sometimes the dealer can fix this by tightening up the rear suspension, and sometimes they can't.

Overall, I suggest looking for a 98 or 99 GP when considering a used model. By these years Pontiac had most of the bugs worked out. I personally own a 2000 Grand Prix SE (traded the 1997 GP in last January with 70k miles) that is free of all of these problems and wouldn't trade it for anything!
