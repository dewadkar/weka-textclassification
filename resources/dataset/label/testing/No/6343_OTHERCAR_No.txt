            I recently purchased a 1997 Starmark C230 Benz. This car is definitely not worth all of the excitement and wonderful reviews it has received over the years. I agree with most owners that this automobile has many safety features, but nothing that I can't get from a Japanese car. My Mercedes is extremely sluggish-no power whatsoever. The interior of this car is something called MB-Tex! I only recently found out this is vinyl. Someone please tell me why Mercedes would put vinyl in their automobiles? And no CD player in my car? What is that all about? Must we wait until 2010 for Mercedes to put CD players in their cars as standard equipment? Overall, I feel this car is a waste of money, whereas for the same price, you can purchase a Japanese auto that will give you many many years of reliable miles. There is absolutely nothing special or extraordinary about a Mercedes-Benz.<br><br>
