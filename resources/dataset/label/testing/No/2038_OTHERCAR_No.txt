            <b>This review is based on a one-year ownership with 23,000 miles driven.</b>
Main use: city (work and shopping, 5 - 10 mile distances), many 200+ mile trips, some long trips: 2,000 + 4,000 + 7,000 miles.

We needed a car for only a year, after which we returned to Europe. We didn't like the used car dealers at all, so we decided to go for an inexpensive new car.
After doing some research on the Internet, we chose the Sephia, basically because it was the roomiest in the back for our 3 children (one very skinny).

The Kia salesman was very friendly and non-pressing, he let us have the car overnight, and finally matched the lowest price I had found on the internet, $ 11,880 all in.

From the start we were quite happy with the car.

<b>Only minor glitches annoyed us:</b>
- Vents: you cannot close one individually. So if you have air blowing at your head, the passenger will, too. The central vent for the driver also blows at the driver's head in almost any position
- Engine noise: too noisy when going full speed uphill in 3rd gear
- Intermittent noise from glove compartment
- Fuel: gauge shows more gas than available, lamp warns a little late
- Mileage: only around 20 mpg for short distances
- Spare tire: utility (thin) type
- Slow to pull up (I mean, the first couple of yards)

<b>On the positive side we had:</b>
- Engine: smooth and well running, silent
- Handling: easy to drive
- A/C: cold
- Trunk: fair size, good for 2 suitcases and more stuff. With the backseats down we fitted 5 suitcases easily
- Mileage: around 30 mpg on the highway

<b> After 1 year we started to worry about the following:</b>
- Automatic transmission: when slowing down, it did not shift down when it should, getting to the point that sometimes it stayed in 2nd gear when the car stopped, and it started in 2nd gear when pulling up!
- Driver&#146s window was tough to pull up.
- A/C had an odor to it
- Tires were almost gone


<b>In conclusion, we had a car that served us well for a year, maybe we were lucky, but I would <b>not recommend buying it.</b>
