            After owning a 1992 Honda Accord I was sold on the accord series. I was impressed by my Accord but left wanting more due to its poor interior and A/C (a major factor in Houston). However, I am not nearly as impressed by the new accord. It seems like the pros and cons of my older accord have swapped with the pros/cons of the newer accord. While I have not been particularly <i> dissapointed </i> by this accord, I have certainly not been <i> impressed </i> as I was with the old one. 

<b> The Pros </b>

Honda has certainly taken heed to the complaints regarding the old accord. The shoddy interior that was prominent with the older models has been replaced with an almost luxurious interior (although I should note I have the leather model). The interior shows no signs of fading or peeling; the leather feels as soft and pleasant now as it did when I bought it. 

Mileage is also fairly good, although a bit under my older accord. Once again, the accord takes the throne regarding reliability: 2 years into it and I have yet had a single problem.  

<b> The Cons </b>

As I mentioned in the beginning, all the good features of my 1992 accord seemed to have become the cons in my new accord. It all begins with the engine...they claim the new VTEC adds power, economy, and driveability. I can certainly say the engine has none of these. To begin with, this is one of the most underpowered cars I have ever driven. It is <i> OK </i> on the street, but it really starts to bog on the highway. Heaven forbid you try to pass anybody on the highway! I tried it once, punching the accelerator at about 65 mph: <b> absolutely nothing </b>. I couldn't believe it: the car made plenty of noise but I was literally inching on the car I was trying to pass. Passing on the street OR highway was a simple matter with my old accord, but you really have to plan ahead with the new model.

Not only does the new engine disappoint, but now you feel detached from the entire car. The steering is soft and unresponsive. The car feels much heavier and lacks any low end torque: it feels more like an 18-wheeler then a small sedan. The seats are much better material, but they are not as comfortable as the older models.

My final complaint is the cost of body repairs. I got in a <i> minor </i> scrape with another car. I was hit by another car that idled into me from behind. The rear bumper was not dented but some paint was scraped off. You would think this would be 100, 200 dollars at the most. Boy did my jaw drop when <b> they wanted $600 </b> !! I would hate to think how much it would cost if you got in a real accident with this car. Needless to say, I'm still driving around with some scraped paint. It is hard for me to believe a minor paint touch up like this could cost $600 (this was at a Honda dealership). This is certainly not a luxury car that requires rare body panels. 

<b> Conclusion </b>

The new accord has improved in some areas, but has fallen behind in many others. The Accord is no longer a cheap, reliable, and fun car that it was a mere decade ago. True, it is closer to a luxury car. But in striving to become one, it has lost its touch. I'm afraid I'm no longer an Accord fan.
