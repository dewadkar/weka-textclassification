            I test drove a Matrix 6sp manual stick shift 2003 with 180 HP engine.  This was my second trip to my local Toyota dealer to check out the Matrix.

<b>Neo Deliver Us From The Matrix</b>  

There are already a number of reviews covering the basic details of the Matrix by Toyota.  So I want to focus soley on my overall driving impressions. 

<b>My Review of a Toyota Matrix- 6 speed manual transmission - 4 Cylinder - 180 Horse Power engine.</b>

   For my review purposes, I test drove three Generation Y cars in a row so I had something to base my impressions on.   

My first test drive was the <b>SCION XB</b>.  My Second test drive was a <b>Toyota Matrix</b> 6 Speed Manual Transmission.  My third test drive was the <b>Chrysler PT Cruiser</b> 5 Speed Manual Transmission base model.  



<b>CLUTCH, GAS PEDAL, STICK SHIFTER</b>

   The Matrix clutch and gas pedal were really solid and were the highest quality of all the cars I tested. (Great tension and pressure in the clutch release.)

   The stick shift was too short and shifting took a little time to get used to.  The main problem with the shifting was finding the gears, they seemed to close together. 

  Shifting on the 6 speed manual required really quick, short intervals and reminded me of a video game.   However, once I got the shifting down, it was actually nice and offered lots of fast response and power.  The shifting is better for long stretches of road and would be a problem in the middle of downtown Los Angeles during rush hour traffic.   I preferred the shifting on the SCION XB a new company under Toyota.


<b>THE SEATS</b>

   The seats are at a great angle and height and I was very pleased with the feel, however, the driver side had limited leg room because Toyota put a foot platform on the left side (Probably because of the front left tire).

   Sport bucket seats are in the front for the driver and passenger, with moderate sides, and are quite comfortable.  One could only imagine that they would be fine for long distance driving.  

The back seats are slightly more elevated than the front seats and offer reasonable leg room when the drivers seat is all the way back.   I am 5'11, with long legs and size 13-1/2" shoe size.   Basketball players will like this car only if they are not driving!


<b>THE BODY (Outside and Inside)</b>


<b>OUTSIDE</b>

   The Matrix has a body style similar to a Ford Focus Hatchback, but is more stylish and modern looking.  It looks especially cool in blue.  I love its curves and lines and imagine that it will be around for a while because of it's unusual and appealing look.


<b>INSIDE</b>

  The Matrix is built very solid both inside and out.  Everything seems well constructed and high quality.  

Behind the back seats is a nice sized storage area.


<b>ON THE ROAD</b>

   The stick shift was too short for the speed that was required to shift between gears.  This baby has got some serious launching power at 180 hp.  If you don't shift fast enough it whines at you.   

Sadly, the engine noise of this vehicle is unacceptable in my opinion.  It was loud during every part of the road test.  Too loud..... I mean, way stinking loud!!


   As I mentioned, I also tested a PT Cruiser and SCION XB back to back against the Matrix.   

The SCION XB had the least amount of engine noise.  

The Matrix was very noisy in all driving settings.   

The PT Cruiser had a really sucky first gear and stalled out on me four times.  Three times while turning a corner, and once while in traffic while returning to the dealer lot.  The sales person at Chrysler blamed me for the stalls, however I have been driving stick shift vehicles for 19 years and none of the other vehicles I have test driven have had this problem.  The problem was in the PT Cruisers clutch for first gear which did not engage the engine at the same height as the other gears, and then instead of easing into engagement jumped in high and stalled out.  Also, while driving the PT Cruiser I kept bumping elbows with the passenger and my toes kept hitting something whenever I took my foot off of the PT Cruisers clutch.  (I wear a 13-1/2 inch shoe size, remember?)

   I was very impressed overall with how much better the SCION  shifted and accelerated when compared to the more expensive Toyota Matrix and Chrysler PT Cruiser.



<b>STEERING</b>

  Steering on the Matrix was really tight and stiff.  It did not impress me at all for a car with power Steering.  However, it offered solid control and did not pull to either side during braking.


<b>NOISE LEVEL</b>

   IT'S LOUD!!! REAL LOUD!

<b>FINAL COMMENTS</b> 

   The Matrix is a beautiful car, has lots of style, is built solid, and gets decent gas mileage.  Where the Matrix fails is in engine noise.  If that doesn't bug you, then consider getting one because they are well priced and come with air conditioning and other cool options as standard.  Also check out the less expensive SCION XB by Toyota, but sold under the name SCION.

<b>Personal Notes</b>

I am currently in the market for a replacement vehicle for my Dodge Ram 1500 pick-up truck.  I have test driven the Toyota Matrix, SCION XB, Honda Element, and PT Cruiser.  My preferences are listed below.

1. <b>Honda Element</b> (2 wheel drive/Automatic)170 hp - Excellent everything $18,000
2. <b>SCION XB</b> (2 wheel drive, 5 speed manual)108 hp - Poor steering - Excellent price at $14,000 (See my review on the SCION XB)
3. <b>Toyota Matrix</b> (6 speed manual) 180 hp - An excellent car that is really, really loud. $19,000
4. <b>Chrysler PT Cruiser </b> (5 speed manual) 130 hp - Sucky clutch, not much elbow room, low ceiling space above the clutch.  Decent noise level, decent steering. $17,000
