            I was in a situation where I needed to give up my beloved Hyundai Scoupe for something with lower insurance rates.  After a great deal of research, I chose the Fox.  I went through an auto broker and found a 1993 Fox with (what I thought was) 27,000 miles.  I owned the car for 18 months and it spent most of that time in the shop.  It would rarely reproduce the numerous problems that I encountered.  I was led to believe that it was a fuel-injected vehicle, but in the bitter cold it would take 20 minutes or more to start (I never encountered that with any other fuel-injected vehicle) and the oil light (and annoying buzzer) would come on thinking it was low when in fact it was full.  With all of the difficulties I had, my father (a mechanic) questioned the mileage as the belts and hoses wore out quickly.  I would strongly recommend that if anyone buys this vehicle that they take it to a reputable mechanic and have a thorough check done.  It will cost you $50 to $100 to have it checked, but it will save the expenses of having it in the shop over and over again.<br><br>
