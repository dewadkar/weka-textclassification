            I recently purchased the CL30 for business use.  There are a couple of things you should know before buying:

GOOD NEWS
The resolution is great in this price range
It comes with all the cables needed to run the camera and jump start your car

BAD NEWS
Agfa should reprice  the camera and sell it ONLY with the AC adapter in the packaging (see lots of other comments about battery use)

THE FIRST TIME I USED THE CAMERA, I DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH BATTERY POWER TO TAKE 15 PICTURES AND UPLOAD THEM TO THE PC!!!

The factory enclosed literature does not tell you the power supply needed for the AC adapter,so you can not go out purchase an adapter

The viewer is &quot;left eyed&quot;.  If you can not wink with your left eye closed, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.  I am left eye challenged and every picture is a mystery

And last but not least, the camera takes a few moments from the time to you turn it on until it will take a picture.  DO NOT ASSUME YOU HAVE CAPTURED AN IMAGE until the number of remaining photos is lessened AND you have seen the picture.  DO NOT, DO NOT expect to take multiple shots in succession
