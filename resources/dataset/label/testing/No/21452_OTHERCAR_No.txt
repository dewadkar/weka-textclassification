            My gf's mother was in the market for a new car to replace the lease end on a 97 Lexus ES300. Perhaps in want to feel 10 years younger, hehe, she decided to look for a convertible. Her first choice was the BMW 323 convertible, but the long wait lines and price inflations made her think otherwise. She let me drive the Eclipse around Miami a couple nights ago with her daughter, my gf, and I can now write a review about this vehicle. 

We must've driven a good 130 miles...highway and street, so I know what the car is about. The exterior is nice. The normal eclipse looks ugly, but the convertible is downright gorgeous. Drop the top, and you might think you were looking at some breasts....well not exactly. But still, the car is beautiful. The chrome gas cover adds a nice touch. The front of the car looks awful though, shameful since the rest of the car looks pretty good. 

The interior looks way too cheap considering the car costed a hefty $28,000. It is the GT with auto, leather, you know...the works. But way too much plastic is used on the dash and the center console. Cheap plastics and cheap accessories are evident throughout the interior of the car. The drivingt position is quite good, and this is one of the view convertibles I can fit in, top up or down, comfortable. I am 6'4&quot;. The cd player eats 4 cds at a time. Perhaps the car's best feature...really.

The acceleration is boring. 0-60 in 7.5 might seems fast, but it just doesn't <i>feel</i> fast. Why drop the turbo??? And the suspension is awful. Even the sheel of a snail is felt if you run over it. The shocks take way too long to absorb even the slightest of bumps. The handling though is incredible. The goodyear eagles are a good match for this vehicle...nicely done Mitsubishi. The top goes down and up quickly, and hooking the top to the body is a snap.

For the money, there are better convertibles...or are there? The offerings from other car companies in the 25,000-30,000 price range are scarce, so perhapsz Mitsubishi is really in a class of a its own with no real competition from a convertible of its size. Camaro and MUstang isn't competition, those are a joke. Perhaps the new Sebring will give the Ecplise some rivalry.<br><br>
