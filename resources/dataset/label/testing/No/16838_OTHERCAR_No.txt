            THE BAD:
I have purchased two CLK's a 99 320 Cabrio and a 00 430 Cabrio. My past cars included various Porsches, BMW, Italian exotics and a couple of used Benz's

The quality control of both of these cars is terrible. The 430 is one month old and today I found corrosion on the radiator support under the hood. The windows are also malfunctioning. The 320 suffers from &quot;Check Engine Light blues&quot; as the light seems to come on at least every two weeks for various reasons. Has happened twice on the 430 with 400 miles and counting. 

The top on the 320 fits poorly and slams down on the top of the windshield unless you catch it with your hand. The 430 does not suffer from this. The 320's cooling fan IS LOUD enough to cause deafness by OSHA standards and is embarrassing in traffic. The 430 is quite. Don't expect to put even a carry on bag in the trunk as it is tiny. The climate control switches are a BIG PAIN. The &quot;Huge&quot; keyless remote has a range of eight feet (On a clear day) 

THE UGLY:
The dealer support for these cars is very bad. (Try to buy a maintenance part for a 430 in the US) The dealer attitude is elitist (I've been to five.) Quoted four weeks today (Miami area) for an appointment to fix the latest check engine light or lights as they are both on this week!

I had one dealer screw me out of the first CLK (Coupe) (In Virginia) I ordered for more profit even through I had a contract and deposit for the car. 

My eventual selling dealer was good and ran a tight ship. (Also in Virginia)

Mercedes wasn't interested in the first dealer situation claiming they had no control over their dealers. MB needs to wake up and set standards for it's dealers and how they treat customers. MB needs a crash course in how to deal with the young professional market their new models are aimed at. 

The younger guy or gal who has just landed that killer job or promotion and walk's into an MB showroom to buy their dream car is going to get a rude surprise...No respect and dealer staff that is too busy waiting for Grandpa or Grandma to buy another used E class.

Be warned that the 430 Cabrio brings out the jealous nature in people. It gets so much attention that It's a target for key scratches and convertible top rippers. The 320 doesn't have this effect.

Im going back for more abuse as I am trying to order an SLR. Im sure this review will secure that I don't get one. 

Buy a BMW the people are nicer to deal with.

THE GOOD:
So, If I hate these things so much why do I own them? Simple, 

Put the top down, turn up the stereo, push the pedal down, Wink at the smiling models on south beach, become entranced by the ride and the car makes you forget the rest.
