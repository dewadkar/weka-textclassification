            I bought my 97 Mark VIII LSC (41k miles) in June of '99, trading in a 1995 Thunderbird V-8.  One of the main reasons for purchasing the Mark VIII was the performance and refinement provided by the DOHC V-8. 

Within 2 weeks of taking delivery of the car, it was back at the dealer to fix the tilt/telescoping steering wheel.  In the process of disassembling the steering column for repair, the upper steering shaft was damaged.  To make a long story short, the upper steering shaft was backordered for 6 months and the car was out of service.  The dealer never did receive the correct part from Ford - they ended up getting an entire steering column out of a salvage car and removing the upper steering shaft.  In the five months since the steering column repair was completed, the car has made monthly visits to the dealer to address a variety of issues including:  warped brake rotors, broken power lock switch, erratic and sloppy shifting (which I have been told is normal), a misaligned drivers door, front end vibration, nosiy suspension air pump and a variety of squeaks and rattles.  There are still a number of unresolved rattles (including a rattling sun shade on the moonroof) and the front end vibration continues despite new rotors and a new set of Michelins.  I have never owned another vehicle that has required so many repairs.

Body integrity and reliability problems aside, I do enjoy driving the Mark VIII.  The handling is suprisingly good for a car of this size and weight and I find the seats to be extremely comfortable.  On good roads the ride is smooth and the stereo is excellent.  The transmission shifts well with either a very light or very heavy throttle - anything in between produces poorly timed and sloppy shifts.

In all, I am actually saddened by the unrealized potential of the Mark VIII.  Although the engine is first rate, the transmission, assembly quality and long term reliability are lacking.  The warranty is almost up and due to ongoing reliability concerns I have little choice but to trade it in.  <br><br>
