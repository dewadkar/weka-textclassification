            I am a car guy, I love cars and I love driving them but I hate to drive this Grand Am. I bought it from a family member as inexpensive daily transportation. When I bought the car in January of 1998 it had only 82,000 miles on it, very low for a car of this age. Less than two months after bringing it home it needed a new radiator and once summer rolled around I discovered that the air-conditioning had stopped working. That is over $400 in repairs in the first 6 months of ownership. I am still in contact with the previous owner and they have stated that it was not the most reliable car for them either. It now has 105,000 miles on it and it is still having problems.

It does not get great gas mileage for a 4cyl and it is very low on power. It seems to have many small things go wrong on a weekly basis. The center console top broke, the head liner is falling down, the cigarette lighter/accessory plug no longer works, the windshield washer fluid pump quit, and so on and so on. It is a rattle trap, every thing squeaks in this car

I am a tall guy at 6'3&quot; and this is a very uncomfortable car for me. The seats were poorly designed and provide very little support. I would not even think about getting in the back seat.

It does have a very nice stereo compared to other OEM stereos I have heard. The original tires that came with the car were also very good and the car is easy on tires. This car has only had two sets on it in its 105,000 miles. 

I would not recommend a Grand Am or any Pontiac product to a friend even though I have a relative who sells them.
