            This must be the worst full-size digital camera I have ever had!

It's bulky size and weight makes it nearly impossible to carry with you. If you are, however, brave enough to attempt it, I strongly recommend purchasing a reinforced carrying case, as I have had the experience with ripped straps on cases form this camera!

The 1.9 Megapixels in this camera looks like 0.9 in another. The photos will look excellent on the LCD screen, but when transferred to a PC or printed, the poor quality of the lens becomes evident.

The fact that the <b>memory card can not be removed</b> is binding to say the least. You are limited to a certain number of photos you can take and if you are not anywhere near a PC, where you can download your pictures and get them off the camera's memory card, you're out of luck! (It's like having a camera with a roll of film stuck in it!)

The workmanship of the camera leaves much to be desired, as well. I had to replace the batteries once, <i>(this thing goes through batteries like you wouldn't believe!!!)</i> and the slider that keeps the batteries in the camera broke. It will no longer close. I've resorted to putting a rubber band on the camera to keep it working.
