            We purchased this vehicle based on all the raves that we had received by people that had owned one themselves.  They told us of the many safety features that surrounded the vehicle, the ease of driving and little upkeep needed on it.  What we did not think of was the space in the vehicle for passengers, and other items.

To begin with, I loved the fact that for me (5'7&quot;), it was easy to drive.  I was able to get in and out of the car with little or no problem.  I loved the fact that the vehicle did have many safety features, the fact that the sides were dent resistant, the 2 airbags and the child safety locks.  During the 2 years, that we owned the vehicle, we had to put very little work into it, other than change the brakes (1 time) and the oil, there was none.

The things that I hated about the car, definitely outweighed the love.  My husband, standing at 6'3&quot;, could not drive the car without discomfort.  His head rubbed against the interior on the roof, and he was very cramped (even in the passenger seat).  We had several complaints about the seats in the back, and I did not realize how uncomfortable they were until, I actually sat back there.  There was no leg room for an adult and the seats, sat straight up, they were not reclined in the slightest bit.  Prior to having my second daughter, the vehicle was fine as far as space, but when my second daughter did arrive, there was not enough room for the 3 kids.  The vehicle boosts that it can fit 5 people (2 in the front and 3 in the back), however with one in a carseat, one in an infant seat and one just in a belt, there was not enough room. The car was only 3 years old when we purchased it, and within 6 months of owning it, basically the entire interior rattled.  I also, hated the fact the car lost value so fast, that there was no way to get out from under it, since it was financed.  Being a 1995 Saturn, full of safety features and such, we expected it to keep it's value, however it lost it's value almost over night.  

Driving the car was quite easy for me, but like I said earlier not for my husband.  He had no space to move and got to the point that he would not ride in it, unless he had too.  It was very smooth to drive.<br><br>
