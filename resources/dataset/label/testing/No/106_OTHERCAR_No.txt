            The Dodge Ram 2500 Pick up, seemed like a pretty good truck until I neared 75,000 miles.  Once I started getting close to 75,000 miles, the transmission began to have problems.  The entire truck would shake, and it was continually getting harder to get the truck into its lower gears.  The truck was a year old when I bought it in 1998, but I think it should have lasted a little longer than that!  The person that I bought it from had driven nearly lived in the truck, but it was in good physical shape when I bought it.  It was by no means immaculate when I took over the title and insurance, but the cab was clean, and showed only signs of minor wear.

Everything else worked great for the time that I had it.  It was comfortable, the radio was decent, and it could haul anything.  The only problem that I had with it was the transmission.  It cost me almost as much to replace the transmission as it did to buy the truck.  When I look for a truck, I want it to run forever.  As long as I change the oil, the filters and the spark plugs regularly, I want the truck to run great.  The Dodge Ram really disappointed me.<br><br>
