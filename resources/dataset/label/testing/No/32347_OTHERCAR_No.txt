            I didn't want a Jetta, but I was only 18.  My dad picked it out because of the great deals Volkswagen had on leases.  I also didn't want to lease a car.  I wanted a nice used car, but he wanted me to have a new one.  So we left the VW lot with a new 1995 Jetta GL with a manual transmission.  I should have reveled in the salesman's politeness a little more, because this was the last time I'd ever get good service from a dealership, even though I'd be visiting dealers a lot...

The Jetta came with a 24 month bumper to bumper warranty, and a 10 year 100,000 mile drivetrain warranty.  I had a few problems in the first 24 months, mostly with minor things.  I drove the Jetta cross country (NC to Los Angeles, CA) to college within a month of purchasing it.  After the 4 year lease was up, I bought the car.  I have a lot to say about this car I have lived with for 6 years.  

The first thing that broke was the rear seat cupholder.  It is sized to hold a large drink and folds out of the back of the console between the front seats.  It's cheaply made and mine has broken twice.  

The Jetta's main problem is with things just like this cupholder.  Other things that are broken or have been broken are the cigarette lighter, the dashboard lights, the anchors for the sun visors, the door to the console, the outside trim, the driver's door lock, the car's alarm, the air conditioning, the AM radio, the tailpipe, and the cruise control.  The car still runs well after ~80,000 miles and it gets good gas mileage.  But I want more from a car, and so should you.

The dashboard lights went out at year 3.  Just out of warranty, how convenient.  It costs $160 to replace them, and I was about to give the OK, but another Jetta owner at the dealer hissed "Don't do it!"  He asserted that his had been repaired and were out again within weeks.  So, I have a little flashlight that sits on the dashboard for night driving so I can tell how fast I'm going. 

The AC went out, also at year 3.  For $820, I could have it replaced.  I was livid and contacted VW about paying for it, but they refused.  The dealer's repairman told me a stick or rock had made a hole in the compressor (or was it condenser, I don't remember).  Well, this hole was so small I couldn't see it when it was pointed out.  But after nearly passing out in July one day, I relented and shelled out the dough.  That's the worst thing that's happened.

The alarm isn't supposed to go off when you use the key to unlock the trunk (like to put groceries away).  Well, sometimes it does.  Mostly only when people are watching you.  Meep, meep, meep!  Right, like I'd be trying to steal this piece of junk. I WISH someone would steal it!!
The alarm has gone off twice while the key was in the ignition.  Once, I was moving and it shut off the engine.  This was scary and embarassing, but when I turned the car off and on, it was fine again.  It only happened twice, but that's twice too often.

Two of the four trim panels on the doors have fallen off.  I always wondered why I saw so many Jettas missing those.  

The driver's door lock came out in my husband's hand when he was opening the door one day.  At least 50% of the reviewers have had the same experience!  I can't believe I paid $60 to have it fixed!!  (This was at year 5).

The tailpipe fell off.  I must credit VW because they paid for this one (year 3).  However, it was still unnerving to have no answer when someone asked where my car's tailpipe was.  I didn't notice when it fell (it doesn't change the sound) and I still don't know what happened to it.

The cruise control is finicky.  Usually it works, sometimes it doesn't.  

The anchors to the sun visors fell off.  Why bother to replace them when so many other things are wrong?  Also year 3.  Year 3 was a bad one for us.

The cigarette lighter doesn't work.  Don't know when this happened.  The AM radio never worked.  I don't listen to it much, but I noticed whenever I try to get traffic reports it just keeps seeking and never stops at a station.   

The car also has about 5 serious rattles in the dash and doors.  It is pretty noisy at high speeds.

The Jetta has shuttled me around for the past 6 years, and driven to California and back (from NC) twice.  It has only failed to start once, when the battery died.  It gets good mileage and hauls around 2 large dogs and lots of luggage when we go on trips.  The tape player never broke even though it was in use any time the car was running for 5 years (till I got my CD player!).  But the little things that are wrong with it add up to big dissatisfaction.  VW doesn't stand behind their product because only one of these problems has been called a recall.  The AC shouldn't break on a 3 year old car.  Pieces of your car's exterior shouldn't fall off on a regular basis.  And the alarm shouldn't go off when you use the key to open the trunk.  
 
Even though my friend with a new Jetta insists these problems have been fixed, I won't get another VW.  VW should stand behind their product and issue recalls for common complaints.  

Finally, the dealers are less than pleasant when you are in for service as opposed to sales.  I have been to 5 dealers (3 in NC, 2 in CA) and they have all disappointed me.  One burned a hole in my seat while working on it and then refused to admit it.  One chained my car up in a lot and refused to release it to me even though I had already paid (a "misunderstanding" about when I'd pick it up).  One ordered a part for me and took payment, but never received the part.  They then refused to refund my payment.  Honestly, I don't know why VW dealers are so horrible.  We take our other car, a Toyota, to the dealer and they have excellent service.  Maybe VW dealers are irritated by the slew of dissatisfied customers coming to get repairs on their Jettas.
