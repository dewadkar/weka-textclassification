            It's not even my car. It's two years old. It's the turbo model and it's got great acceleration turbo style, but I don't think it's too sporty. I don't particularly love the seats except for the heater in winter is nice.  The seat belt has an annoying habit of not retracting on the passenger side and the result is the buckle ends up resting on the little red light there. I've smashed two of them. I went to adjust the rearview one day and  it snapped right off. That's not a joke. 

There's room in the back for passengers, but not a tremendous amount. Probably more than an American car. The hood wouldn't pop on a cold day recently. The stereo is great. The remote key only works when you're close to the car and often requires several clicks. The front seat is not huge. The passenger door had to be yanked to be opened when we first got it. It was sticky. The repair shop didn't fix it even though we brought it in about five times. I think now it is working better. Might have knocked the burrs off.

All in all, I have an 80's Nissan 300ZX that I much prefer and it cost me about 42,000 less.  <br><br>
