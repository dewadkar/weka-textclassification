            Like a lot of Americans, I got caught up in the SUV craze and just HAD to have one. Being a boat owner, I wanted a vehicle that was strong enough to pull my boat around the state, yet nice enough to take on vacations or drive to town.
 So, about a year and a half ago, I purchased a '96 two-wheel drive Blazer that only had 23,000 miles on it. Now I know why it had such low mileage.
Recently, I went to have my oil changed and asked the service man to check my transmission in the process. To my amazement, he showed me metal flakes on an oily rag that were broken off. Hundreds of them. He proceeded to inform me that my transmission could last a day or a year. Well, it lasted a day. Three days after a tow truck came and hauled it away, I was face-to-face with a $1,400 transmission bill.
Then, a month ago, I get a letter from Chevrolet telling me that the motor on my wiper blades is defective, and I need to schedule an appointment to bring it into a dealership. Seems you can be driving down the road and it starts raining buckets and your windshield wipers don't work.
And just yesterday, I received another notice from Chevrolet stating that there was something wrong with my antilock-brake system not stopping on wet or slippery surfaces,and I needed to bring the piece of junk back in so they can install &quot;new software.&quot; This will take approximately 45 minutes, unless it's raining when I take the car in and either my wipers don't work or my brakes won't stop the car and I just &quot;slide&quot; right by the dealership.
Steering the Blazer is not done with the greatest of ease, either. I drive a Ford Crown Victoria at work and just a slight nudge of the steering wheel turns the car in the direction I want it to go. With the Blazer, it's more like driving a truck without power steering.
