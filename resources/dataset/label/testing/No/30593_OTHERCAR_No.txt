            Man, I wish I would have got a brand new on of these, or even a moderately used one.  My green '95 Sportage is a rough little SUV.  I can't help but like it.  It gets great gas mileage for a 6 year old SUV and it starts in hot and cold weather with no problems.  I have a bad personal case with AutoNation in which they sold me a car that I'm pretty sure was in a flood, but that's an extreme.  The good thing I have to say about the car comes from the fact that regardless of the huge amounts of repairs I've had to do, it runs very well.  It has good get up, good mileage and decent power.  The interior has lots of room, (especially head room) and all the controls are within reach and very user friendly.

The bad - The spare takes up what flat storage space in the back.  The newer models have the spare on the gate off the back hatch, but the 95 doesn't.  It's in the way.  The car is LOUD too.  I've had to repair a few windows and such in the course of owning it, but the noise level is far above anything else I've ever owned.  I'm constantly thinking the doors are ajar or the windows are cracked.  The fold down seats aren't super easy and they don't exactly lay flat.

All in all it's a decent used car, but I wouldn't purchase a Kia sportage as a new car.  I'd go for the more sound Suzuki Grande Vitara's for the same size vehicle.
