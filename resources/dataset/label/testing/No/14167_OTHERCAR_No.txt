            If you are looking for a first car that is expensive, unique, and hard to drive, I recommend the Hummer. This 4-door piece of steel is still being made believe it or not and they can be found for now less then $80,000(new)-$20,000(used). It is cheaper to buy a piece of steel at a store and modify it. The experience of driving them is miserable and unforgettable in a bad way.

The 8-cylinder engine produces a lame 190 horsepower to the four wheels, with an acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in just under 18 seconds(that feels like a truck). The engine produces 430 foot-pounds of torque, but that only makes any difference when you are pulling something or going up hills. The car handles just like a truck(slow and bad handling), plus the styling of the 4-door truck is a head turner only because it is a Hummer.

Inside the car, most Hummer's have cloth seats and power windows if your lucky. But overall the interior is a disaster, you have to yell to your wife or friend not because it is loud, because you are so spread out. In the front the cup holder are in the middle over the engine(the engine is far back because of the cooling system)which makes the beverages rattle like a poorly built truck. My only compliment is that the transmission is automatic because it would be impossible with a stick. 

Maintenance is amazingly expensive, and time-consuming. If you plan to do it yourself, you should have access to a garage and truck tools.I forgot to mention the Hummer only gets 13 miles a gallon and has a 42 gallon tank,it costs over $60.00 to fill it up and almost that much in oil and cooling fluid.
