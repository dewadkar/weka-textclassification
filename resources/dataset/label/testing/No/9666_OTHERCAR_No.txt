            I have owned my 97 Dodge Neon for one year. I bought it used. Now I'm faced with not only a blown head gasket, but squeaky brakes, and the need for a front end alignment. It is my belief that these Neons are not only cheaply made but they also require more maintance than humanly afforatble. My mechanic friend told me that he has seen to many brake and engine problems. And 4 of my friends that own Neons are experiencing the same problems. So if there are so many problems with this car, then how come Dodge hasn't recalled their product??? It only seems fair to me. There is no reason for this manufacturer to prey on innocent hard working consumers like us, stealing our money, and cheating us out of nothing. If anyone who reads this feels the way I do email me at ***linnypooh17@aol.com******. Us consumers need to stand up and take action against these pigs.<br><br>
