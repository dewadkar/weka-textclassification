            If you want to learn to be a mechanic this is the car to do it with. I bought a 1990 Shadow for an inflated price (of course) and what a nightmare it has been. The car has sat in the driveway more than it has moved.
It was bought from a reliable dealer that I trusted once. I have had to replace a starter a battery many cables and hoses. All in all that is to be expected with a used car but now the motor is gone as well. The only way that this car will run again is to replace the motor at this point. 
The engine has always raced and sputtered. I am not sure what they were thinking when they built this vehicle? There are wiring problems so that we have had to bypass certain things just to get the radio to work. It has to be charged every season to get the air conditioner to work. We had to bypass a valve in the fall to get the heat to work. I would tell you one good thing about the car if there was one. 
Buyer beware! This is not a valuable buy if you are wanting to drive it. If you want an expensive lawn ornament this is the car for you.<br><br>
