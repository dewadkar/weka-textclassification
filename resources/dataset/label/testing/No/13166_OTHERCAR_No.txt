            Decided to try this vehicle.  Test drive seemed acceptable.

Now that we have ~500 miles on our Outback, here's what I have discovered (with a 1999 Chevy Blazer ZR2 as our previous/main frame of reference):

Gas mileage is a +.  The engine warms up quickly when you need heat on a cold winter day.

The cupholders are so shallow that braking or turning will cause a variety of different beverage containers to fall out and spill coke, pepsi, coffee and water all over you and the floor.

The engine is a poor joke.  There is no power from a start and no torque.  Subaru needs to pull their head out and hire an engineer who can engineer a reliable 6-cylindar.

For some reason, I feel much more safe and sound (and pampered) in my '99 Chevy Blazer.  I'd offer a ride to the Subaru engineers and designers, if I thought they'd be interested in how to make a vehicle...
