            Ahhh,the smell.
My first experience at the Land Rover dealer was the smell of the leather seating, the friendly sales people wearing shorts, and the rich decoration of the showroom.

I took delivery of the 97 4.0 in August. And the problems began shortly thereafter.
A/C problems -two times in for repairs.
ABS brake system -two times in for repairs.
EAS suspension system -three times in for repairs.
Extreme vibration problems -four times, until a factory recall advisory identified a driveline problem.

The frequency of failure has been so great, we treat it as a &quot;local&quot; vehicle only.

To date, the cumulative total days in the dealer garage is: 54 days 
(All work has been performed by the dealership).

The recurring oil leaks began within two weeks of delivery, and continue to this day. Though the dealership in Scottsdale has attempted to correct them on five separate occasions. My eventual resolve was to place a pan beneath it in the garage.

The factory 3yr/42,000 mile warranty expires soon. I expect the rover will too.
