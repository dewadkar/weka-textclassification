            I read lots of reviews before deciding on the Nikon 885 - mainly due to a seeing a number of good reviews (some even claiming it's the best 3MP digital camera available) plus the excellent Nikon reputation (I own a 35mm Nikon which is great.)

On the plus side is that the camera is very small, has excellent features, and takes very sharp photos - everything you'd expect from a Nikon.  My Windows XP recognizes the camera and quickly and easily upload to my PC.  The various pre-set 'scene' modes are great - for example, you can select it to recognize you're taking a picture of a sunset and the picture will come out excellent.

One problem I read about in almost all reviews was the 'red factor' - the fact that basically anything red in a picture is VERY red - bright bright red.  I didn't think this would bother me, but I made a huge mistake because it definitely does - images often look so terrible that they need to be corrected using software - for example, women with red lipstick often look like clowns - yes, it's really sometimes that bad.  It's a real pain since who wants to go through all their pictures and make all those corrections (which, by the way, isn't that easy to do.)

The best indepth digital camera review site i've seen is www.dpreview.com -- one great thing this site offers people looking for digital cameras is the ability to review photographic tests of the camera - I would highly recommend doing before buying any camera.  If you look at the 'galleries' portion of the site, it will give 20 or 30 sample photos for almost every digital camera available.  You can judge for yourself how much you'll care about the oversaturation of red in the 885 photos - look how reds really stand out in each photo - maybe you won't think it's that bad.  Keep in mind that photos taken during the day are better than those inside with a flash.  Red-eye from flash photos is VERY red with this camera because of the oversaturation issue - even with the red-eye remover turned on.

For this fact alone I'd wait until they fix before buying the 885 (unless you're not going to take pictures with red objects.)  I really don't know when they'll fix - I called and spoke with Nikon technical support - they refused to confirm or deny a problem exists, but said 'if there is a problem, it might be able to be fixed with our next version of firmware which isn't out yet'.

The other problem is the battery life is terrible and will cost you a lot of additional money ($12 per battery which will last 90 minutes - yes, ninety MINUTES.)  To avoid this you'll need a rechargable battery - which is fine, but you should include in the price of the camera that you'll need to spend another $100 for the battery charger + battery (which I think is included in their 2 MP 775 camera.)

Oh - and getting this is near impossible since it is back-ordered.  Nikon sent me the rechargable battery, but told me the charger would take a few weeks.  Why they sent me a battery that I cannot charge is beyond me.

I really do like the potential for this camera - I don't want to sound too negative - other than the color it takes great pictures.  When and if this problem is fixed it will be a fantastic camera.
