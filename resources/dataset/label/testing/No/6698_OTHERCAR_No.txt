            There's certainly no calling the styling of BMW's Z3 roadster &quot;conservative&quot; in any sense of the word.  Although undeniably sleek, the Z3 just looks a little too &quot;cartoonish&quot; for my tastes.  The body is full of little bulges everywhere that don't quite seem to come together to produce a harmonious whole, and in fact I believe Mazda has done a MUCH better job with the newly re-styled MX-5 Miata.  It also looks as if the whole cabin is too far forward in the wheelbase, reminiscent of a Viper Roadster, albeit not quite as extreme.

The base model sounds to me like it would be somewhat underpowered on the road, with the 1.9 liter four cylinder producing just 103 kW of power at 6000 rpm.  BMW claims 0-100 km/h times in 9.5 seconds and a standing quarter mile time of 16.6 seconds.  I give the Z3 two stars.<br><br>
