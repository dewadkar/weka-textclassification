            T'was time for a new car and a former love rekindled our attraction for Mercedes.  

Several years ago, I had purchased a low mileage, used 1993 E class for my wife.  A beautifully German car.  The proverbial bank vault on wheels: solid, sure, secure.  The 3 pointed star on the hood said luxury in a refined, subdued way.  She loved it and I did too.  

So, when it was time for a new car, the Mrs. wanted MB.  We looked.  We drove.  We bought.  I never really had a chance.

On paper, our 2004 E320 is spectacular.  In the showroom, it is beautiful in ways our old MB was not.  On the road, it is ... OK.  

Ouch.  

Spending north of $50k for a car should get you more (way more) than "OK".  Unfortunately, I don't think our E320 does.

First, full disclosure:  I most recently leased a 2002 Infiniti Q45.  I LOVED that car and hated when it was time to give it back.  Many people don't even know what an Infiniti is (Nissan) and most people have never seen a Q45 (apparently they only sell 200 or so a month).  I leased the Q because I thought it was an unbelievable value.  For LESS than our new E I had 8 honkin' cylinders delivering 340 HP in a larger car that was, in my humble opinion, every bit as handsome.  The Q had "soul".  It wasn't perfect but it was fun.  Maybe I'm a contrarian, maybe I loved the Q to protect myself from people who said "You bought a what??".  

So, the E?  Nice car, but where's the soul?

The Good Stuff:

- Beautiful car.  No question.  Inside and Out just really sweet.

- Comfy up front.  Great Seats.  Good control layout.

The Bad Stuff:

- Power is underwhelming.  For $50k, don't make me wish I had spent $60k for the V8!

- Brakes are difficult to modulate.  I find myself stopping short or stopping long because the brakes don't stop like you expect them to.  The brakes are effective, just difficult to control smoothly.

- Automatic transmission is annoying.  Now this is a problem with ALL newer cars.  Manufacturers are putting 4, 5, even 6 speed transmissions in new cars - that improves performance and fuel economy.  Some transmissions do a better job smoothing out the shifts.  But the E is always shifting.  I don't like that.

Bottom Line:

The E should last forever.  It's attractive.  It will retain it's value.  Would I buy another... no.  Next time, I will move further up the alphabet, up to Q.
