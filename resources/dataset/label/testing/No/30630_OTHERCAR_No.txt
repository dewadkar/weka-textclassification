            As the first mini-van I ever purchased, the Silhouette appeared to have all the style, bells, whistles and comforts we wanted.  It wasn't long, however, before we realized that Utopia was non-existent in Oldsmobile's Silhouette.  Ours is the 1997 three-door version.  The automatic door still (2 years later) refuses to close each time.  The brakes continue to squeak after being replaced twice.  The automatic windows (in back) don't work half the time (and one of the motors has already been replaced).  Air vents on the rear AC fall out of the ceiling at random and wack the kids on the head.  The seat belts stay twisted; the door panels refuse to stay attached to the door; but wait...it gets better.  The van is two years old, 1,000 miles out of warranty and it needs an entire PISTON JOB $2500 on a $30,000 mini-van.  My Nissan never needed more than a new clutch and brake pads in seven years.

Oldsmobile is dragging their feet.  Cost assistance?  What cost assistance?  The managers won't return our calls.  The service tech we have dealt with for the last two years seems to have forgotten my name.  I have LITERALLY had the van in the shop twice a month for the last 24 months.  Do they provide a rental?  No.  Do they say: &quot;Sorry&quot;?  No.  Do they give a rat's behind if me and my three kids walk or not?  No.  Oldsmobile, in a word, stinks:  The cars are unreliable; the service stinks; the dealers are cheats; and I am in such a bad spot with them that I can't even sell the stupid van.

For those of you who &quot;love&quot; it...just wait.  I loved mine too.<br><br>
