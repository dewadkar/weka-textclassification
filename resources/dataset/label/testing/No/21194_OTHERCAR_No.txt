            I bought this car 3 years ago since to go to work had to drive 100 miles a day round trip so I needed a car with good gas mileage. 42 gallons to the mile was very attractive. Comfort......I don't think so. In long trips this car is a nightmare. Very, very uncomfortable. No leg room (and I'm only 5'4&quot;), no arms room, no room at all. The AC takes too long to cool, but once it does you freeze. If you turn it down it gets hot. No way to regulate it just right. Then in January, before leaving the States for Belgium the transmission broke down. How can a 3 years old car transmission brake down I just don't know. Had to replace the all thing. Cost me a lot of money. Now I know why people buys Toyota's. <br><br>
