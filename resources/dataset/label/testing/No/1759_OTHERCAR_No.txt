            I purchased a 1995 Mazda 626 a few years ago and it gave me nothing but trouble.  The transmission was replaced 3 times before 25,000 miles, all three times it would lose drive until the engine hit about 3,000-3,500 rpm's then it would kick in and spin tires down the street.  I tried to work through both Mazda and the dealership where I purchased it to have the car either destroyed or get me into another car and neither of them was willing to work with me.  All repairs were covered under the original warranty, but the car would be in the shop for at least 10 days each time, 14 days once, and the cost of rental cars didn't make up for it.  Neither Mazda or the dealer would provide a loaner car for these times.  

After just a little research on the internet, mainly at the National Highway Traffic and Safety Association web (NHSTA), and talking to one of the mechanics that worked on my car two of the three times, that the Mazda 626 has a nasty problem with the transmissions.  The mechanic himself told me that they would work on at least two cars with the same problem about 3 times a month.  There have been numerous complaints lodged with various websites about this problem.  The car also drove like it was on wagon wheels, the ride was very substandard for the price of the car, and the handling was not up to what I had expected.  I received a much more comfortable ride from the 5 previous foreign and domestic cars that I had.

The car would consistently come up with squeaks and rattles that I would have to find and fix myself.  The noise level at any speed was substandard, and the seats felt like they were made out of plywood.

I would not recommend this car to anyone just based on what the Mazda mechanic told me and the lack of assistance from the Mazda Corporation itself.<br><br>
