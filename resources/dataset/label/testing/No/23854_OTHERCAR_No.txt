            We bought a Dodge Caravan LE in 1990 and have owned it for nine years. Fortunately we bought the 7/70 warranty which proved to be fortunate. I'll just mention the highlights of ownership. From the start we experienced burned out tail light and brake light bulbs. We were told by the dealer that it was just bad design...that a low current ran through the bulbs all the time and made them burn out prematurely. At about 40,000 miles a chip went out that caused the engine to die whenever it dropped to idle. We took the van in to have it repaired under warranty and were told the fuel injectors were also leaking and needed to be replaced. I told them to go ahead since we were covered by the 7/70 warranty. No they weren't. The dealer pointed out the small print. &quot;Fuel injectors&quot;, we were told, &quot;wear out just like tires or brakes&quot;. Then the transmission failed. Fortunately the warranty covered it. The dealer told me the weak transmission was a known problem. I asked what would have happened if we had not had the warranty. We were told we would have been SOL. At 69,000 miles the cruise control went out as we embarked on a summer trip that would take us over the 70,000 mile mark. Sure enough, when I took the van in after our return I had to write a letter to the President of Chrysler to exert pressure to get the dealer to fix the problem. I was told it was a design flaw since the cruise control servo is located under the battery and gets battery acid on it. At 89,000 miles I took the van in to have a major tune and for replacement of the timing belt. Besides the air conditioner control wasn't working properly. We had to replace the whole heater/AC control panel and also had to have the distributor cap replaced (which houses an expensive microchip). The transmission went out again at 110,000 miles. The shop (not Chrysler) suggested the transmission be rebuilt since they could deal with the weaknesses in the unit that way. If they put in a new unit (cost was about a wash at $1,800) it would be subject to the same deficiencies as the original and its replacement. Both front struts have been replaced as well as both rear shock absorbers. We have been through 22 tail lamp bulbs. As for maintenance I was careful to change the oil every 4,000 miles and get the recommended interval maintenance done. 
Would we buy another Chrysler product again? No!!! We just bought a Toyota Sienna. At Chrysler engineering and quality seem to be forgotten skills. This one Chrysler experience is enough for me. <br><br>
