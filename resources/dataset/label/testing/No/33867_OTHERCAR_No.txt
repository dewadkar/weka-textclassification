            With 4 kids, it was time to get a bigger vehicle.  My husband, who is an automotive technician, liked the Villager best.  We like the way the van drives, quiet and smooth.  It also can tow light trailers.  The inside is roomy and has plenty of storage space.  Our van has the back heater controls which is a must for back seat passengers.  They are comfortable both in winter and summer.  There are also radio controls in the back seat that enable the speakers to be turned off so that headphones can be used by 2 passengers.  We have done a lot of traveling in the van and have used the roof rack, although we don't have the compatible storage bin.  We have a utility trailer that we towed last summer.  It drove nice and smooth.  We enjoy the flexibility of the seats; being able to fold them down and eat on them.  It makes it nice for day trips.  There is a lot of space in the back when the middle seat is out and the rear seat is folded up.  It is nice to drive and there is plenty of visibility all around.  The only thing I don't like is the sloping front end.  It is very hard to see.  <br><br>
