            Never judge a book by it's cover.  I thought the Dakota was a good looking pick-up and heavy duty for its class.  I have a '97 and after a month the paint started peeling off the front bumper.  Brought it in to the dealer,  they repaint it.  After 3 months the paint started to peel again and not only that it was peeling the dealer never bothered to strip the old paint.  They painted over the old paint.  I have a friend with a body shop and he did it for me for a small fee of course.  

At 7,000 miles the shocks are worn.  Everytime I go thru rough roads the truck bounces off uncontrollable.  Bought new shocks,  rides better but over rough roads feels like the truck is swaying from side to side.  It feels unsafe.  Changed the tires at 25,000....cheap Goodyear Invectas.  Changed battery at 36,000.  Now, the rear bumper is peeling at 36,000.

The fan comes and stays on when I'm driving in the morning or just been sitting for 5 minutes and it goes off at a certain rpm but i live with it.  

It's a good looking pick-up.  Interior is pretty good.  Ride was smooth when new.  Now, it's alittle on the rough side.  There are too many cheap parts in the vehicle.  I bought a new car to avoid replacing knick knacks.<br><br>
