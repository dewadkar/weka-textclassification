            I bought a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee (JGC) Limited vehicle for three main reasons: looks, power and price/value.  The only other vehicle that I seriously considered was a Toyota 4Runner Limited.  After 9 months and over 18,000 miles, I would say that I am only slightly satisfied and would caution those considering a JGC.

As far as looks, I am still completed satisfied.  JGC is the best looking midsize SUV out there.  Its front grill projects a sturdy image, but it has been smoothed from the previous generation.  The design integrates all of the elements well so it looks good from any angle.  I appreciate that it is not overstyled using cheesy tactics like body cladding from Pontiac or understyled such as the forgettable design of the Explorer.  Simply put, the well integrated, bold overall look of the JGC still pleases me.

Second, I bought the Jeep for power.  On that front, I have zero complaints.  The V8 is amazing and can outrun most vehicles on the road at any speed, but the most impressive part is the low end torque that allows you to shoot away from stop signs like a rocket.

Third, my problem lies in the price/value ratio.  I paid $31,600 for a loaded, new JGC Limited with the V8, leather, Quadra Drive (4WD with limited slip differential), moonroof, heated seats, Up Country Suspension and 10-CD changer.  All this may sound like a good value at first, and it did to me at the time of purchase.  But, after having the vehicle 9 months, its problems quickly began to surface.

In May, only 2 months after owning the vehicle, the strip of material holding together the fabric on the roof around the moonroof began to detach itself and now sags from the roof across the middle of the car.  When I asked a dealer about fixing it, I was told that they could only push it into place, because gluing it into place would hamper efforts to repair the moonroof should it ever require it.

Another problem that surfaced was that a piece of plastic broke off the rear headrest when I tried to fold it down in order to put down the rear seat for cargo.  I read the owners manual and had put down the seat several times before, so I knew what I was doing.

Finally, the front suspension has begun to creak as of mid-December.  I have never taken the JGC off road, yet the front suspension is creaking!  This makes no sense.  The JGC has received all of its scheduled maintenance (7,500 and 15,000 miles) and I do not expect these sort of things to be breaking so early in the life of the car.  I've owned cars for 7 years that never once developed these tpes of quality problems.

My thoughts on all this lead me to recommend the JGC only as a lease vehicle.  Save yourself the trouble of all these breaking, creaking parts, but do enjoy the great looks and amazing power of the V8 through a well-negotiated lease.  Another recommendation: if you plan to drive the JGC on roads, don't order the Up Country suspension.  It makes the JGC harder to control at highway speeds and induces more body roll around corners than a JGC without the Up Country suspension.  I know this because I rented a 2000 JGC identical to mine for 4 days while on vacation, except that it had the standard suspension and tire package.<br><br>
