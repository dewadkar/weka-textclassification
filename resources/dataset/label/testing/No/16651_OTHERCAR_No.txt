            Today is the 6 month anniversary of the day I bought my Tiburon. I feel that I am now entitled to write an accurate review on it. First of all let me say " I Love my Tibby !", but let me also tell you it is a love, hate relationship. The car itself is beautiful, sporty and sleek, I always get compliments on it's appearance. The inside of the car is cramped, but also nice looking. I don't care much for the factory CD player/ stereo. It skips and gets lousy reception. 

     My Tiburon is front wheel drive and stinks in the snow. I slide around and the brakes become useless, the fact that the car is very light doesn't help. My door locks also tend to freeze up. I have also been having major problems with my sensors. When the heat is on, the air conditioning light comes on, and my engine light has been on and off numerous times. I will be bringing it to the shop soon.


     Other than the few problems I listed ( which I think may be more annoying because my Hyundia dealership stinks and acts like I'm nuts every time I bring the car in ) the car is ok. Its cheap, reliable, and sporty. I like it. I especially like the sunglasses holder which is built into the ceiling of the car. The car also defrosts fast which is a plus in the winter.
