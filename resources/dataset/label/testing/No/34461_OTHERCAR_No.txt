            I bought a Chevy Metro in 99' for commuting purposes.  I drive 20 miles each way, and wanted a car that would't drink all the gas it could.

It that respect, the car performed well, with an average of 38-39 MPG with the manual transmission and aggressive driving.

The car is actually fairly good overall. It's not a complex car mechanically, so there isn't much that can break.  No mechanical problem with the car after a year of driving. Quality was excellent.

It actually provides "peppy" acceleration with the manual transmission.  Unfortunately, the engine noise intrudes significantly, forcing you to turn the radio up louder than you might want.  Never heard a squeal or rattle on bumpy roads however.

Handling is pathetic at best.  It doesn't take much to get the tiny wheels squeaking.  But then again, I usually didn't drive like a turtle.  For average driving, handling is sufficient for safe driving...you just can't push it too much.

The front seat is rather uncomfortable, especially with bulky clothes (ie, in the winter, or if wearing large boots).

A nice feature is that the back seats folds down almost flat.  I was able to haul ladder sized objects in the car with the back seat flat and front passenger seat all the way forward. 

The radio and tape deck worked fine, with decent sound.  All knobs and buttons were well placed and easy to operate.

All and all, I would have probably kept the car, except that in the summer (it gets hot where I live), the AC just can't keep up with the heat.  I had a black car, with black interior, so that probably didn't help...but all the windows had dark tint also.  

This car is probably best for city commuting, where you'll get great mileage.  It's not a bad car to drive.  I actually enjoyed driving it, except in the summer, when it was just unbearable.  In a northern climate, this should not be a problem however.

I recommend this car for city commute, but not for long distance driving.  This car is a cinch to park in a tight spot.
