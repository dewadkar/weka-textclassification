            First let me state that I have purchased many of vehicles over a few years, so I feel I am qualified to give my opinion on this vehicle. I bought a 1997 Chrysler Cirrus (used)and had nothing but problems from the get go! The reason i purchased this vehicle was i needed a family car. The looks where nice,and the price was good. The car was fully loaded and it had low miles. 
I did like the looks of the car and the roomy interior. It all started with an Oil Change, that is when they spotted the transmission leak, then it went on to transmission problems one after the other. After fixing the problem I received a recall notice from Chrysler stating that the Ball Joints and restraint system were &quot;UNSAFE&quot; to drive and to take my car to the nearest dealer to fix the problem. 
Then I was driving in the snow that winter and when I had to brake in the snow the brakes locked up and the pedal began to vibrate and a clunking sound came from the front wheels, and you could feel this on the brake pedal. So I called the dealership to ask if there had been a recall on the ABS System but they had said NO! I beg to differ. I had downloaded off the Internet all the faults found and reported to Chrysler Corp, and there it was as plane as day the recall but they stood by there story!
    After a few months of dealing with this I had come across another problem, the engine light would come on , now keep in mind this vehicle only had 46,000 miles. I took it in and come to find out my bill was 500.00+ to get it out, It was something to do with the computer chip! By this time I had had enough and I tried to trade this LEMON in but the Trade-In value was way under what I had still owed on this vehicle, so needless to say I had to come up with my own money to get out of the worst car I had ever owned!! I really hate to say this but &quot;From now on I will only bye Foreign Vehicles, cause if you want a good dependable car always bye Foreign&quot;!!<br><br>
