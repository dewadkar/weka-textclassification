                My family has owned two Dodge Grand Caravans in the last seven years. And i cant say there were too many positive things about it. In these seven years my family owned a 1992 model and a 1996 model, which we still own today.

   The 1992 model was good at first but then we had major problems with it.  In the four years we had that we went through two transmissions and were on the third.  The van was not beat or abused cause my mom was the only one to drive it at the time.  For a three month span the engine kept over heating and you had to shut off the car for a half hour while it cooled down.  (Yes there was enough oil)  While we were on vacation, seven and a half hour long trip to the beach, the belt broke.  No big deal but when we bought a new belt and tried putting it on the entire belt wheel thing broke off.  Then a couple years later the transmission blew again and rather than getting a new one, we decided to purchase a new van.  And just last week a girl in my class had her 1991 Dodge Caravan blow its transmission.

   For some reason we got another Dodge Grand Caravan, a 1996.  Within the first month the motor for the rear window wiper broke which was like $600 to replace.  Over the next couple of years the water pump broke while taking my sister to college, and the suspension makes all kinds of squeaks and makes creaking noises when going over bumps.  Right now the air vents don't work for passengers in the back of the van. The oil and washer fluid leaked.  And the air condition had to be replaced. And most recently a $900 bill to replace a little motor that controlled the power windows. 

    i wouldn't recommend a Dodge Grand Caravan to anyone because of all the trouble my family has had over the years with two separate vans.  Dodge caravans cannot be trusted to take on long trips away from home.  <br><br>
