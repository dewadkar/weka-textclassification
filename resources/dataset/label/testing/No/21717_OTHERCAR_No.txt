            On paper, the Chevy Cavalier Z24 Convertible that I purchased in the summer of '98 seemed like an ideal candidate for someone looking for cheap open-topped driving pleasure, but it very quickly started to lose it's appeal.  The fact that it cost less than 20 grand, with the seemingly constantly available $2000 rebate has really turned out to be it's best point.  Sure, the top is a breeze to open, requiring only one hand pulling down on a single handle, but the fit of that top to the side windows and it's sealing at the top header had me back at the dealer half a dozen times in the first six months.  And Chevy service is not something that you particularly want to experience often.  Mechanically, the car's been fine over 60k miles, but the 2.4l engine has the refinement of a tractor engine.  It's coarse, and just adequately powered, even with the junky 5-speed a delusional me got the car with. Fuel economy's been good, at around 30mpg average.  The interior's ugly velour seating and gray carpet are cheap and show dirt and wear all too well. I've had this car on a few long trips, and that's where it's best, cruising down an interstate in the summer with the top down and the cruise set, so you don't have to hear (and feel!) the engine.  It's times like this that it (almost) seems worth the shortcomings to own this vehicle. <br><br>
