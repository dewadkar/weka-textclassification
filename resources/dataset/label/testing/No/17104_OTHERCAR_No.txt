            The money you pay for this vehicle is spent entirely on the name.  This is intended to be a luxury SUV.  Huh?  How do you figure?  My previous Ford SUV was more luxurious...

<b>Complaints:</b>
Heated seats.  That's it...the entire list of luxurious items on this vehicle.  The seating is uncomfortable, the sound system is fair at best, not even the simple one-touch up windows.  

Let's talk about size.  If you're taller than 5', forget about sitting in the second row seating.  Unbelievably uncomfortable.  My three-year old could kick the back of my seat when she was only two -- that's how much leg room there is. 

Also, the &quot;blind spot&quot; is horrible.  I nearly break my neck trying to see if it's safe to move over.

While this may seem trivial, another of my complaints are the cup holders.  They're in the most awkward and inconvenient places.  First, there are only two.  One is on the dash to the left of the driver, the second is also on the dash to the right of the passenger.  Therefore, the driver only has access to one cup holder at all times.  Not very practical, especially if you're a Mom carrying around two kids all the time.  And I also want to mention that they are worthless cup holders. Reason being, as soon as you turn a corner, if the cup is any taller than a can, it falls out or comes close to falling out.

Another very small complaint is about the fuel display.  You are given a display that gives you outside temp, miles per gallon, miles 'til empty, etc.  This is a GREAT feature.  However, the fuel display starts blinking FUEL at 50 gallons.  And never tells you how many gallons are left until it's all gone.  Not very helpful or informative.  Yeah, I know -- go to the gas station when it blinks.  But 50 gallons is still quite a lot and there's not desperate rush to get the tank filled.  I know...very small point to bring up, but it's annoying nonetheless.

I've never been one to like my CD changer in the trunk and this is no exception.  It's very impractical and inconvenient.  When I'm driving and decide I want to listen to a particular CD and realize it's not already in the changer, I can't listen to it -- that simple.  Either that, or I stop the car, park, get out, open the trunk open the door to the changer, take the changer out, put the CD in...close everything.  Not likely.  I find that I hardly even listen to my CD any more.  Too much hassle.

<b>Compliments:</b>
Smooth ride.  Safe.  Pretty to look at.  Powerful.

While the look, ride and power are important, they don't justify the outrageous cost of the vehicle.  Safety is extremely important and I will always pay more for this peace of mind.  But these features alone do not make it worthwhile to purchase - at least not for this price.  Mark it down another 10 g's and now we're talking.

Also on the plus side is handling in poor weather conditions.  This falls in the safety category, but I wanted to elaborate on this issue by saying that driving this car this past winter was a breeze.  Handled beautifully and I always felt safe and secure.

All in all, a pretty car that rides smooth.  But is it worth the $40,000+ sticker?  I don't think so.  Don't pay for just a name.  It doesn't always deliver.
