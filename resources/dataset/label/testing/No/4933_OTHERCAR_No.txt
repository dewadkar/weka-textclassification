            When you buy a truck, you expect the rugged &quot;truckness&quot; that the TV spin doctors drum up.  I have got to tell you that our experience with our 1998 Sonoma, that we  bought brandy-new,has been less than pleasant.  After a winter the tranny needs replacing.  Oh, and by the way, read the fine print in the bumper-to-bumper warranty.  Actually we didn't get the actual warranty until after we bought the truck and then found out that there were a few words in the warranty that excluded important things in what GMC considered bumper-to-bumper. We didn't buy the extended warranty
because of the huge bumper-to-bumper hype, and wish we would have. 3 years or 36,000 miles ain't much if you comparison shop.
Anyhow, the truck is like something you would get out of a CrackerJack box.  In my opinion it might look like a truck, but it is more like a toy.
We use it like a truck, which is a big mistake because it just isn't sturdy!
I am sorry to be so negative, but the fact of the matter is, we have had trucks that are 15 years old that were more trouble-free than this little
&quot;hot wheel!&quot;  We waited a long time to buy something new.  Of course, we 
didn't pay as much as some of the other trucks we looked at, so I guess it's our own fault.  But a truck, should be a truck, should be a TRUCK!
