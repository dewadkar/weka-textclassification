            Maybe I'm just unlucky. A few years ago I had a Golf and a Jetta in fairly quick succession. Both were so unreliable I swore no VW ever again. 

However, time heals all, and I was so impressed with the 2002 GTi that I bought one (180HP, Tiptronic). What a gas to drive, great handling, and the tiptronic is great fun. Pretty poor fuel consumption though, the same as my 1998 Chrysler Concorde at 22MPG, and premium gas as well! I guess 180 turbo'd HP from 1.8 liters, and an auto transmission comes with a price.

10 months on, the car is still as much of a hoot to drive, but I am disappointed by all the issues that have so far had to be fixed (under warranty by a variety of VW dealers, and always with good grace). These are:
- Juddering wipers
- Leaking trunk
- Many, many rattles and squeaks (the dealer has been into the dash a couple times now)
- Misaligned headlamps (pointing at tree tops!)
- Warning lights going on and off for no real reason
- Driver's seat runners rattling (and replaced)
- Problems with rear brakes
And the final straw: today the car was towed - the engine warning light came on, the engine went to 3 cylinders, and then what seemed like 2 cylinders. VW emergency roadside  assistance works great though, they had a tow truck to the car within 30 minutes!

I am so disappointed. But I guess not surprised. My experiences of 10 years ago with VW show that nothing has changed. The tow truck man told me today "these cars and Golfs, and Jettas are bringing me lots of business!" It's my last one.

I just traded the GTi for a Nissan 350Z. I got $16,000 for the GTi, so I dropped $5,500 in 11 months, which sounds a lot, but is actually not bad, especially since I got the 350Z for MSRP when they are apparently going for a few $K over MSRP.
