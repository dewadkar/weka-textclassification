                 I bought this vehicle because I was looking for something that could haul around four people in comfort and also have enough space to carry a snow blower or something of that size around occasionally. It's really god at it and the model I got, The limited, is really nice car. It has heated leather seats, a six-disc CD changer, power everything, driver's side seat memory, a very compliant ride and a powerful 3.8 liter V-6. The transmission is smooth shifting, the steering could give a bit more feedback, but hey, it's a minivan and it shouldn't be compared to, say my BMW 325is (which has really nice steering - like you're on rails).  It is decidedly more agile than I thought it would be - parking is a breeze for a vehicle this size. There are plenty or little touches inside like lights for every seat and an HVAC vent for each seat. But, don't buy this car now. Wait for the 2001's, a vastly improved vehicle. If you're looking for a used one though, get this - other so-called &quot;luxury minivans&quot; (read: oldsmobile silhouette) don't hold a candle to it.    <br><br>
