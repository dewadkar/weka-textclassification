            I got this car as a hand me down when I started driving recently.  As a '93 DX model don't expect any of the modern &quot;marvels&quot; such as air bags, automatic anything - just the bare necessities.  Because its engine is not powerful at all it has real trouble going up hills or mountains, especially so when it's fully loaded.  When going down even a small hill it speeds up almost exponentially, and if you're not used to it, it can be quite scary.  Some of the car's positive points is it's gas mileage - I can get up to 16 miles per gallon in traffic.  (With gas prices soaring nowadays, I consider this a real plus.)  Of course, it only needs unleaded, unlike some of the more expensive cars.
I get a really bumpy ride if the road is anything but perfectly paved.  The acceleration is bad, sometimes I feel like I'm going to stop in the middle of going uphill or roll downwards when I try to start moving again if I had the bad fortune of stopping on a sloping hill.  
With all these negative aspects, the car is relatively reliable and maintenence free.  Since we got it, it didn't need any major work done, outside of the normal like brakes, tire rotations and the like.  
People who want a practical car and don't expect much should get this car. It's not for racing, or even city driving where there's constant construction.<br><br>
