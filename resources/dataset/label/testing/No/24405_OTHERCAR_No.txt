            I did not purchase my vehicle; it was given to me by my father, who had kept it either in his garage at home or in a parking garage all the time.  He had put mostly highway miles on the car and had taken good care of it overall.  

There are so many things I absolutely love about my LeSabre.  It boasts good quality leather seats, so much interior room, plenty of trunk room, it handles great in bad weather (rain, snow, sleet, even ice), the ride is the best I've experienced other than a Cadillac, I've not had many mechanical problems, etc.  Overall, the car has not cost a lot in repairs.  

As for my COMPLAINTS, I have several big ones.  The window/door lock/seat controls on the driver and passenger side began peeling down to the chrome (was black painted), and are getting very bad very quick.  I was told by the dealer the entire mechanism will have to be replaced.  The other problem that I have is the paint on the trunk and top of the car began cracking - tiny, spiderweb cracks deep in the paint.  The next thing I knew, the paint began peeling off in large patches (baseball size the largest).  

I am sure this is a factory defect because the car has been so well cared-for over the years.  Of course the company would not pay for the vehicle to be painted; it is very unusual for a company to own up to its shortcomings and Buick is one who would not.

I would have advised anyone to buy a Buick until I had this problem.  I would even had advised them to buy a Buick had the company admitted fault and repaired the paint.  But since they did not and would not accept responsibility, I would have to advise everyone NOT to purchase a Buick.  Everyone would like to see the paint last at least the life of their car, and this one definitely does not make the grade.<br><br>
