            I went to test-drive at a 1997 Kia Sportage because I liked the way it looked, and bought it because the Kia Salesmen (4) tag-teamed me until I gave in.  
I like that the back seat folds down, I like that it's good on gas mileage, I like that it's a 4WD.
I hate that I bought it so quickly.  I have had trouble with it from the start.  The automatic mirror adjuster broke first thing, then the battery went dead and they had to replace it.  After they replaced the battery my stereo didn't work because it has an anti-theft program and needs a code to make it work again....NO ONE knows where the code is for this stereo...I am going to have to get a new stereo (my expense of course).  My back windshield wiper fell off in a carwash.  One of my hubcaps fell off on a freeway and was demolished by traffic.  My Airbag light comes on and stays on for at least 15 minutes after I start my car (talk about nerve-wracking!).
Driving this vehicle is kind of fun.  I haven't done the &quot;four-by&quot; thing yet.
I don't think anyone should buy these vehicles until some &quot;renovations&quot; are done in the designs.
