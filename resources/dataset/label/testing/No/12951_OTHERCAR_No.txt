            I purchased this vehicle originally as part of my company fleet for a salesman. It was the first year for the Malibu and the new body style was my main appeal. It was cheaper than a Ford Taurus LX and our marketplace frowned on salesmen pulling up in a Honda Accord. Low and behold if I had only known what I was in for. You would thing I would learn my lesson about GM after driving and buying cars for 30 years. GM is only interested in one thing and that is pushing vehicles on the public that will make them the most money. From the beginning, problems cropped up with the noisy thud the front bushing would make anytime you hit anything larger than a pebble. Three rounds with the dealer and two new sets of bushings later we finally just accepted the noise as &quot;normal&quot;. As a typical American built engine, the 3.1 is noisy and the transmission whine as it shifts through gears will drive anyone nuts. The engine is &quot;decent&quot; on power, but the gearing is all wrong. Handling is &quot;okay&quot; for an American &quot;mushmobile&quot; sedan. The brakes stink!!!!! Be ready to bear down hard on this baby in any situation other than a normal four way stop!
Since purchasing the Malibu, I converted the car to personal use for my daughter's first driver. It's a pretty cool car with the teens. The audio system performs respectably with good low end (bass). You know these teens now, everything they listen to is heavy on the bass. But, the radio has gone out twice and had to be replaced twice. QUALITY &amp; VALUE, GM, QUALITY &amp; VALUE!!! HELLO, IS ANYBODY HOME? What really scared me about the vehicle was when I perform my first oil change. I have been playing with automobiles since I was fifteen and have never seen anything like this. I jacked the front of the car up to get to the oil plug and filter, placed two jack stands just behind the A-Pillars and set the car down on the jack stands. The doors almost wouldn't open. They were all in a bind from the chassis flex. I would give the Malibu a grade of 'F' in structural rigidity. I am very uncomfortable with my daughter driving around in this car and it will be H-I-S-T-O-R-Y as soon as she completes high school this year. 
And, to put the final nail in the proverbial coffin, this vehicle has lost over 50% of its value in three years. A good investment, ......NOT......! I have learned my lesson. I will never, ever buy another GM product on the basis of value or quality. <br><br>
