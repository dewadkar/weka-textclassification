            I bought this camera knowing that the image quality wasn't great.  But I wanted something I could carry unobtrusively with me when going to social functions or when hiking and sightseeing.  Unfortunately, the camera was good for neither.

Indoors, the camera has trouble focussing under conditions like an evening dinner party (indoor lighting).  With almost all point-and-shoot cameras, you can get reliable focus using prefocussing--not with this one.  No matter what I did, a few pictures would still be out of focus, and that's just not acceptable for social settings.  The flash also was not strong enough to take in even a moderately sized tables.

Outdoors, the camera was a disappointment, too.  While image quality and focussing were better, the camera just is not robust.  It looks durable with its metal exterior, but opening it up shows that it has no seals to speak off--any moisture that gets on the outside will likely seep in and destroy the electronics, like if you snap a picture under drizzly conditions or put the camera down on a damp table.  Any kind of dust would have no trouble getting in either.  In my case, I kept the camera inside my backpack during a hike, never taking it out, but the dampness of the fabric was enough to ruin it.

Perhaps it's better that way anyway--I wouldn't have been happy with this camera anyway.

The camera does look great and everybody asked about it because it's so stylish.  If you want a very pretty accessory for taking pictures occasionally, maybe this one is for you.  For something to take snapshots that you care about, a fixed focal length low-end digicam gives you better pictures, lasts longer, and costs less.  

And much of the advantage of the nifty optical zoom on this camera is negated by the comparatively mediocre image quality anyway, so a fixed focal length camera with a digital zoom may even give you the same zoom quality.
