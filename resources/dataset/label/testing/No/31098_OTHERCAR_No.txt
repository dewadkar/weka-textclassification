            I'll come right out and say it: I am (was?) a Chevy/GMC Man. That said, I'll speak of my experience with the trucks we owned in the past. 

As we do a lot of trailer pulling, we bought our first 1-ton <b>1988 GMC K-3500</b> extended cab in the summer of '88, when the new style bodies came available. We were very satisfied with the comfort and ride, but it was a gas hog (454ci) and had quite a bit of automatic transmission trouble, on top of developing new squeaks and rattles almost every trip after 20,000 miles. We put up with it because everybody that we knew of with a different brand truck had the same problems, only worse.  

In 1993 we traded for a <b>1993 Chevorlet K3500</b> with a L6.5 diesel . Although it was more economical to run, and some squeaks were gone, it still had it's share and we still had trouble with the automatic transmission going out every 40,000 miles. But because none of the other brand trucks were improved even this much, we again traded for a <b>1998 GMC 3500</b> in '97.

Now, I thought, here's the truck we were looking for. Rear duals. Extended cab. Trailer options. Cab interior looks great. Cool looking grille. More horsepower on the L6.5 diesel. Cloth covered bucket seats, front. Compass mirror. Lots of other bells and whistles that come with the Sierra package.

My bubble burst on the first trip. Rear duals spelled a rough ride and higher engine rpm (225R16 tires). The extended cab was hard to access (no 3rd door). It never pulled as well as the '93 and overheated easily.(<i>more = less</i> horsepower?) The cab, though better than our previous trucks, still had lots of rattles, and always had small things to fix that broke. The worst problem on the body are the doors. They are huge, and the hinges, stops, and latches aren't strong enough the do the job they were designated for. If you didn't seriously hang onto the handle when opening it in a slight (midwest) breeze, you almost certainly would hear wind noises on your next trip, as the door was out of adjustment. The latch mechinism for the driver side door had to be replaced at about 50,000. It also had a bad vibration coming through the steering wheel that nobody could cure, even after numerous alignment services. My nephew said if you need a hand massage, just take it for a drive. 
To the credit of GM &amp; Company, the transmission on this vehicle lasted while we had it. Fuel mileage was about the same as our older truck, 15 mpg empty, with no trailer.
When the engine went at 102,000 miles with both heads cracked (just out of warranty, but GM paid half, as we had reported a problem beforehand), We decided: That's it! Time to look at something else. We did some comparing and hopefully came up with a winner. You'll be able to read my report on our current truck later on.
The only person I could honestly recommend this truck to is a true Chevy/GMC lover <i>(Me? Not anymore!)</i> who would, as the saying goes, rather push a Chevy than drive a Ford. To be sure, we never had to push this truck, but it was a disappointment to me, to put it mildly
