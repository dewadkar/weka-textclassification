            My parents recently bought one of these to replace our aging Ford Windstar &quot;because it had more space&quot; as they put it.  I will admit that fact. This van has cavernous amounts of space, but not much else.  I rode in it on an eleven hour trip to Northern California and I was less than impressed. 

The seats were less than ideal for any trip longer than an hour or two, even though my parents opted for the rear captain's chairs.  The high ride height and the decidedly un-aerodynamic shape also combined to create a feeling of &quot;wallowing&quot; down the road instead of driving.  This effect grew almost intolerable when riding in the seat furthest back and I had slight feelings of nausea on more than one occasion.

Chevrolet must like plastic a lot, because they made ample use of it all over the interior of this van.  I on the other hand, think this sort of styling made the interior look quite cheap and unattractive.

The only redeeming quality I have found so far is the sound system, which sounds very good for a factory system.


Final Thought:  Needs to be thoroughly redesigned before anyone should consider buying one.<br><br>
