            I bought a Hyundai, righ off the show room floor.....Big doors opened and off I drove in my New Elantra.  They have all the bells and whistles and the price is right.  

Then I move to the snow country and was not doing city driving.  This was a big mistake, I should have sold it the first winter.  I spend most of my time hi-centered or stuck in the ditch.  The next winter my husband gave me the Jeep to drive and he took my car to Valdez, Alaska.  Not a good idea.  He spent most of his time getting rides to work after the Elantra headed for the ditch again.  

The front wheel hubs under the car fill with snow and you can no longer steer the car and it just goes in the ditch and you can not keep from going there...

I now own a Jeep Eagle Summit and someone else has my Elantra. They just called the other day to see if I had any trouble with it in the snow...<br><br>
