            I sold my Sony Mavica73 and ran out to buy the 3.3 mega pixel Kodak and was astonished to find that the Sony took better quality pictures! Plus the rebate I got from the internet ended up being the wrong CAT# for my camera. Also the battery only lasted an hour and took 10 hours to juice.
The flash card that was included only held ONE picture! I thought I got a good deal,but after getting extra batteries and flash cards ,this would be a rip-off. I am very disheartened about this purchase because I had such high hopes for the increase in pixels! The camera did take great scenery shots but really bad close ups and portrait shots..and you can't get very close. I fooled with all the controls to try and produce a better picture and got some success as far as color and light ,but no improvement in the jags. Oh yes, the software would not come up after loading. I did get the 'viewing software to work,but that was all.I'm taking this baby back and trying a Canon that everyone here seems to agree on.
