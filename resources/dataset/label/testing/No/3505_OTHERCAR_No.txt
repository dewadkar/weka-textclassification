            I purchased a pre-owned 1997 E420 Opal Green MB with 60,000 miles.  I am at 82,000 miles on the car.  The "Check Engine Electronics" sensor light gave me problems in the very beginning and I was afraid I had purchased a lemon.  However, there was a recall in place for this problem that dealt with this issue.  My car was still under 30day warranty and the dealer(not MB dealer) fixed the problem a $60.00 part.  Something to due with analyzing the gas and purge emission.  Was not a big problem.  After adding 20,000 miles, the light never came back on. Another sensor light appeared on the dash board screen "Lamp Defective" I thought I was having serious electrical problems but the marker light on both sides of the car, one bulb went out.  A simple bulb replacement.  I experienced a power steering leak after adding 20,000 miles.  I took it the MB dealer in the Maryland area after paying $500.00 for an E-Service package and was informed that there was a leak after I ask them to check because I was hearing a wheezing sound when I turned corners. They were not knowledgeable. I was advised to just keep refilling power steering fluid if I did not want to pay the high price .  I took the car back were I purchased it and they knew more about MB then the dealer did.  The mechanic showed me the leak, which was coming from a cooper ring.  He tighten the ring and I have never had the power steering problem since. In addition, the driver side seat recline position stopped working.  My mechanic said there are 4 motors in the seat and one may have died.  There should be a way to override this for safety. Another problem with the driver's side mirror does not heat fully.  Crap!!
