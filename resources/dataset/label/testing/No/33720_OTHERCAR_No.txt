            My first clue that this was going to be a bumpy ride was when my mechanic called it a Mercury Mistake. He said that Mercury had combined parts from Mazda and Ford, shook it around and came up with this car. I too, had been impressed with the "New World Car" concept. I bought it used, and like others, I had thought, at a very good deal for the price that I had paid. Like equipped Hondas and Toyotas were many thousand dollars more. It had been whacked around some--new struts in the back--my mechanic switched out the whimpy Merc spec struts for Mac Phersons. OK, got the abuse taken care of and treated it like the baby I thought I had. Mona (her name, as in "I'm Monna'n at the car repair shop") threw oxygen sensors for sport, near as I can tell--2 a year at $300+ a shot. When she worked, she was a lovely thing to drive. Unlike others, I was totally embarrassed by the exterior design--looked to be designed by Rubbermaid, but inside, she was a wonderful thing indeed.

Next really major spooky thing happened when I noticed that the front was wobbling in an odd way. This was about the middle of the Firestone/Explorer recall--close inspection, the tires were delaminating. My mechanic discovered no tire issues, but rather the wheel had vertical shearing--it was falling apart--Ford said no recall, but to get the electrical system recall taken care of. Wheels falling apart? Yee ha!

The careful reader may note the tense that I used to describe Mona. Yes, at 113K miles, and after much love and many, many dollars, she, in her Swan Song has thrown a rod. I am now deciding now if I'll have it junked for cash or take her flaming through a Mercury showroom screaming abuse for my Fifteen Minutes of Fame. Watch your local news, just in case. ;-)
