            Besides the fact that this car looks good, there is nothing positive I have to say about it - or any other Chysler cars.  First, the biggest problem this car has is the weak little 2.4L four cylinder motor under the hood.  Not only does the motor lack guts, it has unacceptable levels of vibration - especially at idle.  It is noisy when pushed and basically just makes noise rather than moving the car.  I don't particularly have a problem with 4 cylinder engines - just American 4 cylinders.  Compare any US built four banger to a European or Japanese one and you will feel the difference.  Euro and Japanese fours and smooth and powerful; they also have no problem revving high.  Just compare the Chrysler motor to the VW/Audi 1.8T or any Japanese four - especially any Honda motor. 
Now, the really pathetic fix that Chrysler has come up with to fix the lack of power is to simply bolt a turbocharger to the 2.4L since they are unable to fit any of their V6 engines under the hood.  Not that I hate turbos, I actually like them - but the motor is the same junky vibration prone thing with a turbo added on.  The motor itself is the problem.  Chalk one up for Chrysler engineering.
Another pathetic thing is that this small 4 cylinder is not even that fuel efficient - especially when compared to its Japanese competitors.  
Go figure.
The transmissions are terrible as well.  The manual 5 speed has bad gear ratios - especially first gear since it is way too short.  The optional automatic is even worse, since it gets confused easily which results in shifts happening too early or too late.  It also hesitates between gears near the shift points at times which is annoying.  Another downfall with the auto is worse fuel economy and worse acceleration times.  There is also a maddening driveline whine sound at certain speeds that is enough to drive a person crazy.
The brakes are Chrysler specials - undersized rotors/pads, rear drums, ABS optional, resulting in horrible stopping distances and pedal feel.  
Handling ability is very questionable since this vehicle is top heavy and has the same econo-car underpinnings as the Neon.  It doesn't inspire confidence so playing around on the ess-bends outside of town is not an option!!!    
The interior reflects Chryslers cost cutting initiatives.  While the dash design is interesting (nice metal-look dash panels which mimic the exterior paint colour), the centre stack is again straight out of the Chrysler parts bin with respect to the radio/HVAC system.  The placement of the power window switches between the air vents is absolutely unintuitive.  The drivers seat gets an inboard armrest - but the passenger seat doesn't - how stupid is that??  
The interior seating can be removed - much like their minivans and makes it easy to carry different kinds of cargo.  Their are multiple storage areas and the rear tray shelf is a good idea.  
Just like every other Chrysler car on the market today, there are a variety of option packages and a couple of models (base, Limited) to accommodate most buyers... but they rely on looks and &quot;luxury&quot; features to make the sales.  There is no substance to the cars, and quality of materials/components and build quality is non-existent.  Do yourself a favour and seriously think about the quality issues Chrysler has... it does not have this reputation for nothing! Nothing has changed with American carmakers - they are still very much behind the Japanese and European competition no matter what they claim.                <br><br>
