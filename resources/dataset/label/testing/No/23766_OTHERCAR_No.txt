            I purchased a Saturn SL II in '92, just after the car debuted. At first I loved the car, it was great...but then things started to happen to it. the driver side door lock would not work from the outside, the car began to rattle all over the place, the stereo is full of static, and it burns oil. The car is only 7 years old, it should not be burning oil yet. I am very disappointed with GM on this one. usually I don't by GM products, but I figured I would give them a chance with the new car line. Big mistake, this car has been nothing but trouble, and it is on it's last leg here. In short, don't buy a Saturn, better yet...don't buy GM.<br><br>
