            In the two years that we have owned our Elantra, we have had one major problem a year. The first year the transmission failed and had to be replaced. Thankfully, we had had the transmission fluid changed recently, or that would not have been covered under the warranty. Six months later Hyundai issued a recall on their transmission. When I went to get the car inspected this year, it failed. It had a leak in the manifold up next to the engine.This was also covered by the warranty. However the car was at the dealership for almost a week and we were left stranded. The warranty in the trunk that states if your car cannot be fixed within 24 hrs they will pay for a rental is false. We learned this is in fact only if you buy an extended warranty from a different company, this was not Hyundai's. 

In addition to the major problems with the car, we have found that the older the car gets the more noise it makes. Upon trying to trade it in, we were told by a dealership that he could almost guarantee the car was not worth what we owed on it. So we would never get pay-off on trade-in. 

So I sit here waiting for the next major mechanical problem and hope some day soon I will be able to get rid of it.
