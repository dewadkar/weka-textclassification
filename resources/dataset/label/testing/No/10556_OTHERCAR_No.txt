            When we bought our minivan we thought it could handle more than 7 
people comfortably.  We were disappointed.  We found that it had a good turning radius; good mileage.  Once the odometer turned over 65000 with regular servicing major things began to go wrong. (i.e. transmission failure; blown gaskets; exhaust system needed replacing,)  We wound up purchasing a GMC van as it was able to easily seat our family of 8; and had a better servicing record and warranty.  It was a good van up until the mileage stated above.  Would we purchase a Voyager again?  No.  The GMC van allows us more run; more durability; more cargo space and all wheel drive.  We paid 4,000 less for this van than the Plymouth Voyager.
