            The two door feature helps when you have kids climbing in and out of the vehicle.It has enough seat belts to fit seven people but the leg and cargo space are still huge. All of the back seats can be slid back and forth or can be taken out.The seats are on wheels so after you disengage their locking system they roll out easily.  It comes with the durability of all Chevrolet vehicals. The seat are interchangeable so you can put the three person bench seat in the middle of the van and have a huge cargo space in the back with only giving up two seats. It comes with a 9 speaker sound system. The only problem with this mini van is that they do not offer it in 4 wheel drive.This Van is a must have for all families with two or more kids who need space and love to travel by road. The trunk on this van is great, it is spacious and can be adjusted easily space wise by sliding the seats forward.
