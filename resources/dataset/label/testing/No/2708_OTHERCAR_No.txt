            I purchased my C-1500 Silverado extended cab in the fall of '95, upgrading from a S-10 reg. cab pickup.  I wanted more cab space for employees and was impressed by the large number of these vehicles on the road.   I wanted a 4x4 model, but the price was just a little out of my reach at the time.  They were very popular so discounts were small on the 4x4's back then.

I used the truck to tow a trailer at work and also as my personal private use vehicle.  As a tow vehicle, it was perfect. The 350 V-8 was powerful and reasonably smooth for that time.  One drawback was the long wheelbase and the resulting problems parking the vehicle, but that's the case with any large truck.   I sold this truck after two years because even though it got the job done, there just wasn't any &quot;fun&quot; to owning this truck.  It wasn't particularly attractive in 2wd guise, being somewhat of a &quot;lowrider&quot; due to it's small tires and Chevy's refusal to raise their 2wd trucks higher off the ground.  It just looked out-of-balance to me.  I also was tired of the very wallowy body roll in turns as well as the really poor braking ability.  When towing a trailer, this becomes a serious problem.  The brakes operated fine, but they were just too weak for the weight. 

The interior on the C-1500 was comfortable and very spacious, but the bucket seats suffered from an exaggerated amount of padding in the middle that made you feel like you would just roll right out of them in a turn if you didn't grab your armrest.  It was functional, but again, nothing special.  Entry to the rear was difficult, since it only had two doors.  Then again, I rarely had to get back there.   The stereo and HVAC controls were good.  No real complaints on the other interior bits.

Reliability on my truck was perfect. Zero problems in 28,000 miles.   This contrasted to some of the problems I'd heard others having, but then my S-10 also was perfect in the 50,000 miles I drove it.

Handling and braking were, as I mentioned before, real weak points.  It was a late 80's design and drove like it...very trucklike.  Fine if you're aware of its limitations, but inferior to new models coming out in the late 90's.  One thing that bothered me about Chevy trucks was that despite their long production run and paid-for tooling expenses, they refused to lower prices to make it a better bargain.  My attitude was that I could have a better truck for less money, so why not change?  Ride and noise were good for a truck, but not as good as newer trucks that have come out since then.  

Styling is subjective, but I never got excited about my truck's looks.  15&quot; wheels on such a large truck just don't cut it.   The boxy but not too boxy  styling is classic, however.

Resale value is fantastic on Chevy trucks.  This is probably their strongest point.   Normally, owning a new vehicle for a short time means steep depreciation, but I sold it for only $4,000 less than I paid for it after two years of use.  This was one reason I didn't buy a used 4x4 model. They just wanted too much for them.  

Overall, my chevy was very good functionally, but it lacked the refinement and fit/finish of trucks by Toyota and the new Fords.  For pure work use, a used model might be a good choice, but with superior models out there, you should make sure you get a good deal on it.

If you want crisp handling and braking, avoid this truck.  If you want a conservatively styled pickup or one for purely work use, it'll do the job fine.
