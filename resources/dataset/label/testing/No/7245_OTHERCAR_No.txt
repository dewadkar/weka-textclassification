            Having read the many favorable comments concerning the 1999 Cougar, I'm compelled to offer another view. We (actually, my wife) loved the Cougar at first sight, and bought one when they first came to market in June, 1998. About a year later, the alarm started going off whenever we locked the car. Because it was unpredictable, we never knew when we would be interrupted by the beeping horn and flashing lights. People in her office eventually got used to it. Ford engineers, however, could not figure out the cause. After leaving the car at the dealer on several occasions for up to a week at a time, they finally said, &quot;Don't call us, we'll call you.&quot; Since November, 1999, Ford hasn't been able to fix the problem. In addition, the radio also goes on and off at will. The lease runs out in a few months and we plan on buying an Eclipse to replace it.The Cougar is a sharp looking car, but it's unfortunate that Ford can't stand behind their product.  <br><br>
