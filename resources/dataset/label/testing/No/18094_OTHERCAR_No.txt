            Whatever possessed me to buy a Neon, I will never know, but on reflection, it was perhaps not one of the worst decisions that i ever made. Definitely more comfortable than the 1996 version, you won't have any problems with long journeys, however performance is perhaps less than satisfactory.
     The Neon has a good fuel consumption (35miles per gallon), so for a family runabout, it is not too bad, but for a boy racer (like myself), this car is definitely a big no - no.
     Young people wouldn't really want to be seen in the Neon either, as it has a general reputation as being an old peoples car.
     However security is something that i cannot complain about, as the Neon comes with a Thatcham approved alarm and immobiliser, which will definitely stop anybody from breaking in to steal the tacky hi-fi.
