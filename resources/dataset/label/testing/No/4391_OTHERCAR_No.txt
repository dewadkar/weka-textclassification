            UPDATE:  At about 50,000 miles, my SRS light came on.  My airbag module was shot and needed to be replaced for about $500.  At 72,000 miles, a gasket broke and I lost all of my oil on the way to work.  I now am up to 96K and getting a new car.  I'm scared of Honda.  I'm afraid of what will happen next and what it will cost me in repairs.  Also, the middle seat configuration (seats 3 across) has proven to be a problem.  I transport several teenagers at a time, and they just can't seem to figure out how to move the seat out of the way.  They fold the seat back down and climb over it, and I'm constantly reprimanding them.  One of these days, someone's going to put a knee right through the seat back fabric.

My original review:  

After owning a Dodge Caravan for several years . . . and putting a few thousand dollars into it, including a transmission 7,000 miles after the power train warranty expired (!!!), I decided to rid myself of the problem and go Honda.  Everyone I talked to said Honda and Toyota were the only cars to consider these days.  Own a Honda now, and you'll still own it 200,000 miles from now.  That's what they say.

I was truly impressed when I checked out the 1996 Honda Odyssey.  Oh, I checked other products, but the American minivans still felt like trucks, and the only other brand that came close to fitting my bill was the Nissan Quest.  I purchased the Honda.

Now, I'm no so sure that this was the best action to take.  In the first place, I purchased my Odyssey with 28k, and at 36k the warranty expired.  At 42K, I started having trouble with my door locks -- they would "cycle" when I locked the doors from the outside (went click, click, click, click for a few seconds before actually locking).  I also heard a faint "ping" when I rolled up the drivers window, only sometimes.  I brought the car to the dealership, and they said the whole window and lock mechanisms were shot and would cost $800+ to repair!!!  It took a lot of screaming about how windows and doors don't just "wear out" at 42K, and why do people say buy Honda if things like this "wear out" at 42K, before they agreed to split the cost of the repair with me.  I was not happy.  Needless to say, I'm also scared of what's going to happen next.

The best thing about my Honda is the doors that open like car doors!!!  That was one thing I couldn't stand about my Dodge, the sliding doors.  In the first place, there was only one on my Caravan, and it was always a fight between my girls about who was getting in first.  Plus, the door was too heavy for them to open and close.  I also love the third seat which drops right into the floor, giving me incredible cargo space.  

I'm not thrilled with the way my center split bench seat folds up to allow passengers into the back seat.  It's too cumbersome, and you have to slam it into the floor to lock it in place.  While I love the view from the back because of the "theatre style" seating (each row of seats is progressively higher-set than the row before it, giving all passengers a view out the windshield), I find that anything that is on the floor of the van finds its way into the front, and sometimes things slide under my feet while I'm driving, a definately hazard.  While I think the back-seat air conditioning is the best thing since sliced bread, the heating and defogging system leaves something to be desired.  I'm usually fine, unless there's another person in the front seat having conversation with me.  On a cold winter's day, the windshield will fog up, and it's a battle to defog it.  

So, I have really mixed feelings about my '96 Odyssey.  There are certain features I am really pleased with, but I'm not in love with my van.  Maybe if I do reach 200,000 miles with it, maybe THEN I'll be thrilled!
