            In Nov 1998 i leased my third and FINAL cadillac. It was the most expensive car Cadillac makes and what i thought would be a great car. Well, much to my surprise my new 1999 Cadillac Seville STS turned out to be my worst nightmare. I have had it in for over 40 repairs since Nov 1999. Mercifully the lease comes to an end tomorrow...Fri Nov 24th, 2000.
In fact....this car broke down not only in Cincinnati Ohio where I live but also in Myrtle Beach S.C. and Clearwater Fla. The car was sooooo bad that i went to Cadillac and complained that during my 2 year lease that i would drive it 60,000 miles.......i paid for 60,000 miles up front. I told cadillac i wanted them to extend the warranty on this unreliable car to the 60,000 miles rather than have the warranty run out at the normal 50,000 miles. After reviewing the situation they agreed and extended the warranty an additional 60,000 miles. Part of it was also the dealership i was dealig with ....Camargo Cadillac in Montgomery Ohio. Several items had to be taken back because they didnt fix it properly the first time.
The last time i was there for a simple oil change they disconnected something causing the Check Engine Light to come on before i even left the dealership.
If u are looking for a comfortable ride, stylish car with a fast responsive engine buy this car.......if u want a reliable car....buy a honda !!!<br><br>
