            We bought this car because the price was something we could afford.  It was also the only small car that we felt had a lot of inside room, the other cars we tested we felt cramped up inside.  
We bought a 1995 Plymouth Neon, New.  Within the first 3 months the car was in the repair shop.  The first major problem we had with it was the  head gasket.  Luckily the car was still under warranty and he we did not have to pay for this.  I also noticed when I took it to the repair shop, that there were A LOT of other neons there for repair.  
Within a year, our car was back in the shop again for a new head gasket.  This time it was not under warranty.  Costing $1600 to repair.  
In another 6 months is was back again, another $1600.  And so on.  The car as been in the shop for the past 5 years for the SAME problem, the head gasket.  Each time $1600.  The problem (we later found out from another mechanic) was not just our car, But every 1995 neon.  The company did not make the head gasket right and it would always keep going bad.
The transmission has also had to be replaced 2 times since we bought the car.
This car rides very low the the ground, making speed bumps really uncomfortable.  
I must say it seemed to hold up very well in the few wrecks it has been in.  I expected to get out of the car and see the whole front end crunched in, Yet to find it was not all that badly damaged.  It held up pretty good as far as a wreck.  
We still own the car, as it is not paid off yet and we doubt we could ever resell it.  
Currently, the inside truck opener does not work, the fans do not work, the head gasket is blown and transmission is going out again.
Overall, we spent aprox. $13000 buying the car, and have spent atleast $13000 repairing the car.  
So beware of 1995 neons!
