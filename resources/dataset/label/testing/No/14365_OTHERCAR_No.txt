            Yes, it is true.  I saw some show on MTV that sent a camera crew to follow the comedian Chris Rock around, and he showed off his Altima to provide evidence that he tries to lead a normal life.

Well, the Altima is just that...normal.  Nothing about this car makes it stand out in any way.  It's not bad, though.  It is basically a good value at 16 or 17 grand.

Things I liked about this car:

- Excellent fuel economy 
- Adequate headroom/legroom for driver and passenger
- Good trunk space for a smaller car


Things that bothered me:

- Road noise is not kept out very well.
- The radio is cheap, the preset buttons small and recessed, making them hard to flip between quickly.
- The passenger side has no keyhole.  Why manufacturers are picking up on this trend is beyond me, as it can be irritating.
- Felt like driving any other midsized japanese car.
- The controls in general take some time to get used to.

So, if you're trying to keep a low profile and aren't really into cars, this car is perfect for you!
