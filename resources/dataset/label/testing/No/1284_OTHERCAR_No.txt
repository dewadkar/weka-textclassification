            The CoolPix 990 is a lot of camera for a lot of money.  Whether it is a good value is another question.  I have been shooting 35mm as a hobbyist  for the last twenty-five years, and like many others, have been checking out the digital units on the market. The 990 is my first experience with a digital camera, luckily purchased for use at work.

Once the first of many sets of non-rechargeable AA's was loaded, I was able to take point and shoot snap shots around the office with no trouble.  Auto mode works great for simple vacation type shots.    It was after I tried to take some more challenging photos that I had to pull out the instruction book for help.  The controls take a bit of time to learn, and I still find the book necessary for occasional reference.   The camera has many options for non-automatic shooting.  Unfortunately, the options must be accessed through the viewfinder menus making setting each shot a production by itself.  For someone who is used to setting 35mm exposures, this system is agonizingly slow.   Plan on using this camera for still life...trying to catch an action picture requires starting the shot at least a second before you expect your action to occur.  And that is after you have changed all the settings via the menus.  Again, it may not be fair to compare current digital fare with a competent 35mm camera, but at these prices, it should be a consideration.

Once I got the settings where I wanted them, including the manual focus which is nice, the 990 took very nice pictures.  I printed some 8x10s from the 990 and found them  comparable to 35mm.  

I especially like the quality of back and side lighted macro shots.  The macro capability of this camera continues to surprise and please me.  I use it for documenting tissue samples in a lab setting.  With careful manipulation of external light sources the detail is suitable for printing and even projection as a slide.  

Color rendition was right on for outdoor shots.  The white balance adjustments never seemed to adequately compensate for indoor lighting conditions. 

What was Nikon doing when they designed this flash?  Red eye on every picture!   Indoor shots with flash produce very mixed results.  Most underexposed.  I understand there is a firmware problem with this camera that requires a manual reset on flash to compensate.   The flash is also very small making it useless for anything but close work.  Most of the time I turn the flash off and use available light with good results.

The digital viewfinder does display a lot of information. Again, keep that instruction manual close by at first.  Pictures that look perfect in the digital viewfinder look as much as 3 stops darker when viewed on the computer.  I haven't gotten to that part in the instruction book yet.

The ability to transfer images from camera to PC via the USB cable is a plus.  It installed easily and has worked well.  This system is fast, and I have yet to use the card reader bought with the camera for image transfer.  It's much easier to plug in the USB cord.


I find the power consumption unacceptable.  Sure, you don't have to buy film and process it.  But that saving is quickly offset in batteries.  Even upgrading to lithium batteries doesn't buy that much more shooting time.

I'm glad I didn't buy this camera for myself.  The pictures are nice, but the hassle required to get good technical pictures takes too much time and effort.  I'll wait a while longer before jumping into digital for myself.
