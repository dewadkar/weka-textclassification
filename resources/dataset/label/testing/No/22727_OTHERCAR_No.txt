            I bought a used '93 Grand Am SE Quad 4 with less than 20,000 miles on it.  Less than a year later I received a letter from Pontiac that the head may crack.  Well it did.  I'll admit, they replaced it with no hassle & extended the warranty to 100,000 miles.   Also within the first year my power locks became a problem.  The drivers side will lock everything but not unlock.  The passenger side will unlock everything but not lock.  The lighter shorted out.  I don't have power windows (by choice because every car I ever had with power windows somehow broke), but the driver's side window mechanism is broke.  You can roll it down, but have to pull it back up by hand. (A very real problem when its raining and you can't get a grip!  LOL)  Also, for reasons unknown to me, the floor is constantly wet.  I mean SOAKED!!  THE CAR EATS BRAKES!! I spend an average of $300 per year on brakes.  The car also needs to be aligned quite a bit.  It seemed like a good buy when I bought it- good power and nice looks-  but looks can be deceiving!!  It's very annoying to have all these "little" things break. The only good thing is that it's still running with 170,000 miles on it.  The transmission & engine have been fine.  It's the cheap interior and bad brakes that really bug me the most.  The car has been very reliable but I'm always worried about what's going to break next. Oh yes!  one more thing!  the blower for the heater and the air conditioner is basically non-existent.
