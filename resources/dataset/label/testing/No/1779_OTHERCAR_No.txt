            I bought this car off my sister.  I needed something dependable, yet sporty and fun.  I have been recently divorced and up until now I was driving a mini-van.  Well, sporty and fun do fit this car entirely!!  Steering in comfortable, and ride is good.  But, having a convertible to let your hair down on those sunny days is just plain AWESOME.  The car has very nice styling and is easy to maintain.  After three years and only 28,000 miles, some things tend to wear.  The rear defrost isn't working and the passenger window doesn't always go down.  And there seems to be a minor electric short noticable when driving over bumps (the reading lights go on.)  No car is perfect and I could get this very minor things fixed, but they add to the character of the car.  I have gotten many compliments from riders on the car and I highly recommend it to anyone.  I just wish that there were many more sunny and warm days here in the Northeast to be able to enjoy the car even more!<br><br>
