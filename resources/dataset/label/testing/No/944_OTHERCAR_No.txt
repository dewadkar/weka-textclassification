            I must admit when I first bought my Kia, I was truly excited.  It was shiny, clean, and above all else-it was NEW!  Of course I was comparing it to a 91' Geo Metro, which was by this time falling apart.  It was so quiet and easy to drive.  Parking was a breeze.  It zipped me all over town.  I was in total love.

However, then came my first long trip to Tennessee.  It was great on the ride up there.  Great gas mileage.  Cool air conditioning.  Nice stereo reception.  Unfortunately on the way back to South Carolina, the temperature gage decided to go out.  I was between hickville and nowhere!  I was able to ease it over to the edge of the road and drive it until I found a gas station that would fix it.  Cost me 40 bucks!  It was amazing!  I hadn't had it 3 months and this had happened.  I only hoped my luck changed, and quickly.  It was still under warranty, but it took me almost 6 months to get my money back from the dealership.  I was just glad that it hadn't cost me more to get the car fixed and that I found a station that fixed Kia's.

It was great for another year, and then I noticed that the dash was being burned by the sun.  Not only that, but it was peeling up.  Unfortunately, there was no warranty for that problem.  When I asked how much it would be to fix the problem--more dough than it was worth.  It amazing how such a little car has such costly problems.  

If I had known then what I know now.  I probably wouldn't have bought the Kia right away.  It was in it's first year of production and all new production cars have their quirks.  This little car just had more than its fair share.<br><br>
