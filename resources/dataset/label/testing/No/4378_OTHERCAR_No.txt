            My husband and I decided we wanted to check out the Kia. So we went and test drove the Sportage, decided we liked it. So we bought the 2001 Kia Sportage Limited. The Limited status gives you leather, different floor mats and emblem on each side of truck and a hard wheel casing on the rear of the truck. We enjoyed the comfort of the seating, plus it also has the knee airbag on the driver's side. I really like the shape of the seats, it was comfortable for me to place my head on the headrest, without jutting my head out. There is a cup holder in front, but it is placed in front of the heater/air vent. So in the winter, your drinks will get warm fast. Plus in the summer cold drinks that sweat, it drips down onto the shifter (that can't be good!) There is a nice storage bin under the passenger seat to hold papers or whatever! Cup holder & ashtray in rear. Tinted windows in the rear windows, helps for children. Interior feels cheap, like it  would rip very easily. Hard to keep mats clear, stain fast.
