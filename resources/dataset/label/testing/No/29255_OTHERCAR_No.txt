            In 1994 when my husband and I decided to buy an SUV, we checked out every one on the market. We finally decided on a '95 Blazer and at first we loved it. Within 6 months however, it began to have problems and it's been downhill ever since. We've had brake problems, electrical problems, transmission problems, you name it. At first we thought it was our mistake. 1995 was the first year Chevy redesigned the Blazer from the old style, and maybe we shouldn't have bought any vehicle in it's first year of change. But we've talked to owners of later model Blazers, and they too are unhappy with it. In addition to the mechanical problems, it's not as roomy as we originally thought it was. Since we had a baby, we discovered that with a carseat in the back, you can only fit one passenger wearing a seat belt. You could squeeze another one in the middle, but they can't wear their seatbelt. Also, the current recommendation is for carseats to be in the middle, but due to the 60/40 split seat, you can't do this. If you're thinking about buying a Blazer, think again! If you want an SUV, look at the other brands and steer clear of this one.<br><br>
