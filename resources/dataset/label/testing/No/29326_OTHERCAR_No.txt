            I purchased this truck in October of 1999, because I needed a vehicle with 4-doors as I was expecting another baby.  From the very start it has had little things go wrong with it; radio doesn't work right, automatic lights don't work right, interior lights didn't go on at night, the idle drops to almost stall it out when it is cold, and a few things I'm sure I'm forgetting.  It gets great gas mileage for a mini-SUV, and drives very smooth on the freeway, but overall I'm disappointed with the truck because it always seems to have something wrong with it.  I wouldn't recommend this vehicle to anyone.<br><br>
