            I've been driving my '95 G20 for over a year now.  I paid well below the going cost for it so I can't really complain, but all-in-all I can't say it's worth the going prices.  This car may look like a luxury sedan but it's nothing more than a Nissan Sentra with leather interior and a larger, heavier frame on the same engine.  My 'luxury' sedan doesn't even have cup holders!  The engine is slow and not very gas efficient.  The car seems as if it was hastily put together in other ways, also.  As the car gets older the seat belts tend to wear away the leather on the seats.  

The car also seems to have several mechanical type problems.  I don't claim to be a mechanic, but I have had trouble with the 02 sensor on the bottom of the car which I was told is a common problem on this model.  My engine mounts have also worn down (again, from what I've been told, this is common) causing the car to shake and shutter when stopped.  

This car's only real qualities are the Infiniti emblems and the leather interior; other than that it's an overpriced, average sedan.
