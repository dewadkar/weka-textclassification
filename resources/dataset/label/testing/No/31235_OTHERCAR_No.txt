            I own a 95 grand am and love it when it's working....sounds like a sarcastic statement but I'm being serious...when grand ams are working without any major problems they are a lot of fun to drive...unfortunately mine (and my sisters and moms) spent way too much time in the shop....Because the grand am is so computerized it is difficult finding someone who can fix it...I've never had to get so many second, third and fourth opinions...also the gas gauges are terribly designed...when you get down to 1/4 tank you better fill up because the gauge starts to dance real fast and you never know how much you really have....anyway I'm sounding more negative then I had planned but repairs for this car can add up fast so just beware.<br><br>
