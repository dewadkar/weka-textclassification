            At first glance this was going to be the next Range Rover, and at $40,000 who could resist so I leased one.  Lucky for me it was a 3 year because this is no Mercedes by any stretch of the imagination.  The fit and finish are sub-standard and after many off road excursions, it rattles like 2 skeletons dancing on a tin roof.  The only thing I like about it is that the lease payments are so high, I was able to trade it in before the lease expired.  I must say, that this vehicle should not be the gauge that other Mercedes are measured to.  The CLK430 I traded it in for is whatever the opposite of the ML is.  It's fit and finish are perfect and it rides like a 270HP safe.  I would not recommend this rattle box to my worst enemy.  And I would take reviews to the contrary with a grain of salt as it take a lot to admit one made a mistake...and boy I sure did.<br><br>
