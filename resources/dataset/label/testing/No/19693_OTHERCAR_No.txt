            Hubby and I both needed new cars so we shopped around, read our Consumer Reports, and wound up at our local Saturn Dealer (Saturn of Rt. 33, 3830 Easton Nazareth Hwy,Easton, PA 18045 (610) 746-1800 just as an FYI).  We purchased 2, yes 2, brand new 1999 SL2 sedans with everything...ABS, which forces you to upgrade the wheels, power locks and windows.  We were aware of the no haggle pricing, that's actually part of what drew us to Saturn in the first place, but since we bought 2 cars off their lot, we thought they might give us a little break.  But no, no break given.
Okay, so my radio speakers were fading in and out.  I called for service and was given a date 1 1/2 weeks out.  They inspected the car, and said it was fine, they didnt fix anything, there was nothing wrong.  I interpreted this as "you are wasting our time lady."  Of course, the problem continued, so I made another appointment, and again had to wait a week or so.  I was told again that there was no problem, they didnt hear anything wrong.  I had to FORCE them to take off the door panel, and wouldn't you know it, my speaker wire was loosely connected.  Amazing, right?  No apology was given, but at least I wasn't charged.  Some service, huh?
There have been other service issues with both of our vehicles, and though I won't list them, suffice it to say, the experiences have been similar.
The service we have received at our dealership has been substandard for any company, let alone when compared to what Saturn would have us believe we should expect. We can never get an appointment in the same week that we call, and the service staff is surly, to say the least.  We feel like we are bothering them when we call, when we have required a loaner car, it is usually a tremendous hassle, and they do not respond to phone calls in a prompt manner.
We filled out a corporate survey and included several pages of complaints.  Nobody ever called us to follow up on that.  We complained to the dealership itself about the service.  Did anyone ever call us?  You guessed it, NO!  So maybe they don't care.  

Let me add, too, that the car is really expensive for what you get, and it is teeny weeny, itsy bitsy inside.  I do not know what my husband and I were thinking when we bought these cars.

Just don't be fooled by spiffy ad campaigns that show them helicoptering the old lady to the dealership to buy a Saturn.  The dealer will be unlikely to service that car after she gets it home!  PEE EEWWWW are our thoughts on the entire Saturn Corporation!
