            Let me begin this review by stating that I am a die-hard Honda fan and have been for 18 years. So what am I doing driving around in a 2000 Monte Carlo LS?  Well a few weeks ago a lady decided to play bumper cars with my '98 Honda Accord EX V-6, so while my Accord is at the collision center, I've been driving a Monte Carlo. I'll try to be fair because I realize my Accord is a top-of-the-line Honda with many more luxury features than the Monte Carlo LS, so I'll only compare the standard features.

<b>Plusses:</b>
This car's wheelbase is longer than my Accord by about 4 inches, making the ride just a bit smoother. It also has 16&quot; wheels which also help deliver a more comfortable ride. The overall length of the Monte Carlo is almost 10&quot; more than my Accord, it's quite a boat.

The seats are comfortable, but I would have expected sportier bucket seats in a Monte Carlo. The gauges are easy-to-read and the instrument panel is well within reach, even for my short arms. The cargo area is larger than my Accord.

The car has some weird lines and a strange hump on the trunk, but overall I'm not embarrassed to be seen in it. This car has over 6,000 miles on it and I don't hear any of the rattles that I am accustomed to with American cars in past years.

<b>Negatives:</b>
The Monte Carlo is about 10&quot; longer than my Accord and 2&quot; wider, however the interior room is about the same. My mother actually complained about having less leg room in the front seat of the Monte Carlo. This car really goes through the gas as well. It's &quot;supposed&quot; to get better gas mileage than the Accord, but in reality in the city quite the opposite is true! 

I'm short, only 5' tall, and I have to pull the seat so far forward to reach the gas pedal that I am within inches of the steering wheel. This concerns me because I wonder what would happen if the airbag ever released and I'm sitting so close to the steering wheel. I know this is not an issue with most of you &lt;smile&gt;, but it has a lot to do with why I prefer Japanese cars.

The interior of this car is very spare and rather dull. Everything is plastic. The door handles, the door side panels, and all of the knobs and buttons. There is no cloth (except the seats), leather, or metallic adornment anywhere to be found, except a small Monte Carlo medallion on the glove box.

My Accord's 24-valve V-6 provides 200 horsepower, while the Monte Carlo LS only provides 180 horsepower. The Accord just seems to be peppier and quicker to respond. I won't go any further with the specifications, as I don't really know what most of them mean beyond the horsepower.

<b>Would I trade in my Honda Accord for a new Monte Carlo LS?</b>
Nope, I'll keep my two-year old Accord. This car is just too big and with all that extra bulk, it doesn't provide a much better ride or any more room for my passengers. The fuel tank in the Monte Carlo is the same size as my Honda; however when I drove my usual daily route, the fuel needle dropped like a rock. This is something that just doesn't happen in my Honda.  My Accord also just seems to have more energy and zip. In comparison, the Monte Carlo is a slow-moving behemoth.<br><br>
