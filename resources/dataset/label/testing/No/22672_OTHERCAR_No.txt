            Disclaimer: I am not mechanically inclined, I don't know what you call half the parts on a car... so forgive my layman's terms.

(The CONs are listed first, the PROs follow)

In April 1998 I bought a 1998 model Pontiac Grand Am. I had tested the 1999, fell in love with it during the test drive, but could not afford the payments. Instead I opted for a 1998, and can only say, I have never been so .... &quot;unenthused&quot; about a vehicle, per se.

They claim the gas mileage should be above 20 miles overall, yet I get probably 17 on the highway, and less than that in the city. I had the engine checked, and was told nothing is wrong with it, all readings are correct. 

Then the car started to fall apart in the first year. Within 6 months, the carpet on the driver's side was worn bald, down to the bare metal.
Driving down the road one day, the drivers' side rear view mirror just fell off. 
The stereo... &lt;shaking head&gt; Worst I have seen yet. I do not blare music, I listen to elevator music and talk radio, yet one of my rear speakers is blown, the volume control button on the radio only works if you pull on it while turning...

As a smoker, I use an ashtray, but the places where you can put the ashtray are very uncomfortable.

In defense of the car, I must say, I love the automatic headlights. The brakes are very responsive, the steering is tight and accurate and responsive. The transition between gears is smooth. The road noise inside the cabin is not bad. It is fairly comfortable overall. <br><br>
