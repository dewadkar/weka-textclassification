            <b>Problems from the start</b>
This is not my car but my Mom's car. SHe bought it used with 45,000 miles on it. At first we both loved the car. It was fun and quick, though we noticed that it started funny and the gas mileage was not all that great. Well, we thought that maybe it had set for a long time on the lot and maybe it would work itself out. <b>Wrong</b>

<b>Things only got worse</b>
The gas mileage was getting worse, it was dropping from average of 16mpg when we first got it to 12mpg now. The dealer has tried several things to fix it but it has only wasted her money.

Then the alternator went out, which is a common problem with GM vehicle, so again it was in the shop to have that fixed.

A couple of months later I got a call around 11:30pm from my Mom saying that here brake and turn singles lights were not working. SO I went over to the plant and checked the fuse. Guess what, it was fine. Well, we had to towed back to the dealer again to have this problem fixed.

The dealer has tuned up the car and still the gas mileage is no better, and the starting of the car still is not right. I thought maybe it was the fuel pump, but the dealer check it out and but they said it was fine.

<b>Monte Carlo's resale value is also terrible</b>
Mom decided to check on getting a dependable vehicle instead of the Bright Red piece of junk that we had now, but come to find out, the resale value nose dives after about 2-3 years. With 69,000 miles on it with the 3.4 V6 and all options including leather seats, the car was only worth a maxium of $5,000.

<b>Overall...</b>
I love the design of the car, it looks like it moving fast, when it is setting still. The car does have a lot of room, and does good in snow. My cousin who works for the Miami County Sherriff had a unmarked Monte Carlo was his police car and he never had any problems with it. But I have to say, it Chevy can not make a more dependable car than this, then I don't want one. I would stay clear of the 1996 monte's there is just too many problems with them.
