            Ok, don't call me ungreatful. I do completely appreciate the fact that my mom gave me her car, at no cost, and just out of the kindness of her heart and my necessity. However, oh how I wish the car wasn't a 1999 Kia Sephia.  

My mom admittedly bought the car because she thought it was "Cute". It is a really nice purple and it looks really good. She bought the car as a new car for a little under 15,000.  

So here I am 2 years later with the car.  Sure, it has a couple of newly acquired baby dents and scratches, but it is still ok. 

So those are the pros...keep in mind that the list was very short. Here are the cons...

Ok, if you read my cell phone epinion, you'd know that I drive on the freeway to get to work everyday. Well my little Kia is horrible for driving over say...60mph. Driving from Philadelphia to Tampa was a pain. Whenever the mph went over 70, the steering wheel would shake. The 1999 Kia Sephia that I have doesn't have cruise control either which means you have to have your foot on the pedal for the entire 22 hr drive from Philly to Tampa...pain!

The 1999 Kia Sephia really isn't a smooth ride and it eats up a lot of gas. Sure it only costs around 15 to fill the tank, but it is because the gas mileage is so horrible. 

The car also doesn't accelerate very well. I sometimes have to "floor it" just to get the car up to 50 mph when I merge onto the interstate. 

You might be thinking that there is something wrong with my car, but it isn't just my car, it is the Kia Sephia in general. I have gotten regular check ups for my car and I just got a full tuneup for over 500 dollars.  

The defrost isn't really great on the car either. Lately there has been a lot of mist and dew on cars in tampa and it has been difficult for me to drive because it takes forever for the windows to clear up and stay clear.  

As for the braking system...what a joke. The brakes had to be changed after about 3 months of driving. For any of you out there who have gotten your brakes repaired or replaced, you know how expensive it can be.

As for the interior, it is a small car, so it isn't very roomy inside. Personally, I am short and don't need a lot of room, but for taller people this car isn't very good when it comes to roominess. 

The car lacks a built in cup holder! Basically everything is manual (i.e. locks, windows, etc...).  

Lastly, the insurance on a Kia is very expensive (don't ask me why...probably because Kias suck and are prone to accidents). I found out that it would be less to insure about any car including a car like a Toyota Corolla or a Nissan Maxima (both of which I would rather have gotten).

All in all, the 1999 Kia Sephia isn't a good car, that is why they are so inexpensive. Don't make the mistake of buying a car for looks alone, buy it for what is on the inside.

Having written this epinion, I feel bad...Sorry mom, I really do appreciate the car...it is better than nothing...but my goal was to tell the readers about the car, which I did.
