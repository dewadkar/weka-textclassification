            I recently sold a 2002 VW Jetta in preparation for going back to school, and decided on a low-mileage 95 Saturn SL2 as my means of "basic transportation" for the next 4 years.  With that being said, I wasn't one of those overly-excited "homegrown" Saturn buyers that seem to be in existence; so I feel my opinion on the car is fairly unbiased.

There are 2 things about this car that I do not like.  The first is the engine: it's just plain loud.  It is, by far, the loudest vehicle I've ever owned, but this is just how Saturn S-series engines are.  It's a 5 speed, and I rarely rev the engine above 4000 RPM because it's so intrusive into the passenger cabin.  You just have to get used to this, unfortunately.  My second peeve is the oil consumption; it is imperative that you change the oil on Saturns regularly; they have very finicky piston rings that gum up with deposits if the oil is not changed every 3000 miles.  The result is increased oil consumption, which can range from a quart every 3000 miles, to a quart every time you fill up the gas tank (about 260-300 miles).  Heavier weight oil can help this problem some, but it's no substitute for oil changes.

Things I like: 15" wheels (on the SL2) in a market dominated by 13-14" wheels, an interior that looks much newer than a 95 model year, a factory stereo with better-than-average sound, excellent brake pedal feel (compared to other GM vehicles), infinitely adjustable tilt steering wheel.

General things about the car: The out-lying vents on the dash (next to the doors) are pretty much useless, they are all but impossible to direct at your face without being blocked by the dashboard itself.  The roofline is pretty low; I'm 6'1", and if I were any taller, I would not fit in this car comfortably.  The instrument panel is illuminated at night in a "theater style", meaning there are lights at the top of the dash that shine down on the gauge cluster, rather than just the characters being back-lit.  This is done because the gauge needles are opaque white plastic and do not light up; all you would see at night would be the numbers on the gauges, and no needles.  I think it's a bad design; why not just make translucent gauge needles like everyone else, Saturn?

And that's it.  It's everything I need in a car to drive to school and work everyday; and not a bit more.
