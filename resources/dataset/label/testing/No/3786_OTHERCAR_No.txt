            UPDATE:

This car has been nothing but a nightmare.  It has been in the shop about 7 weeks of the year which I have owned it.  The dealership is incapable of making repairs correctly and the corporation does not support the car once it is outside the dealership the purchase was made.  Went to the highest levels at BMW NA and have had little or no success in dealing with them.  Finally had to come to sue the dealership for full refund as the mileage stated in sales contract differed by 40% from the mileage on the service history.  Certified with BMW really means buy at your own risk.

I have driven many other cars throughout my lifetime but I must say that this 1999 M3 convertible is the best driving car I have owned.  I compare it to Lexus, Porsche, Mercedes and other BMW's and hands down in terms of comfort, handling and speed this is the best of the best.

The engine is a 3.2 Liter 6 cylinder putting out about 240 horsepower.  The tires are 17" and they stick to the road like glue.  The radio is the HK upgraded system with a subwoofer and I would say to upgrade the speakers inside as they get tinny at higher levels when driving too fast with the top down.  Seats are very comfortable and adjust in almost every direction.  They only lack in lumbar support which was surprising.

The rear seat is a real seat and fits two people of height comfortably.  You are able to hold a conversation in this car with the top down as the sound carries very well between passengers.

Performance wise info can be found at www.edmunds.com but I will say that the car accelerates perfectly across the gamet of RPM.  The best being just past 3500 and all the way up to the redline of 6500.  To go from 40 to 60 or 60 to 80 or even 80 to 100 in this car is child's play and takes a quick downshift which throws you back in your seat.

The car's brakes are amazing and can stop you from 100 to 0 in seconds flat with no smoke and mirrors.  Everyday driving in this car is fun and comfortable as you would expect from a BMW and the top flies up and down in 37 seconds flat.

Trunk space is real and useful for a full golf bag with normal clubs and a bag as well.
