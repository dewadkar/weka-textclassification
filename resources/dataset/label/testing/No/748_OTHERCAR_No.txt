            I bought a '94 Altima new because it was highly rated for reliability.  In my case, the magazine was wrong. After the first few hundred miles, the speedometer went out.  The warranty covered the part and labor; no further problems.  Then at about 30,000+ miles one of the fuel injectors malfunctioned.  Luckily the warranty also covered this problem.  Now, at 78,000 miles another fuel injection went dead, causing fuel to leak in the cylinder chamber and bending the piston rod.  The dealer said a complete engine overhaul would likely be needed -- at a tidy sum of $3,300.  So much for Altima reliability.  I'm sticking with Hondas.<br><br>
