            The Jeep Cherokee is by far the crapiest SUV that I have ever driven. Ass soon as I bought it I hit a pot hole going down a crappy road and the air conditioning failed to work. SUV my ass. When I  tried to drive through a small feild I hit a tractor divot and got stuck. This is by far the bumpiest SUV that I have driven. Even if I ran over a small speed bump, even with my seat belt on, I would end up hitting my head on the top of the Jeep. It also is one of the loudest cars I have ever heard, at 75mph I thought that the thing was going to blow up and the wheels were going to fly off. The thing that kills me the most is that it cost me $18,000. After about 2 weeks I decided I couldn't take it any more and traded it in for a used '99 ford F250, by far the best truck I have ever had.<br><br>
