            The Plymouth Breeze, in 1999, was quite possibly, the single car that could be spotted on the highway the most.  For the price of the car, this Chrysler Cirrus counterpart, has been considered to be quite a value by a lot of consumers.  From it's sleek stylish exterior, to it's luxurious cloth interior, the Plymouth Breeze truly appears to be well worth the money spent on the car.  With all the options, the Plymouth Breeze looks to be a luxury vehicle.  
While the Breeze may seem to have this appearance, the car truly lacks a quality interior component.  The 4 cylinder Breeze really lacks the power of it's V6 counterpart.  This small engine compromises the car's ability to attack hills at a comfortable speed.  Acceleration from a stop also seems to take longer than a brand new car should take.  Perhaps alternatives should be investigated before buying this car.  Although the price is slightly more than the Breeze, the Chrysler Cirrus all of the stylish perks that the Breeze has, along with the power.  If you are simply looking for a nice looking car without the power, than the breeze might be for you.  However, if you are truly looking for a luxury vehicle at a non-luxurious price, then consider the nearly identical Cirrus.<br><br>
