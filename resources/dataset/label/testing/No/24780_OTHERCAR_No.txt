            The Chrysler Sebring coupe still puzzles me. Here is a stylish, sporty coupe with great handling, exceptional steering control, and a decent pickup. And yet its shortcomings border on the unacceptable. 

<i>Note: This review is based on the LXi model.</i>

<b>The headaches </b>

Like the previous reviewer pointed out, the 17&quot; wheels are great for control - but <b>the rims</b> are now bent out of shape within 18 months of use. But my <b>biggest headache</b>  has been the very low <b>air dam</b> underneath the front of the chassis. If you have a dip or bump in the road, it is very hard to avoid the air dam hitting the pavement. In the course of time it broke. It cost about $600 to weld and fix it - and about a year later, it is back to square one.

The other big hassle are the <b>doors</b>. For one, they are very heavy. Granted, two-doors have heavier doors, but my passengers often complain about how heavy the door is. The other problem is that every time you open the door, the portion behind the door hinges subtly pushes against the side paneling of the door. As a result, both my side panelings came off. This was fixed under warranty, but now it is again coming apart. Talk about an engineering flaw!

Ah, then there is the <b>steering position </b>. This is the biggest mystery to me. WHAT were they thinking when they built the steering column so that even at its highest position, it will almost touch the lap of a tall person? If you are over 6', or slightly overweight, the steering is literally in your lap. Needless to say, it also makes the driver's entry and exit awkward.

The large <b>turning radius</b>, as the prior reviewer mentioned, is another nuisance. Making a u-turn on a two lane road is nearly impossible.

And finally, the <b>back</b> of the car is a little too high, providing poor visibility while reversing, etc.


<b>And now the good parts ... </b>

It is a shame that the above problems make the otherwise stylish coupe a pain to own. The Sebring comes with a lot when you buy it: the features I particularly like:

- great handling
- good steering control
- sleek body styling
- plush leather interior, easy to read displays
- compass on rearview mirror with digital read out
- very good sound system
- fog lights (very useful in San Francisco!)
- programmable garage door opener (you can program up to three separate openers)

<b>Is it worth it? </b>

Sadly, the answer is NO. It is a reluctant &quot;no&quot;, but the problems with the Sebring go beyond minor irritations. 

<i>&quot;If only&quot;</i> Chrysler had paid more attention to detail ...
