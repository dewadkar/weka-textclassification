                 Fast, powerful, and fun to drive.  However, the expense, aggravation of breakdowns, and price of gas counterbalance these good points.  
     The Chevy Camero is a classic, low cost &quot;muscle&quot; car.  It delivers power and performance in a very appealing package.  Even with the smaller V-6 engine, my 1992 Camero was a force to be reckoned with.  Of course, I was stepping up from a Ford Escort, but I was still impressed with the acceleration and power of this car.  Handling was nice, however I did find that around 120 mph (I can admit how fast I've driven it, now that I've sold it!) it did shake and sway a little.
     So the answers to the biggest questions of many people who consider buying a Camero: Yes, it is fast, it does accelerate quickly, and it is very fun.  However, here are a few details you may want to consider.
     The cooling system is a big concern.  I replaced nearly every part of the cooling system, and was still baffled when my engine would overheat.  This is very costly, and aggravating, to say the least.
     Next on my list of things to consider is the visibility while driving.  When sitting in a Camero, (I'm 5' 11&quot;) I struggle to see the road directly in front of the car.  It is also impossible to see the area around the rear quarter, which is quite dangerous when executing a lane change.
     If you have a family, consider the back seat.  Legroom is basically non-existent; anything more than a 5 minute trip becomes an eternity when sitting in one of the rear bucket seats.
     The last con that I would like to mention would be the gas mileage.  I averaged around 22 miles per gallon, and that's with a V-6 engine and a five-speed transmission.  I couldn't imagine what to expect from a Camero equipped with a 350 V-8.
     Overall the Camero is a fun car for any person who doesn't mind a little maintenance.  It's quick, it's fast, and it's fun.  Just think twice before trying to cram your family or friends in the back seat.
