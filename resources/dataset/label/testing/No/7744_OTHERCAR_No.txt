            I bought this car as one of my "first" cars.  I've had it going on 5 years and up until recently, it has been a problem-free, fun car to drive.

I can actually tell you the exact time when the problems started: it was like 5 minutes after the odometer rolled past 100 000km.  This was about 6 months ago. Since then, the following repairs have had to be done: all the weatherstripping around my windows had to be replaced as the windows were leaking (same with the trunk), the air-conditioning broke, the catalytic converter broke, and the head gasket started leaking oil.  The repairs were VERY costly.

Those were the downside. Despite these problems, I actually like my car.  It is fun to drive, easy to park, comfy and well laid out.  Many of the problems (such as the head gasket, relay-fan) are problems that chrysler dealerships have the power to pay for out of the company's pocket instead of yours.  

I do not recommend this car for people with more than one kid or people who are larger because the car really lags when full. But if you are a mechanic or can get this car post head-gasket replacement etc....it is a good starter car
