            Okay, I don't own this vehicle but I test drove it the other day.  The price was very good for a Pontiac and it looked great!  I got in and was VERY impressed by the sunroof.  All electric.  I must say I loved the sunroof. The steering was okay.  Not bad, not great.  The drivers seat is so comforatable I could have lived in it!  Loved that too.

I decided I didn't like the amount of room in the car.  It was small and not fit for passengers in the back.  I really don't know why the even put seats back there.  There was no leg room. I drove up a very large hill and there was no power.  I had the car floored and I could only do 40mph. This was really bad and right there I decided I didn't want to purchase this car.  It was a 4 cylinder.

I've owned other 4 cylinder vehicles and they had moore power than this.  I reccomend this vehicle only to those who care how the car looks.  It's obvious, looks fantasticly cool.  If you want a REAL sportscar with speed, don't look here.<br><br>
