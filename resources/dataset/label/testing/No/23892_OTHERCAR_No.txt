                I bought a 1995 Mazda Millenia new. It was an especially pleasing car at first. The ride was smooth and quiet, the handling was acceptable and the Bose sound system was first class. The Merot color was quite attractive and the tasteful leather interior was quite comfortable. In my normal daily driving the climate control was superb (more about this later).

    After the newness wore off I started to compare it to my previous car (a Lexus ES300). In most areas it compared well, but there were some annoyances, for instance the door mounted power window control for the driver was not lit and was sometimes hard to find at night. The wonderful sound system (and it really was) had rather complex controls (the Lexus was simple and excellent). The traction control and abs brakes worked flawlessly (the Lexus did not have traction control).

    Now back to the climate control. The first long summer trip turned to hell, after driving for about 45 minutes to an hour at highway speed, the vents started to expel what looked like smoke and then stopped to send any air through. The car quickly became an oven. If you turned it off, opened the windows and drove for about a half an hour (the ice all melted) you would have conditioned air again, but not for long. When we got to Florida I took it to Mazda dealer to have it fixed. Left it there for a day and was told it was fixed, it did work fine while we were there, but when we started home it behaved as if nothing had been done. I made numerous (about 5) trips to Mazda dealers and none of them ever fixed it right. Since we go to Florida alot, the car was traded and not for another Mazda. The car was wonderful and I wish I could be certain that I could buy another one and not have this type of problem.<br><br>
