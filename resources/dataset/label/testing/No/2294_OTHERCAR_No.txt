            I purchased a brand new Kia Sephia last year. We thought it was a cute car, and the price was so affordable, that it was just what we were looking for as far as our budget is concerned.

 Not one day later after driving it home, things started going wrong. The main problem was electrical. I would be driving down the road and my gauges would be jumping around, and my stereo would flash and shut on and off. 

We called the dealership in Montana, and they asked us to bring it back to be checked out. Keep in mind that this is a two and a half hour trip for us. So we take it back, and of course they can't find any problem. They looked at me like I was a idiot, and the service manager wouldn't even speak with me, only to my husband.

 Over the next six months, we made eighteen trips to the dealer. That is over 3300 miles, and at least 45 hours of driving, and they still couldn't find the problem. One morning, I went out and started the car before I had to leave for work, it was pretty cold out. I looked out the window, only to see smoke billowing out from under the hood and the interior of my car was pitch black. Seeing no flames, I ran out to shut the car off, and had my car towed to the dealer.

 We drove up the next day, only to hear them say that there was no problem with it. The inside of my car stunk like smoke, and my windows were  just black, but there was no problem. After all of this, we enforced the lemon law, and bought a Chevy Malibu. The only thing that I can say is that the reason you can purchase these cars for nothing is because they are cheap cars! I wouldn't wish a Kia on my worse enemy.<br><br>
