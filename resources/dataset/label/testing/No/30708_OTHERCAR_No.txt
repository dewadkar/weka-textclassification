            We had the Corolla in the detailing shop for a day. They are making it shiny by tomorrow! :-) We got a loaner until ours is ready. It is a 99 Pontiac Sunfire. At a first look, it seemed like a nice car. All shiny and clean. We hardly drove the car for a few miles and I felt how cheap this car is. It makes all kind of noises from the suspension and the downshift is somewhat jumpy as well. When I look at the car from behind, it is just ugly! It is probably one of the ugliest cars on the road after the Aztek. It looked nice from the front for a while, back at the detailing shop.

When we got home, I noticed rust inside the door hinges. I cannot believe this car is a 99. I also had to be very careful in the corners with it because the rear end of the car travels as I turn in sharper curves. I got out of the car to make sure everything is ok. The tires were cheap Good Year Conquest; all season radials with a fair amount of tread on them. The radio had big buttons like a child toy or something. I understand that these cars are very affordable and you can see quiet a few on the roads.

After all, the entire car looks and feels cheap. The fit and finish is low quality. The paint is orangey and the car does not feel safe. Unstable in curves, Noisy suspension, noisy transmission. Squealing and rattling from different places in the car. I personally do not recommend this car to anyone. You get what you pay for. If you do not have the money to buy a better car, just settle with a used but quality car instead. I never owned one of these Sunfires before and hopefully I never will. I love my Toyota and my next car is a BMW. Regards.
