            I considered myself the luckiest guy in the world when my father-in-law, an executive for an auto parts company, offered to sell me his company vehicle in 1997. Apparently, he gets a new company car every two years and each time he changes one in for the other, he has the option to buy the old car at an incredible price. So when he offered me the opportunity to buy a 94 Buick Park Avenue Ultra for less than half its Blue Book price, I jumped at the chance. Any other person looking to buy this vehicle would have paid $19000 or greater. I got mine for $7900. This Park Avenue had very few miles, was black in color, had power everything -- doors, windows, seats, had a killer sound system, was roomy enough for five large adults, plenty of trunk space, duel temperature control, and sun visors even for the backseats. As a friend of mine said, it was a living room on wheels. It was a tremendous step up from the 88 Chevy Celebrity I had been driving. 

Or so I thought.

I have had a great deal of trouble with my Park Avenue ever since I got it. Since purchasing the vehicle, I've gotten married and since my wife is still in school, I've been the sole bread-winner. Needless to say, I can't afford to buy another car yet, so I'm still driving the 94 Buick. 

About four months after the Park Avenue became mine, the rack and pinion went out. Got that repaired just in time for the alternator and battery to die in tandem. I have put three batteries and four alternators in this car since. But that's not. No, the Ultra model of the Park Avenue has a Supercharger that allows for rapid acceleration when needed. Nifty to have in emergency situations. However, when the Supercharger dies, so does any savings account. Less than three years in my care, the Supercharger began to fail. I got several estimates to repair, and the best offer I got was $2600. I had to have a car, and foolishly thinking it was better to pay for repairs as opposed to going into a new round of car payments, I shelled over the $2600. It ran better, I have to admit. For nearly three grand, the car better drive itself. About that same time, the electric seats went out. I haven't bothered getting them fixed since the driver's seat is stuck in the position I use to drive. Since then, there have been a couple compressors for the air conditioner and a new rear axle. For the past few months, all has been well. But time has a way of letting you know when it's time for more repairs, so I'm sure the clock is ticking until the next time I can make a major contribution to my mechanic's kids' college fund.

Another gripe I have about the car is that it's expensive just to do simple things to it. Case in point, about a year ago, an unknown vehicle backed into me and broke my left tail light. A tail light, that's all. Simple right? Nope. Apparently, the entire tail light system on the 94 model is one cohesive part that stretches the length of the rear end of the car. So you have to buy the whole shootin' match to fix one portion. The price tag? $350. Plus labor. Aggravating to say the least.

I have tried to buy American whenever I can. I know the American economy needs every bit of help it can get. I have tried to ignore the naysayers who say American cars suck. But my experience with the Buick Park Avenue seems to prove those naysayers correctly. This is a luxury vehicle, and a high-end model to boot. But what this model is really is a lemon. About a year ago, I bought my wife a 1988 Honda Accord with 200,000 miles on it for $1400. It has worked like a charm ever since, with the only repair work needed besides basic maintenance being one new tire. Honda: they make an excellent product. Buick: you need to remind yourself what "quality" means.

I'm wondering what my father-in-law must think of me to sell me such a car. Hmmm..........
