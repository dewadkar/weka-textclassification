            First I must state I do not own this car, thank goodness.  My friend has had one for about a year, and I have ridden in it numerous times.  I have also had the displeasure of working on it.

The transmission, which is typical of dodge small car/van trannies, is unrealible.  Already with only 80,000 miles on it the trannie had to be replaced.  Even with the new one installed the shifts are not sharp at all, with long lags between the start and finish of the shift.

The engine is grossly underpowered, as stepping on it results in nothing more than the enigine whineing louder, with no appreciable increase in speed.  This is definatly not a car for a person who enjoys speed.  Also, right at the same time the trannie went out, the head gasket failed, which was rather costly to replace.  The air filter is also usually soaked in oil, which is the result of some blow by action, which leads me to believe that the engine is shot totally.

Inside the car is cheaply put together, and it is obvious the sticker price on this car was rather low.  The seats are farily comfortable, and there is plent of room in the back, but these are the only pluses.

Any person that drives/rides in this car can tell instantly what the idea was; make a cheap car cheaply so people who can buy a car brand new, rather than getting a quailty machine off of a used lot.  Some would rather drive a brand new piece of junk than buy a used quailty machine
