            My Wife and I were car shopping to replace a smaller sportier car, when we spotted the Avenger. It seemed perfect. We loved the great looks, spacious back seat, and the loaded ES model had all the comforts we wanted (leather, excellent CD stereo, alarm, power locks &amp; windows, sunroof). We drove home happy.

 After owning this car for a year, we are not happy. First, the good part. It handles pretty well, It looks good, and other people constantly say &quot;what a great car!ï¿½

 Now, on to the bad stuff. Interior design. Bad, there is barely enough storage space for two Mcdonalds napkins, the cup holder will only hold a 12oz can, virtually nothing will fit in the center console, the glove compartment will hold one pair of latex surgical gloves and a small box of mints. The stereo is extremely inconveniently located right behind the shifter. The power mirror adjuster is awkwardly located and vvveeerrryyy ssslllooowww. There is an ashtray and lighted compartment precisely the size of a box of cigarettes, (which I suppose would be great if we smoked), right in the middle of the center console.

 Now the worst. No power. Even with the biggest v-6 available, gutless. The transmission has poorly chosen gear ratios i.e., when it shifts from second to third at full throttle the speedometer actually drops a few miles per hour as the wet paper sack in the engine compartment strains to pull the next gear.

 Reliability has been poor. We have only 10,000 miles on the car and have been to the dealer,(also poorly rated),several times. Once to have the paint fixed, (bubbles appeared all over the hood). Once the interior door panels and carpets were replaced when the doors started leaking a black tar substance inside the car. and the steering wheel shudders in your hands above 60mph, or any time you apply the brakes.<br><br>
