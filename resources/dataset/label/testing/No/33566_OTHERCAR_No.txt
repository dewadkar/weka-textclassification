            <b>Background</B>

After recently taking my '93 Escort to an incompetent Ford dealer for a new suspension, I was given the keys to a Suzuki Grand Vitari V6 to drive while they tried to determine why the work they did made the problem worse.  Therefore I do not own this vehicle, but I did have it for seven full days before taking it back, in essence demanding, a new rental vehicle.  You don't have to read any further to realize I don't like this vehicle very much.

<b>Initial Response</B>
Considering the rental company was supposed to give me a compact, like a Chevy Cavalier, I was thrilled to get my complimentary upgrade because they were completely out of sub-compacts.  Upon eyeing this machine I got excited: it sat high off the ground, was two-tone, grey on bottom and dark maroon on top, had 4 wheel drive and all the options (Power windows/doors, A/C, automatic transmission, cruise, and a cassette radio).

<b>First Drive</B>
My first mission was to get from the rental center to home.  Without being shown a single feature, they gave me the keys and let me go on my own.  Within seconds I had the headlights on and was on my way.

I travel on some pretty smooth roads, including about twenty minutes on an Interstate, so I was quickly taken aback when the Grand Vitari let me know every time it hit a small bump or dip in the road.  I fully realized and expected that an SUV would not ride as well as a car, but I have driven in Cherokee's and Explorer's and never found their rides to be annoying.  The Grand Vitari is a very annoying ride.  Not only is it annoying, but <i>loud</i>.  Having a quiet conversation in this vehicle is only possible if its still in the garage.  

<b>The next six days</B>
Over the course of the next six days my dislikes of the vehicle continued to build.  During a light snow fall, I noticed the Grand Vitari lose some grip going around a corner.  With a smile on my face I decided to quickly engage four wheel drive.  I heard a loud grinding noise and couldn't move the 4 wheel drive shifter.  I knew right away, this wasn't a shift-on-the-fly four wheel drive SUV.  Pretty darn annoying when traffic is behind you and there isn't a place to pull over for another five minutes.  This is a <i>must have</I> feature for anyone considering a four wheel drive vehicle - shift-on-the-fly four wheel drive.  You don't want it always on because that reduces your gas mileage and also increases the likelihood of problems with the four wheel drive system.  For a vehicle with a base MSRP of $19,000, this is a big problem.  After stopping on a side street to put it in four wheel drive, I must say it makes quite a bit of difference in terms of gripping the pavement under bad conditions.

Day three I went to put in some gas, since the rental company only gave it to me 3/8 full.  But where was the fuel-filler release?  After looking around for a full minute, I consulted the manual - right next to the drivers seat - but I'd already looked there.  I decided to look again.  Nope, not there.  I looked closer, what was that round black thing on the floor?  I examined it and discovered this vehicle, with 11,000 miles on it, had a broken fuel-filler door release.  The handle was snapped off.  Did a previous driver pull it too hard?  Possibly, but what kind of cheap plastic were they using that can't take a little abuse.  After putting on a winter glove, I managed to grip the remaining piece of the lever and opened the fuel door.  That's when I noticed how much gas this thing used, and began calculating my average fuel economy.  To keep you from the suspense, I averaged 17 mpg, and most of my driving is on the highway.  Not good, considering that a much larger Honda Odyssey minivan with a much more powerful V6 engine averages 25 mpg on the highway.

No this anti-Grand Vitari diatribe isn't over yet.  While driving into work on three different occasions, the defroster wasn't capable of removing the condensation on the front windshield.  After fifteen minutes, about half my ride to work, with the fan on full blast (which made alot of noise but didn't push that much air), I had to pull over and take a rag to the front windshield.  By the time I got to work, the condensation was so heavy again that I could barely see to park.  I admit that during this week there was abnormally cold/humid air that when it encounters a warm windshield exacerbates this situation, but for a 2001 model year vehicle not to have the capability of removing all the condensation, under any circumstances, in my opinion is unacceptable.

<b>The Pain Continues</B>
The windshield wipers have that annoying condition of not getting the bottom most middle of the windshield clean.  The reason is because the wash fluid sprays only in the middle of the windshield.  This is the reason they invented "wet-arm" wipers, but Suzuki doesn't see fit to include this feature on their most upscale vehicle.

<b>V6 Engine</B>
The only thing this V6 engine does that even remotely resembles a V6 is suck gas.  Pickup is horrible, and coupled to a very mediocre automatic transmission, shifting is to abrupt, power is minimal and it is loud when pushed.  I honestly opened the hood and checked to see if there really was a V6 under the hood, just to make sure it wasn't just a decal someone accidentally put on the side of the vehicle. 

<b>Overall Cheapness</B>
All of the controls feel cheap.  The lack of quality reeks throughout this vehicle.  The rear seats don't fold completely flat, as advertised.  The radio controls are too small, the fan too loud and yet under-powered.  The broken fuel filler door and the rattle the doors make when slammed shut.  While it didn't break down, the vehicle only had 11,000 miles on it.  I would be surprised if it makes it past 50,000 without requiring significant work.

<b>Some Good News</B>
The daytime-running-lamps worked well and I enjoyed the hatchback versatility when taking a trip on the weekend to Toys 'R Us and buying a new bicycle for my just-turned four year-olds birthday.

<b>Conclusion</B>
Bad gas mileage, little power (even with the V6), no shift-on-the-fly four wheel drive and questionable workmanship require me to tell you <i>NOT</i> to buy this vehicle.  Unlike most vehicles, there was so little good about the Grand Vitari, that I can't imagine they sell more than a few thousand of them a year.  Don't be one of them.
