            I lease a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am.  I have had it since February 1999.  I like the look of the car, the ride, and the gas mileage.  Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks.  The main problem I have with the car is the limited field of vision for the driver.  If you look back over your right shoulder you see the headrest on the front passenger side and it blocks the view to the drivers rear right and back.  If you turn to your left you encounter the support strip between the left back and front doors, obscuring your vision and creating a safety hazard.  
  I have also noticed the car suffers from &quot;low traction&quot; on wet streets and dirt roads.
   I feel the car would be more suited to a single person, or as a first car.  I have 5 grandchildren and it is difficult to get them all in at once.  
   I have enjoyed taking driving trips for a couple of hours on the highway.  The car performs excellently.  Gas mileage is superb.  I have really enjoyed the sound system with the radio and cassette player.  It is comfortable, but I miss the large drink holder between the driver and passenger.  I wish I had read the Epinions report before purchasing my Grand Am, I would have thought better of it.  I hope to trade it as soon as possible.  I will be more careful next time.<br><br>
