            <b>History</b>
Luxury manufacturers have always loved their big coup�s. Whether it has been the Bentley Continental (not really in the same league as these cars but I love it all the same), BMW 8-Series of the 1990&#146s, Aston Martin models or various Jaguar selections, Mercedes-Benz has always produced an exclusive selection of S-Class equivalent 2-doors and a competitor to the cars I have just mentioned. These models always seem to be considerably more expensive than equivalent 4-door counterparts. It doesn&#146t&#146 make any real sense. After all you are buying a car that is smaller and often equipped with less &#150 it is the buying of the &#147coupe&#148 elegant sports/luxury image, which pushes the price up.

Mercedes first began producing an &#147S-Class Coup�&#148 in the early 1980&#146s. It was the known as the SEC and was simply a shrunk down form of the W126 S-Class. The model never really sold well, probably due to the awkwardness of the design. The W126&#146s heavy styling did not translate well into a sports guise. The looked its best in the 4-door limousine and that is where most of the sales were. When the W140 was released, a coupe was released soon after. Confusion surrounded its model names over the years, as it was changed 3 times. Originally there were the 500 and 600 SEC, those were then changed to the S500C and S600C with the midlife update and then finally Mercedes adopted the CL500 and CL600 cars. In my own opinion these were magnificent automobiles. They were elegant, luxurious and so beautiful. I would by own one now if it was not for their apparent rarity. 

In 1999 Mercedes released their W220 S-Class and along with it, the new W215 CL-Class. For the first time the CL-Class adopted a totally different style to the S-Class, although significant component sharing was evident. I test-drove a CL600 in early 2000 as I was in the market for a new car, and proclaimed it as the car of the devil. I hated everything about the car. It&#146s disgusting, tasteless interior drew significant criticism, that heavy feeling V12 and there was something awkward about the styling that didn&#146t quite fit. Combined with a hideously expensive price tag my business went elsewhere.

In 2003 Mercedes has updated the W215 CL-Class along with the W220 S-Class. Recently I tested the W220 as I am in the market for a new car, as is my wife. We are replacing her ailing but loyal Mercedes E320C and she is every bit as interested in the CL-Class. We tested a new CL55 AMG.


<b>Appearance</b> 8/10
Unlike the CL-Class&#146 predecessor, the W215 was not favourably styled in my own opinion BEFORE I tested this car. I have changed my mind, having decided that the car I drove in 2000 was in one of the worst colours that made the car look fat and cheap &#150 Aragonite blue which is like an emerald green. The car my wife and I tested was in a beautiful &#147Chalcedony Blue&#148, as part of a special paint option. The car appears to be silver but on certain angles adopts a slightly blue tinge. That said, almost every single CL-Class that I have seen has been in a silver so it is quite common which some people might not like.

The 2003 model has not been updated on the exterior, Bi-Xenon headlights and new taillights have been fitted. As with all S-Class coupes to date, Mercedes has added no B-Pillars meaning that the car has a very airy look and feel. Another feature, which I like is the retractable rear windows, something uncommon in coupes. The car looks particularly stunning from the side and rear. From the side you can see a beautiful flowing roofline, one of the best looking cars I have seen in a long while. A particularly thick C-Pillar and a significantly curved rear glass screen are interesting touches but really finish the car off well. The car always looks as though it is moving, the design is so flowing. From the rear the CL looks excellent, with the AMG styling pack fitted on the CL55 as standard. Four rear exhaust pipes, two either side of the give the car a very sporty look. They sound brilliant too! Beautiful 18-Inch AMG wheels, which are apparently painted in sterling silver (If I am supposed to believe that they must think that I am sort of fool) were fitted to the CL55 I drove. Available as optional extras at an exclusive price (AUD $8500)

If there were ONE problem, which I don&#146t like about the current CL-Class it would be more to do with the image of the car. Lately it seems many trashy characters of the tabloids, rock stars and the likes are driving the CL-Class. In my native Germany it is a big choice among the &#147new rich set&#148 who want to flaunt their money and shove it under your nose wherever they are. I don&#146t know about you but if I am to spend this much on a car I want to get a desirable image too. Mercedes has certainly "youthened" their image, hopefully not in the wrong ways though. 


<b>Interior and Accommodation</b> 36/40
<b><i>Quality</b></i> 4.5/5
The quality of a Mercedes-Benz CL-Class is very interesting. When I tested the CL600 in 2000 I was APPAULED by the quality Mercedes had applied to their &#147flagship&#148. Panel gaps, cheap plastic, inferior interior materials (leather, carpet, headliner etc) and disgusting light coloured wood were all present. All these problems seem to be rectified in the updated CL-Class, as what has happened with the S-Class. A warning to all potential buyers! NEVER buy a Mercedes S-Class or CL-Class with Alpaca Grey or Pebble Beige interiors. They look like cheap junk, the colour co-ordinated plastics are hard and distasteful and Mercedes specifies with car with light coloured chestnut, which further demotes the feeling of the car. 

The CL55 I tested was fitted with the much better quality Nappa leather. Not only is it applied to the AMG sports seats, but to the doors, the dashboard and every other interior panel that would otherwise be fitted with plastic. The beautiful stitching and the special feel you get just touching it wherever you go overwhelm the senses. The rich looking polished walnut looks especially beautiful with the dark leather. On the same day I sat in a CL500 that was pre-owned, and was fitted with a Pebble Beige interior. The leather looked cheap and dirty, in the back seat the leather had ripped and on the headrest in had been cracked by the sun. Admittedly it was the normal leather, which is of an inferior quality, but even on an abused car these things shouldn&#146t happen after 18 months. The Alcantara headlining looked dirty and I could just tell that it was the combination of bad quality, a horrible colour and abuse which made the interior a much worse place to be. Thankfully Mercedes has picked up their end of the problem.

Apart from the rather superb quality of the interior, I was also impressed by other little touches that were fitted to the car. I love the chrome accenting on the controls, and some of the buttons or the areas you are supposed to touch. Other touches such as the bonnet, which has been properly painted on the underside, or the doors, which move inwards on the hinge to allow easier access to the rear in close confines due to the large doors all add up to a more pleasurable ownership experience.


<b><i>Ease of Use</b></i> 4/5
It is becoming hard for me to evaluate the <i>ease of use</i> section as I am fairly accustomed to the workings of a Mercedes-Benz. That said, I will use my wife&#146s opinions on how she found the car to use. My wife managed to settle into the car fairly easily, seating and steering wheel adjustments were all easy to find and manipulate. However when it came to using the COMAND system it was a different matter. The number of buttons and controls on the system confused my wife, particularly when using the navigation. The dual controllers on the system made other features easy to manipulate, I think it is just getting used to the COMAND system, which would take a while. The cleaner looking interface as part of the update of the model does make the car a much easier and nicer looking system to use.

<b><i>Seating</b></i> 5/5
The CL55 uses much of the associated technology fitted to  the seating of that in the W220 S-Class. The CL600 and CL55 both come with Multicontour backrests. Pneumatically operated air cushions in the lower part of the backrest adapt to the shape of your body. If you activate a special setting these air cushions pulsate, supposedly alleviating tension in your back. To make matters even more complicated the seats can be put onto a certain setting that adjust according to your driving style. That means when you take a corner, the appropriate section of the seats air pockets will inflate to give you better support. It is a strange sensation as you drive and this occurs but it really does provide you with a supportive &#147lounge chair&#148. 

Naturally the seats in the CL55 are electrically adjustable to 14 different positions. Three memory positions are available, and store the position of your seat, mirrors and steering wheel position. The seats are heated and cooled, making driving in hot weather and black leather desirable. The CL55 AMG has different shaped and looking seats to that of a normal CL600. The seats are much more heavily bolstered and firmer, something, which I think the current S-Class and CL-Class, also need. Disappointingly the CL55 doesn&#146t have electrically adjustable rear seats, even though it is more expensive than the S600L, which is fitted with such a feature and is considerably cheaper.

<b><i>Technology</b></i> 5/5
As the brother of the S-Class, most if not all the technology is shared.
<i>Linguatronic</i> - Linguatronic is the system of voice recognition and activation which Mercedes uses on its telephone and audio system. You can use simple, easy to remember commands to store numbers and searching stations on the radio.
<i>Distronic</i> - A proximity system that enables you to keep a set distance from the car in front of you. A radar sensor measures your speed, comparing the distance to the vehicle in front. If the vehicle in front slows, engine power is decreased, brakes are applied and if the car cannot slow quick enough an audible signal sounds to apply the brakes heavily.
<i>Parktronic</i> - An electronic system which helps you to park and manoeuvre your way in and out of tight parking spots. Special sensors  bounce ultrasonic signals off the object behind you and then displays in the interior show how close the vehicle is to the detected obstacle. Once the object becomes very close, a constant audible signal is heard.
<i>Tyre Pressure Monitoring</i> -  Four special sensors are fitted to each tyre valve, which measures the pressure and temperature of the tyre. This not only acts as a safety system but also keeps your tyres under optimum conditions for extended life. From what I have heard from others however, the system is full of problems.

<b><i>Heating and Ventilation</b></i> 5/5
The climate control system in the CL-Class is one of the best in the business. It is fully automatic, highly adjustable, efficient and powerful. Dual climate control zones are part of the system, enabling both front seat passengers to have different temperature zones. A number of sensors take into account a variety of factors including sun position and intensity, humidity, number of occupants and pollution. The system isn&#146t the easiest to use, but if you take a careful look it seems the system is highly logical.

<b><i>Sound System</b></i> 4/5
A high quality BOSE sound system is fitted to the CL55 AMG. The 10-speaker system complete with amplifier and woofers is very powerful, clear and reproduces all sorts of music with clarity. Mercedes added a selection of CDs to the boot mounted CD changer (in an inconvenient location) so we could test the system, and it did not disappoint. The BMW Logic 7 system is better though. The system is a little difficult to use, having to activate it through the command system is a hassle at times.

<b><i>Safety and Security</b></i> 5/5
The CL-Class is one of the safest cars in its sector. In typical Mercedes fashion there are safety innovations everywhere. The CL-Class has a sophisticated safety structure. Crumple zones are equipped with crash boxes and a deformable aluminium support frame. A number of airbags are fitted to the interior, dual driver and passenger airbags, side bags on the front doors as well as in the rear compartment and window bags, which act like a curtain over the windows in the act of a car accident.

There are a number of features, which may seem insignificant but actually play a large part in preventing an accident. Things like a headlight sensor which turn the headlights on and off according to ambient lighting. Bi-Xenon headlights are brighter and more precisely directed than traditional headlamps. A gas discharge lamp provides dipped and high beam settings. Rain sensors, which control the wipers according to rainfall intensity, mirrors, which automatically dim, and rear head restraints, which can be lowered from the front seat to aid in vision, are other examples. There are also a couple of electronic safety devices, which I will underline in handling. Naturally an alarm system and immobiliser are standard. When you unlock the car at night you will be in for a nice surprise. Personal street lamps illuminate the road outside the doors via lights located underneath the mirrors. Impressive and functional.

<b><i>Storage and Space</b></i> 4/5
The CL-Class is smaller than the S-Class and storage space is not quite as ample. Door pockets, a large glove box and centre armrest storage compartment is the only spaces provided for the front seat occupants. In the rear a wooden lidded box between the front seats provides a rather spacious place to store oddments. I was very impressed to find a refrigerated storage compartment on the options list. It fits in the space behind the rear centre armrest allowing you to keep drinks and other items cool for long trips. The rea seat has adequate room, but don&#146t expect S-Class like room. My wife commented that she was quite comfortable sitting back there during some of the test drive. When I sat back there with my 194cm frame I found it to be quite small though. Lucky the rear seats are comfortable.



<b>Engine and Handling</b> 18/20
<b><i>Engine and Performance</b></i> 10/10
The CL55 is fitted with a 5.5 litre Supercharged V8. Don&#146t get confused between the 5.5 litre Bi-Turbo V12 of the S600L/CL600, they are quite different engines however performance figures are almost the same. The CL55 produces 368kW, and a maximum of 700Nm between the very useable 2750-4000 RPM range. What does all this translate to? Blistering performance! This car really is something the devil would drive if he wanted a Mercedes. With a 0-100km/h (0-62mp/h) time of 4.8 seconds, this car is no slower than the CL600 as the V12 weighs that much more. While the dealer couldn&#146t tell me what top speed figures were due to the speed limiter, he did say that the slightly more powerful V12 is good for 308kp/h. Of course the excellent sound deadening and refinement of the car don&#146t lead you to think that this car is so fast &#150 at least from the inner sanctum.

<b><i>Handling</b></i> 8/10
Sporty ride and handling is also the forte of the CL55. The car really does feel much smaller than what it is, the same feeling you get driving an S-Class. This can be attributed to the airy interior as well as the well-engineered chassis. Part of the successful nature of the car is owing to the significant electronic aids, which are fitted to the car. The car is fitted with Active Body Control (ABC) and it is this system that gives the CL its composed yet sporty handling. The system incorporates the steel springs, hydraulics and dampers as well as the sophisticated electronic componentry. These steel springs can have various amounts of power diverted to them via automatically adjustable hydraulic cylinders. You can decide between a comfort and sport setting at the touch of a button. Self-levelling suspension is also fitted keeping the body of the car perfectly level, no matter what the weight distribution is.

Electronic Stability Program (ESP) uses a variety of sensors to recognise dangers and specific risks (skidding wheel etc.) at an early stage, and thus preventing the vehicle from becoming unstable. ESP can use engine torque and brakes on one or more wheels to stabilise the vehicle if a risk is detected. I have detected the system in use before, indicated by a yellow flashing triangle in the instrument binnacle.

The CL55 AMG has a definite sports handling bias, but it is perfectly suited to every day driving as well however I would have preferred it to be a touch softer.


<b>Ownership</b>
<b><i>Insurance</b></i>2/5
Insurance in Australia is ultra expensive. For the high performance models in particular (CL600, CL55AMG) the price is significantly higher than that of a normal luxury car. Dealer quoted AUD $2500 per annum. The most expensive price of ownership will be depreciation, but in comparison with other ultra luxury models (Bentley, Jaguar) the CL is still one of, if not the strongest in retaining value.

<b><i>Maintenance</b></i> 3/5
Servicing costs won&#146t be debilitating, replacement of components once the car is out of warranty will be though. Servicing is indicated via the on-board computer so you won&#146t be paying for services you don&#146t need. The car uses considerable amounts of expensive premium unleaded &#150 19 litres/ 100km/h. If you have owned a luxury car before, it won&#146t be anything you have not previously experienced.


<b>Total Score</b>
Appearance 		- 8/10
Interior and Accommodation	- 36.5/40
Engine and Handling		-18/20
Ownership			- 5/10
<i>Total			- 67.5/80</i>


<b>Final Evaluation</b>
I think I have been very fair in scoring the CL55 AMG when compared to the S600L I drove last month, which I may have scored too harshly. The CL55AMG is a talented car, however I have a few problems with it. First of all it costs significantly more than the S600L which is a BETTER car &#150 it has better performance, more space, nice handling and has more features. I don&#146t like paying an extra AUD 30 000 for a car just because of the shape of its roof and lack of 2 doors. My second problem is the car considers itself to be a sports coupe, and yet it isn&#146t a terribly exciting car to drive. Yes: it has the performance. Yes: it has well weighted and accurate steering. Yes: it has the handling. But the car lacks the persona of a real sports car. If you want performance buy the SL55, if you want luxury buy the S600L, if you want both buy the CL55.

The interior is a beautiful place to be, but it is no better to that of the current S-Class, with the exception of a nicer looking centre console. It is undeniably beautiful, comfortable, fast and exclusive &#150 if you want these things in a sports car then the CL55AMG could be a choice for you. For me it is unnecessary expenditure on an automobile which does nothing better than its bigger brother. 

<i>Having driven this car my wife and I placed an order for a 2003 Mercedes S600L due to be delivered in May. This will be her car &#150 I am no closer to making a decision for myself however. 

<b>Shortlist:</b> Mercedes-Benz SL55, Volkswagen Phaeton W12 (Due next year in Australia), Audi A8 (due May in Australia). <b>Wish list &#150 I can wish but I will ever be allowed to!</b>: Pre-owned Ferrari (Unjustifiable), Pre-owned Bentley Continental (Very expensive, Very Exclusive)</i>
