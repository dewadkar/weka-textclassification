            I bought the Dakota because it looks good. I really like the way it looks. There is no doubt that Daimler Chrysler has the finest design studio in the industry. What they really lack is engineering. When you buy one of their products you basically become their test mule. They do their research and development on your time. I know some of the service writers at my local dealership better than some members of my family. They've changed the catalytic converter three times. Oil leaks, motor and steering twice, water pump once. And a number of other problems that I don't remember right now.
To drive this truck you MUST own a cell phone for when it brakes down. Mine is a '98 which I bought new and it has been serviced according to manufacturers specs.
If you're a lonely person you ought to buy one of these babies. You'll get to be good friends with the service people at the dealership.
If you don't have a lot of time to waste waiting for your truck to be fixed then go buy a Tundra and live happily ever after.
