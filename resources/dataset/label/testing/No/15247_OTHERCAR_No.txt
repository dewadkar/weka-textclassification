            I owned a 1991 Pontiac Grand Am. We bought it brand new from the lot. Power steering, tilt seat, awesome fabric, great system, etc. Rode great to. Handled beautifully!

After a couple of years, the car was great. No problems with it whatsoever. Then in about 1995, with only 40,000 miles, we started having problems. Alternator kept going out on it, car starting dying, and the brand new tires we bought in 1995 wore. We took it in to the shop, and they told us that nothing was wrong with it. Well my father and I starting taking the Grand Am apart to see what was wrong. We gave her an oil change regularly, tune-up regularly, rotated tires, etc. The fuel pump was bad. That is not suppose to happen to a car practically new. So, we changed the pump ourselves. Saved us about $1,000. 

Well after that it ran ok for about a year. Then about a year later, we started having problems with the battery and alternator. There was a chip in the alternator that needed to be fixed, but nobody told us that. So it made the alternator bad, and battery die all the time. I went in to have it checked, but they said again that there was nothing wrong. Again, after taking the car apart, we found that it was a little chip inside of the alternator that was bad. 

So, after we got all of those problems fixed, the car has been pretty good. When driving, it rattles like it will fall apart if you hit a bump to hard, shocks are new, but ride like they are worn down, and we have to replace the muffler almost every year.  Sorry to say that I will never buy a Pontiac again because of the problems me and my friends have had with ours. 

The sad thing about this is that we took care of the Grand Am like it was a brand new car. No lead feet, took it to get regular oil change, and tune-ups, changed tires every 2 years, and brakes every 14,000 miles.
