            I bought my KIA Sportage in the spring of 1999. I wanted am SUV more than anything. What I actually got was a piece of junk. Originally, I thought that the Sportage would be a good choice since it was less expensive than some of the other SUVs on the market. Whoever said, &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; must have thought that one up while sitting at a dealership with his KIA in the shop for the hundredth time.

I was so excited to drive my KIA. That pleasure lasted for about 1 month when I got my FIRST recall for the Hub bearings. Of course the reason for my buying a brand spanking new car was to avoid dealing with car trouble...or so I thought. Since I bought my Sportage at a dealership that was about an hour away from my house, I figured that I would go to a closer KIA dealership to have the recall service done. When I called to schedule the appointment, I was told that this dealership was only performing the recall service on vehicles that were sold by them. If I wanted to have then do it, then I would have to wait about 2-3 months and step to the back of the line. Evidently they felt they could penalize me for purchasing my Sportage elsewhere. Funny, I thought that if you buy a KIA, you should be able to take that KIA to ANY KIA service station....what planet did I live on?!?!?!?!?

I finally got the hub bearings replaced by another KIA service station that was nice enough not to turn me away. Unfortunately, I had to travel an hour to get there, but hey isn't KIA all about convenience?

Shortly after this mishap, my Sportage stated dying whenever it would rain. I was stranded on the side of the road waiting for a tow to the nearest dealership. As &quot;luck&quot; would have it, it was towed to the same dealer that had originally rejected my car for the recall. After looking into the problem, it was diagnosed that the battery had died. Let's not forget that I have only had my car for about a month at this point. Soon after there was another recall on the Sportage. This time it was the fuel injection line. I decided to take my car to a completely different KIA dealer. I had high hopes that not all of the dealerships were lacking in customer service.....WRONG!!  I was notified around noon that my car was ready, so during my lunch break I had a friend drive me to pick it up. When I got there, I was told that the mechanic had just taken it for a test drive and he would be right back. 45 minutes later still no Sportage! Apparently, the guy must have stopped to grab a bite to eat while I was spending my lunch break waiting for him to get back. They had to drive my car to my office because I refused to wait any longer.

I have had my KIA for 15 months now and at this point, I am waiting to bring it into the shop again. This time, the paint is chipping on the front and back rim and I am unable to open the back. The coil that releases the tire is jammed and needs to be replaced. I brought my car to the original dealer that had rejected me (what can I say, I'm a glutton for punishment)and asked the service manager to evaluate the vehicle. Apparently he was inconvenienced by my presence because there was a lot of huffing and puffing going on as he walked with me to assess the damage. He tried to tell me that the paint chipping was caused by pebble damage. I begged to differ and he said that he would have to call to verify that my warranty would cover the repairs. He was supposed to call me with the results 2 weeks ago. So, I decided to call him for a status and he told me that he was waiting for someone to approve it and that the guy MIGHT be in next Thursday. I told him that I wanted to schedule an appointment with the body shop before they were booked out too far. He refused to book my appointment until this guys approved the repairs. He told me that I should bring my car back to the dealership from which I bought the car and have them do the repairs. Are you seeing a pattern with this guy? On top of those repairs, my brakes sqeak like a mouse in heat. 

I only have 25,000 miles on  my Sportage and all these problems to along with it. It scares me to think about what might go wrong when the warranty expires.

This is by far the WORST car I have ever owned!! If I could afford to trade it in now I would. I have learned my lesson the hard way and will buy my future vehicles from reputable dealers from now on. All i have to say is BUYER BEWARE!!!<br><br>
