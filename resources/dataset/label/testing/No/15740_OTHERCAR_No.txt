            Don't be fooled by this beautiful machine,  I was.  I read all of the reviews, they said beware the transmissions and watch for engine problems.  But I did not heed the warnings,  the car's comfort and beauty suckered me.  The 929 has to be the best looking most comfortable car to ever have come out of Japan,  but having previously owned an RX7 a 323 and a Protege I should have known better.  Parents move your kids away from the monitor,..... Mazda &quot;sucks&quot;.  I have now learned my lesson.     Without warning on my way to pick up my mother from the airport the tranny let go.  Yes I know I was warned but I treat my cars good this car had the tranny fluid flushed and changed a month before she let go.  I only use Mobil 1 in the engine, so far so good on the engine.  Various interior parts have been snaping and the power antenna is shall we say is a manual antenna now.  I was previously a valet parking attendant in Las Vegas for quite a few years and take my advise....dont buy a Mazda 929! If you want a real luxury car buy a Lexus or Caddy.<br><br>
