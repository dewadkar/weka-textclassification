              I bought this vehicle because I really liked the way it looked and that it looked different than all the other trucks out there.  I liked the tinted windows too.  I got the 1998 4-cylinder sport model with a stick shift.  The transmission's held up pretty well, considering I learned to drive stick on it.  I had to replace the tires at about 24,000 miles.  I've had the emergency brake release lever/latch thing replaced twice-they couldn't get the tension on it right so I broke it off twice trying to release the emergency brake.  The speakers make the doors rattle-and I don't have the music up loud at all.  Something's wrong on the driver's side window-it feels like the window's off line, but when I took it into the dealership, they claimed to have fixed it (for free thank God) but it's still not right.  The paint sucks.  There are scratches (only two that I'm responsible for) and swirls all over.  It seems like almost anything scratches this paint. The gas mileage is ok, especially if I'm on the freeway a lot and not doing too much hill driving. 
  I think there's more room in the back seat than most trucks, but it's probably best for kids or short people.  It rides pretty well, but sometimes it doesn't seem to want to shift, especially into second gear.  I think it's really comfortable and pretty, though.  The dealership has been really good about looking at stuff and fixing the same thing over and over, but they take forever even if you have an appointment and they have really limited hours.  All the interior stuff works well-seat belts, gauges, radio, AC.  Overall, it's an OK truck.  I don't know if I'd get another one.  The category for quality says rattles a lot...it only rattles some on the doors...it doesn't squeak too much...just sometimes when I step on the brakes and on the clutch.
