            I need to preface my remarks by saying that I am currently the owner of a &quot;classic&quot; body style, '93 Lincoln Town Car.

I titled my review of the '99-2000 Town Car as I did, because I cannot BELIEVE Ford took an absolutely BEAUTIFUL body style and ruined it!  This year's Town Car looks like a TURTLE -- and an ugly turtle at that!  It's a throwback to the old 1949-50 Hudson, and is absolutely the worst-looking luxury car on the road today.

I absolutely love my Town Car -- dependable, durable, very low maintenance.  But the NEW Town Car?  No self-respecting Lincoln lover would be caught dead driving, or even riding, in one.  When are the Ford designers going to WAKE UP and realize that they have created a real LOSER with this body style?

I've spoken to quite a few owners of '92-'98 Town Cars, and almost to a person, they love their current car, but express the same feelings about the new body style.  I have jokingly (but about half seriously) said that &quot;three chimpanzees on drugs&quot; could have designed a better looking car.  Please, please -- PLEASE, Ford Company, re-design the Town Car, beginning with the 2001 model, or I, for one, will never buy another one!<br><br>
