            I purchased the Eclipse RS and I thought that it was a good car. I loved the cherry red color, sporty look and smaller frame. From the old saying "If I knew know, what I didn't know then", it applies like a bee to honey.

This car is awful. I have had problems with the room inside the car. Anyone over 5'10" cannot fit in this car if anyone sits in the rear seats. The computer in the car has been replaced once (within the first two years) and needs to be replaced again as the oxygen sensors are being misread. This is causing a variety of lights to appear on the dashboard.

The service engine light continously pops on and off due to polution sensors that mechanics cannot repair without asking for a large bill. 

The cruise control doesn't operate at all and when the battery died, I had to put the designated number in the stereo so it would function again. It wouldn't take the manufacturers number so the car had to go into the dealer (where many cars were being brought in for that same problem).
