            Both Honda and Acura are synonymous with quality. I owned an Accord previously and was very happy with it. Integra didn't seem like much of a gamble.

First I must confess, I logged on high mileage on my car. Somewhere between 20 and 25k miles per year. For the first 60,000 miles, the car was flawless. Oil change every 7,500 miles (don't let anyone tell you otherwise, read your owner's manual). Tune up every 30,000 miles. It was beautiful.

Unfortunately, right after the end of warranty period, problems started occuring. First the antenna wouldn't go up and down no more, fixed it for $90 (new motor, they didn't charge me labor b/c it was so close to warranty). Then the brakes showed up with problems. Warped disc was diagnosed as the culprit. Well, fixed that, but unfortunately the problem came back after a thousand miles. Sanded that baby down again, and of course, returned after 1k miles. I finally got so fed up, I dished out the dough for a new brake rotor ($400). 

On a trip to Yosemite, the radiator blew, $600. The interesting thing was, I just had the car serviced (90k mile tune-up) a week prior. Interesting coincidence. Anyways, I know that happens to radiator sometimes, but I was disappointed nonetheless.

Right now, here are a list of minor/major problems with the car:

PRND321 - the D doesn't lite up no more.

Front driver side window - comes up rather slowly, suspect motor about to go soon.

Sun/Moon Roof - won't close properly unless you "play" around with it a bit. So I just stopped using it all together. Dealer said for diagnosis, have to take stuff apart, costs $$$. Told them to bite me.

Steering wheel - shakes a bit, but is thought to be due to unbalanced tires. We'll see.

So enough about the complaints, lots of good stuff to go along with the negative.

The gas mileage remains to be superb at 31mpg on highway and 24mpg in the city. Just as good as in day 1. And I keep constant track, I guarantee this part.

The engine still runs beautifully. No weird noises, horsepower still good. Engine still enjoys high revvvving.

Perhaps my problems aren't that big of a deal. But somehow I didn't expect this many of them from Acura. I know my Accord didn't.
