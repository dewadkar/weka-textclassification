            You might want to consider reading the facts on this camera before you decide on purchasing it. The reason why I was so caught up in this camera was that it has built in lithium batteries that charges internally via USB cable. Of course like any other smart cost efficient buyer out there, I choose this path and boy was I disappointed. Maybe it was all those Vivatar's, Samsungs and even Kodak's that filled my heart up with such quality photos I might of had too high of an expectation for this camera.

Don't intend on making this a primary camera, I wouldn&#146t. If you&#146re a beginner, there are so many under $100 cameras that shoot a lot better than this. I would strongly suggest you pass on this camera if you want quality and durability. Anyways for those who want to purchase this camera, check out some other places where they may sell it at pennies on a dollar. I purchased mine during its special offer for merely $49.99 at outpost.com. For that amount I guess you can say I had gotten a steal. If you&#146re really considering paying the price of $99.99, you might have a different opinion when it impacts your pockets a little bit more.

It has a small screen that tells you the battery life, and once you plug in the USB cable it displays the percentage of the charge. The camera operates completely to the software you install that is an application to retrieve and delete photos. This software is included in the CDROM that should have installed an icon on your desktop called "Oregon Scientific Photo Album". It may be little bit tricky to delete photos so I just do it by that primary software. The manual is ridiculously long for a camera so small so I passed on the idea of reading it, urgh maybe you might have more patience than me. All I need to know are the basics, which is all I want to know at my state of disappointment. It might suit you better, so I broke in down a little bit more.

-=PROS in Detail=-

- Recommended for concert outgoes and travelers. You can sneak in a concert with a slim chance of getting caught. So small it may fit in your wallet. If you happen to bump into a detector however, that wouldn't work but you can always try your luck. Psst! Don't tell anyone I said that! 

- You don't need batteries! YES! That's right; charge it via USB cable and your set to take on more shots.

- Cost is fairly good depending on its use.

-=CONS in Detail=-

- Durability isn't so great. For it being the size of a credit card, it just might break as easily. Can you really blame it? Unless they invented credit card sized Steel cameras, it&#146s unavoidable for a camera this small.

- Quality of photos comes out blurry. I recommend you take it out during the day outside, inside however the autobrite technology only works so insignificantly to compensate the lack of light. There isn't any flash at all I'm afraid.

- Shutter takes a few seconds before taking the photo. You have to hold the button for a couple of seconds before it actually takes the photo.
