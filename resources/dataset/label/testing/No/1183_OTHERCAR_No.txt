            Hello all i am mechanic by trade at a small shop in ky just up from a large Dodge dealership so I do see alot of these cars they do have a kinda of sporty look and seem to drive perform well for the first 30 000 miles or so but they all seem to have the same problem with the 2.0 ltr engine they develop a oil leak from the head gaskett and as anyone knows this is a expensive repair and even once fixed they will leak again in the same place this is definatly a problem no one wants the cars allso make a lot of noise from the rear brakes caused by brake dust they must be cleaned &amp; adjusted freqaitly to keep this from driving you crazy I would not reccomend this car to anyone unless it is give to them so if you want to have a headache buy a neon <br><br>
