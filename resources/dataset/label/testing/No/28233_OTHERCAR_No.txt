            I leased my 1999 Durango SLT Plus in April of 99. It was the
top of line (leather, CD Player, 3rd Seat, Overhead Console)
I chose this truck over the Ford Expedition (too expensive),
GMC Yukon & Chevy Tahoe (No 3rd Seat in 1999). The Durango is a nice looking truck with a powerful V8 and has many nice features, but it has some drawbacks. Gas mileage is terrible, I can't believe Chrysler still uses a throttle body instead of electronic fuel injection. Four wheel disc brakes and coil springs all around would have been better. I never had a new vehicle that failed its first emissions inspection before. The dealership claimed it was fouled spark plugs, and slapped the sticker on it then sent me home. The fog lights stopped working, the truck constantly has spark knock when driving uphill, even using 89 octane. I keep wondering what will happen next. Why does Chrysler keep using that cheap paint, the clear coat has already started to flake in some areas. I would recommend waiting until Dodge works the kinks out, and catches up to GM, 
Ford, Toyota, or Nissan in the automotive technology arena.
08/11/02 Latest update - The thermostat gasket developed a leak and we gradually lost all of the antifreeze. The truck also developed a case of what the dealership called "idle surge", which is when the truck revs itself up to 3500 RPM
when you are waiting at a stop light. There were some computer updates that the dealership needed to make in order to fix the spark knock and idle surge, which were still covered under warranty. 01/10/04 - Latest update, truck failed inspection again. With 56,000 miles on it, the dealership claims that the lower ball joints were shot. Also, the thermostat gasket had to be replaced a second time. The truck still has spark knock. I can't wait to trade this in.
