            I bought the camera because I wanted an inexpensive digital camera to send an e-mail photo of myself to e-mail pals in Poland and Korea.  I liked the self-timer feature.  The quality of the photo was okay if all you wanted to send was a 2 x 3 inch picture with minimal resolution.  The batteries drain very quickly, making the $50 &quot;optional&quot; AC adaptor mandatory.  It is a very cute camera and very easy to use.  I just needed much better picture resolution and to not have to fool with using a power adaptor.  I took the camera back and plan to buy one with removable storage, zoom, and better adjustments for image quality.  I have received e-mail attachments of very superior photos where only a scanner has been used.  Photo developers put your 35 mm negatives on CD-ROM for $8 or thereabouts, so there are plenty of other options besides a digital camera.<br><br>
