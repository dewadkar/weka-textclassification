            I had the choice of buying a used Honda or a new Cavalier. Unfortunately, I chose the Cavalier.

As a college student, I didn't have a lot of money so the Cavalier was about the only new car I could afford (I saw new as a big plus because of the warranty). On the plus side, it has a lot of trunk space for a compact car and it's even kind of sporty-looking. The engine isn't bad either -- I drove a Neon and could barely get it up to 65 flooring it on an on-ramp. 

The main fact that has marred my Cavalier experience is the noise. It started in the brake pedal and it took them several visits over a one-year period to fix. Then noises in the dash, the seatbelt, and the vents. The dealer hasn't been very helpful and it is extremely unlikely that I will buy another Chevrolet.

If you're tight on cash, get a used car, not a cheap new one.<br>
