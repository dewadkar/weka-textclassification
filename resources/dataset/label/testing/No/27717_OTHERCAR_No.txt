            Without doubt this is a stylish and desirable compact digital camera. Once you hold it in my hand you would want to buy it. The design is very sleek and the metal body ooze quality. Ergonomics is excellent. All the buttons and compartments for the Compact Flash card and battery are cleverly arranged. There is an optical viewfinder as well as a bright LCD screen.

The picture quality is definitely up to scratch. 6x4 inch prints taken in 1600x1200 resolution and printed by local high street photo shop is excellent. It is as good as quality 35mm compact camera. Picture sharpness and contrast is good. Color is vibrant. Pin cushion effect of the lens is as any other like it. Compare to the early APS version that Canon also make in very similar design made the film version photographs a total shame. On the other hand the picture quality is no better then many other 2.1 MB camera likes Canon S10 or others that are cheaper. Neither it is in the league of models that cost slightly more. 

This is my first digicam so some of my difficulty with this camera could be due to having to learn new technique that comes with digital photography and personal perceive limitation. Firstly, I find the response time very slow. Taking posed pictures is fine but I could not have that instant reaction. The shutter is slow enough for an event not to be captured as you press the release button but a faction of a second later. Sometimes long enough for that vital moment in time to be lost forever.  

The optical rangefinder is also not very accurate. It let you see 70% of the actual picture only. There is also parallax error. The LCD screen is better giving an electronic through the lens view and I get more accurate framing with it. However, with this switch on it consumes power quickly. You need to recharge the battery daily when you are out snapping like on tour. You will require a source of mains power always nearby with this amount of power requirement. It is so small that you wish to take it camping or hill walking for days with but it is not viable unless you bring along big and heavy power pack too. One addition problem is that on bright daylight the picture seems to take on a bluish tint. Not take a difficult problem that Photoshop could not correct. 

The package is good. You get a 8MB CF card, one lithium ion battery and charger with 2 choices of plugs. I find that useful when traveling in Europe. Using USB connection is fast and convenient when use together with the software provided. It is very easy to set up and download pictures. Adobe Photoshop 5 LE is also provided which comes useful and seems to add to the experience of digital photography as you can edit your photos to heart content.



p.s. I have been experimenting with the shutter lag problem and find out that if you half press the release button and let it focus first before taking a picture this is improved to a degree.   

For the same price you could also consider a wonderful pocketable 35mm film camera but allows more control. Read other review on Nikon 35Ti <a href='/elec-review-3134-5C7F0AE-39FBD46E-prod1'>http://www.epinions.com/elec-review-3134-5C7F0AE-39FBD46E-prod1</a>
