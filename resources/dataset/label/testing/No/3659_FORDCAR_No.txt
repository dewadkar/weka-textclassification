            The Crown Victoria is a breed that's siblings are dying fast. The only major competetors in it's category is the Lincoln Town Car and the Ill fated Chevrolet Caprice Classic. It's twin the Mercury Gran Marquis shares many of the same characteristics as the crown vic. Acceleration is very sluggish for a car of it's heft. The underpowered v-6 whines when the gas pedal is pushed. Where it lack's in perofrmance it is justified by the comfort and roominess, All ergonomics are well placed and simple. This car is designed for the grandma that hates &quot;All Those Gadgets&quot; It's forward bench seat is comfortable and squishy. But firm enough to support your grandma's Aching Hips. If you are still in your prime years I would stay away from this car unless you like the bulky fleet car look. <br><br>
