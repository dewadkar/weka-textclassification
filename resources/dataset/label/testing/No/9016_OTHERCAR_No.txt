            I purchased this vehicle because it met all of my needs.  It had 4 wheel drive, could carry more than two passengers, was not a small vehicle, and I could get in and out easily.

The Kia is cute and I enjoy driving the Kia.  It's like driving a pickup which I like.

This vehicle seems to keep falling apart.  
I have less than 40,000 miles in 1 and 1/2 years.  
   update - I now have 45,000 miles on it.

It has been out of service for seven total days (this was in the first six months).  I have made approximately 10-12 trips (160 miles round trip, plus numerous days off) to have the KIA serviced.  
   update - I have made about 3 more trips

I have spoken to the service manager and requested that a KIA representative contact me and there has been little attempt to reach me.  I have contacted KIA consumer line and was told they could not help me.  I have come to despise the KIA name.  
   update - notified BBB and KIA, I have to perform hours of paper work to declare the lemon law to be told I have too many miles.
   update - No representative has contacted me as of yet.

The 4 wheel drive has gone out twice
Brakes have gone out twice
Steering wheel cover came off
There's already a tail light out
The battery went bad and had to be replaced (this was an ordeal in itself)
There was a recall on an electronic part that had to be replaced
Both back doors had to be resealed
The wheel well on the rear end had to be replaced as it got stuck
The heater box had to be replaced, 
   update - now it makes a lot of noise and is once again heating in the wrong place.
The windshield wipers had to be replaced, 
The front door needs to be resealed as it wore out
   update - one side was fixed and now the other needs it

Update - Recall on a part on the cadallic converter - after being repaired on a Friday night, drove off and about 5:30 p.m. the engine light came on and didn't go back off until Monday morning.

Update - the KIA rattles and shakes like its coming apart.

Update - the passenger window doesn't want to roll up.

Update - 11/8/00 The 4 X 4 seems to have gone out again.  I put it in 4 Low this morning and I no longer had park available.  The gears were grinding and making awful noise.

11/16/00 I took the KIA in to double check the 4 x 4, and the transmission, they said it was fine.  The heaterbox needs to be replaced again (makes tremendous amounts of noise).    The KIA is making so much noise I can't even tell where it's coming from any more.

I don't know who to take it to to be serviced.  I can't even find someone who can tell me exactly what the extended warranty covers.

I'm not even sure this has been all of it.  It takes almost three attempts to get something fixed, it can't be serviced except in areas where sold.

Since KIA is so unreliable they have to keep selling the dealership and moving on.  Maybe it's so no one can find them.


No one should buy this vehicle.  EVER EVER EVER EVER
