            My husband thinks our Blazer is roomy, but it's not.  I almost hit my head on the ceiling and I'm only 5'6&quot;.  Our kids, 13 and 10, have no leg room in the back seat and we can't take it on long trips because of this.  It doesn't get very good gas mileage, 20 mpg if we're lucky.  It was very expensive and we can hardly afford the monthly payments.  

There are a few things I like about it: the seats automatically adjust to drivers #1 and #2; there is a sun roof, CD player, leather seats, 4 wheel-drive, LOTS of room in the back storage area, it drives easily and rides smooth, the lights automatically come on with ignition, it has keyless entry and alarm.  

I'm sure glad he drives it all the time and not me, but when I have to drive it I don't complain much.  I would recommend the Blazer for people who aren't very tall and won't have tall passengers, who don't care about price or gas mileage and want 4 wheel drive and lots of space for gear.  <br><br>
