            In the UK, the Honda Civic, has very much become a car that you see middle-aged women driving. Perhaps this isn't the case in countries abroad, but just how it is over in England. The car looks like a sports car, but then it also looks so small. When we drove in a Civic Exi, the first thing I couldn't help but notice was how very feeble the engine sounded - like the car was operated by a lawnmower motor (but as always we should consider that as the price rises so to would the engine capacity)
The good points would be that, Honda has grown to be a reputable manufacturer in the UK, as have Toyota and Subaru, the other commonly bought alternatives. The model features a passenger/driver airbag, remote central locking, ABS, climate control, rear split fold seats, electric windows/mirrors/sunroof, and an adaquetly sized boot.
On driving the car you realise that without that rear windscreen wiper, it is really impossible to safely reverse in rain or snow. Another really annoying problem was that when the heating got turned on, regardless of the weather conditions, it kept steaming up the whole car, reducing the visibility  hugely. 
But I suppose that, you get what you pay for, and the Civic does suffer from it's flaws, it is still a reasonably good looking and reliable car.<br><br>
