            The DC-3400 is a sleek looking camera which was easy to use without reading the manual (something I like in a camera). The menu on the LCD were colorful and very "cute". When I first popped in some batteries and looked at the screen I was very pleased with the display and usability. It took me a few minutes to get the hang of making adjustments. I found myself cleaning the LCD however because I kept on touching it. I think this happens will all digital cameras with a screen. 

The camera came with a cable to connect to your PC and some really basic software. I had a little trouble getting the software to work, but it's probably because I have so many things hooked up to my computer it is bound to cause some conflicts. I don't think many people will have this problem.

Overall the picture quality was great. If you decide to buy this camera there are a few things that you will have to keep in mind. These things may not bother you depending on you needs, but they were fairly important for me. I take a lot of picture with my SLR and I use my digital camera as a proof shot camera to give me an idea of what my pictures will come out. First, I really hate the lens cap. It popped off way too easily. Although you can't lose it because it has a strap connected to the camera itself, if you put it into a case or just let it rub against you as you walked, it would pop off. Very annoying, especially since you can't put a filter on the camera to protect the lens. The second thing which I found annoying is that the close up pictures were poor in quality. This is especially true if you needed to use the flash in close up mode. The flash was way overpowered and would wash out all of the color. I don't know if this camera can adjust the flash output depending on the subjects distance, but I don't think it does. Flash output needs to be dropped considerable for close ups. The third problem is the incredibly short battery life. Although much longer than my older Ricoh digital camera, it is still way too short for my tastes. If you need to take pictures with flash you better carry a lot of spare batteries. I found myself keeping the LCD off and using the viewfinder in order to conserve battery power. My friend has a Canon S100 which runs off a Canon camcorder battery and he can take tons of pictures and not worry about battery power. Plus it recharges quickly. I tried to use metal hydride batteries in the Kodak and that helped, but still too short. The only good aspect about a short battery life is that unless you get a memory card with more than the 8meg standard, you will fill up the card before the battery runs out anyway.

The size of the camera is also a bit large for my tastes. Its bigger than a lot of 35mm point and shoots. However, this isn't really a big deal for most people who like something substantial in their hands. It was a problem for me because I am usually carrying a lot of SLR bodies and lens and I grew tired of the Kodak's size and weight. 

Although this review may seem very negative, it's only because the camera didn't suit my personal needs. The pictures this thing took were very sharp. I was very pleased with the quality of the pictures (you just can't fit a whole lot of high resolution pictures on an 8 meg card). What's neat about this camera is that you can display your pictures directly to a TV (like what you do with camcorders). I didn't use this feature too often because I usually just downloaded the picture to my laptop.

I also noticed that you can't take many pictures in rapid succession. I guess it took a while to save the picture to the card. 

In the end I sold the camera and bought a Canon S100. I liked it's battery life and size a lot better. However, the Kodak is a great little camera. I got a great deal on the Kodak so I felt the value was great. As a final note, it was an extremely easy to use camera and the interface was the best I have seen.
