            I bought a 1997 Kia Sephia GL in Jan. 1998 and it was in the shop by Feb. of 1998. I had the brakes and rotors replaced 4 times with 3 months. I had a new dash put within the first year that I had it. All seals on the doors were replaced. Had 3 new batteries within the first 5 months. Had 2 new starters within 6 months of purchase. Had a new door handle placed on the rear right door. There was a clicking noise in the engine that they could not fix. There were other minor problems that were wrong with the car also. I call the Regional Manager for Kia and told him my story and all the problems I have had. We decided on they would repurchase my car back from me if I would buy a 2000 Kia from them. I told them yes, and bought the other car. As soon as the title was in my name and the bank paper work went through I traded the car in at other dealership and got the HELL away from KIA. They are the worst car on the market. The driving experience of the car was not the greatest. I would not recommend anyone to own this kind of car.
