            I bought a new 2000 Grand AM GT in June of 2000.  I was so happy you have no idea.  I was so in love with these vehicle of mine.  It was attractive, sleek, and pretty fast.  Why wouldn't I want to buy one of these especially when it is only 21,000 dollars.  

Well, lets just say that I don't like it anymore because I no longer have the vehicle.  It has an accident and it was do to the fact the vehicle is front wheel drive.  All the weight of the car is in the front which makes the rear prone to spin out.  Otherwise the car drives great.  

It had a 175 horsepower engine which flew because this car was so light.  It got great gas mileage and it could comfortably seat 4 people.  I guess this actually is a good vehicle and many people are very happy with.  The drive of the car is very good, again except of the fact that the rear is prone to spinning out.  

This car is great for anyone who wants a sporty looking car that is not classified as a sports car.  I very much like the car's appearance, but buyers beware.  The handling under certain conditions leaves a lot to be desired.<br><br>
