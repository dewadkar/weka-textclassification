            In the beginning, say around 1995, Casio was one of three companies I found to have a reasonably affordable digital camera on the market.  Kodak and one other company, which I can't recall, had products which I looked and considered purchasing.  At that time I selected the Casio QV-10 with its compact take anywhere size, clear LCD screen and memory enough for 96 300 x 300 pixel photos. The one concern I had was it's toyish, plastic body.

The camera got a lot of attention when I used it, and most were in awe of its digital capabilities.  The software was very user friendly as well.  At that time, I whole heatedly endorsed the product, gave it rave reviews and recommended it to others as the camera to buy.

It was not with its problems.  While I found it to be wonderful in low light situations, situations with a lot of light caused very poor pictures , either washing them out, creating lined highlights or adding a green tinge to the photo. 

While electronically it was a durable piece of equipment mechanically it was not.  Switches are cheap, and the types used for various functions not hold up well over time if extensively used.

Within 9 months the original camera was returned due tot he on-off switch breaking.  In less than another year the record/play button began to malfunction.  My initial  thoughts on the body were confirmed, you don't want to drop this plastic case.  The battery storage door latch has also broken.  Imagine your are doing a business photo shoot when suddenly the batteries drop to the floor.  Your camera will look great with a rubber band accessorizing it to keep the batteries in the camera.

Casio has not backed their product when bringing these problems to their attention.

I have watched as Casio has made changes, and looked at the models developed since the QV-10.  I see little to correct the technical problems which I experienced.

In comparison to other companies with digital cameras on the market, who use metal bodies, higher quality switches, and removable storage media, I would have to say that Casio, whether it be it's QV-10A Model or other more advanced models with more advanced bells and whistles, has gone from being a leader to follower in bringing digital products to the market.

I paid nearly $1,000 for this product when it came out on market, today I wouldn't even consider it for under $200.         <br><br>
