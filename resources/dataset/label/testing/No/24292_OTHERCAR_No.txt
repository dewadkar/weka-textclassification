            I was in the market for a Jeep Grand Cherokee back in 1997.  I found what I thought was my &quot;dream car&quot;.  I bought a used 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo from a local dealer.  Right from the start, before I took it off the parking lot I had problems.  I even went so far as to cancel my check I had written for the down payment.  But, they promised they would fix things.  Less than 3 years later I had put over $7,000 in repairs to that car.  The Warranty paid for some, but I was out a lot of money, time, and effort.

I replaced the &quot;rear end&quot; twice (within 4 months).  The oil pan gasket had to be replaced 3 times.  The valve cover gaskets 3 times.  Also the head gasket 1 time.  There were numerous other problems.

I certainly realize now that I bought someone else's problems. 

I did like the sportiness of the car and it handled well.  I just couldn't keep it out of the shop.

The problems that I had with my Jeep kept me from buying a new Jeep when I decided to buy my first new car.  I bought a Dodge Durango instead and I love it.<br><br>
