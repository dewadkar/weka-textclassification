            In May of 1999, it as time for me to get a new lease on an economy-class car. I looked and looked for days, finally I found myself at Dan Young Chevrolet. I was actually interested in a used car for lease, but was drawn to the new Cavaliers. 
A salesman approached me and offered a test drive to me. I was not sure I was ready for that. I wanted numbers before I got too set on a vehicle. I came to find the numbers ran perfect for me on a base model with sunroof and CD player.
This was perfect, a car with the extras I liked, but no more than I needed. As I am a Domestic Engineer (aka Homemaker).
This is a good car to get me where I need to be, short distances to places like the grocery store. However, I would not recommend this car for long distance driving. The seats are firm and have no lumbar support. Driving from Indianapolis to Cincinnati was an actual pain-staking experience. 
If i was going to recommend this car to anyone- it would be to a young first time buyer, maybe a student who doesn't have a long commute to school.
I do think this car has an excellent sound system, with it having an am/fm stereo/CD player. There is good truck space as well, and the pull down back seal gives even more space for luggage and/or groceries.<br><br>
