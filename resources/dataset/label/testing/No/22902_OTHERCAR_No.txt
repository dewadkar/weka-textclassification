            I bought the 2500 5.9L to haul my property and such across country.  As a student I bought this truck with just over 12,000 miles, figuring it would last me through college.  I've never been rough on the vehicle, yet at just over 41,000 miles the differential and transmission went out.  The truck is a stiff drive but that is expected from a heavy duty.  I really like the leg and headroom.  The engine is a great performer.  However, a truck as pampered as mine should not have broken down so soon.  Also, try out the truck on hills and freeways to evaluate the gear ratio and change.  I have not been impressed with the gear ratio selection.  Second is overused while, changing from second to third is too quick. Hauling, towing, passing, or climbing--you will never use third.  It shifts almost directly from OD to second.<br><br>
