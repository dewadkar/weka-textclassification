            We bought a '98 A4 Avant (station wagon) with the 2.8L V6 and automatic (fwd only) after waiting in vain for the VW Passat equivalent to come out. (At the time they had problems putting the V6 into the Passat wagon.)We bought the car because it combines performance and utility and is, without a doubt, the most handsome wagon on the road.

You should be aware that this is a small car. It is slightly smaller than the VW equivalent and much more expensive. I'm 6'7&quot; and was head-over-heals with the car when we bought it. The love affair turned into a love-hate relationship when stopped wearing those rose-rimmed glasses somewhere along the line and routinely had to tweak the seat into that one position that actually fit me passibly. Forget about even a child sitting behind me.

The car had way too many small problems. During the first 6 months of ownership we returned it to the dealer for approximately 15 separate problems. One problem in particular (the handbrake grip breaking loose) also occurred in my mother-in-law's A4. In all fairness, the dealership's ineptitude was probably to blame for many of the faults. They'd fix one thing and break or forget to reinstall or tighten another. Unfortunately, unlike with a Ford or GM, there was only one Audi dealer in the vicinity.

When we decided to replace ~1 year later, we found that the trade-in value was ludicrous. Selling it privately took MUCH longer than I'd anticipated. Again, on the up-side, the new owner (whom I've stayed in touch with) has had a great ownership experience so far.

My recommendation, if you have to have it over the Passat, buy it used. That way someone else (like us) has already worked out the kinks.<br><br>
