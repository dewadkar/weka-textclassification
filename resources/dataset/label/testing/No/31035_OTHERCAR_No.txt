            I have always believed in Nissan products but this 200SX may change my mind. I bought this car a little over a year ago with the thought that this would be a great little car for me to drive everywhere and for a long time. This is my third Nissan car and I have always been amazed at there ability to go long distances with out any major mechanical work and always start on cold Maine winter mornings! 
I was shopping for a new car after I was in an accident with my beloved 1987 Nissan Maxima. The Maxima was great but I when I was shopping for a new car I wanted something that was a little better on gas because I was going to be traveling quite a bit. So I shopped for days and days to find a car I liked. The last day I came across a black 1995 Nissan 2000SX with all the options � power windows, power moon-roof, cruise, power windows, CD player, low miles etc.  

I got the car with 61,000 miles on it and now it has 91,000 in a little over a year. I have encountered a few things that really, really, make me angry however. After a bad winter with the car it started to develop rust around the rear wheel well and in one of the door jams. I am really disappointed by this because it was the first car I had ever bought that did not have rust on it when I got it. Now it has rust and in such a short amount of time! I took very well care of the car to make sure this did not happen; I washed it 2-3 times a week! The dashboard lights flicker on and off when they want, this has proved to be a frightening experience when it is pitch black out and your driving down a back road and all of a sudden you cant see anything in your car! A few pounds on the dash make them come back to life. The rear defroster does not work at all except two little strips on the bottom of the rear windshield and some of the console lights that illuminate the hazard button and rear defroster button do not work. 

The power window on my side has to be �nudged� to get it to go up but I think this may be due to the Ventashields that I installed on the car. Ventishields are plastic windbreakers that go on the side of the windows on the car. (I will be doing a review on them soon!) I have also had the clutch adjusted three times and it still feels odd. My mechanic tells me that the clutch is fine but I am worried that there is something wrong with it. I am very anal about keeping up with the maintenance on the car and I never miss any oil changes. I have not had the car mechanically break down on me but has been in the shop to have general maintenance done on it. I have replaced all the drive belts, new battery, break work, and that is about it. 

I find that the interior has held up OK but not exceptionally. The foam in my seat has began to loose it shape and part of the stitching on my seat is coming undone in the back. The seats are only comfortable for and hour or so, and I often find myself adjusting the seat position to find a more comfortable way to sit. Everything inside the car is laid out well except for the cup holders that wont fit anything except a 12oz can of soda and is located right in front of the radio which makes it prone to getting spilled on. The rear seats in the car are starting to fade into a purple color (originally black) from the sun; I can only imagine what they would look like if I lived some place hot and not in Maine. The carpets in the car look okay except on the passenger side where there seems to be a little bolt underneath the carpet, which has caused a hole to form.  If you are thinking about putting any sort of subwoofer into the car make sure that you get the trunk well insulated because it rattles and that goes for the rear deck also.
