            I traded in a beat up Ford Tempo and got a pretty good deal on my Mirage. However 6 months after buying this vehicle, the brakes started squealing very bad and when I took it in under the warranty, I was told there was nothing I could do, that all Mitsubishi's had these certain type of brakes. Well now I have had the car for almost 2 years and the brakes are still squealing, even after replacing them.

 Also there is another squealing noise that sounds like the belt is loose...but once again, I took it in and this time they tell me they don't know what it is, that they didn't find anything wrong with it. Everyday, as I get into my cute, somewhat stylish car I dread cranking it up, afraid of what will happen next.
 For a car that is only 2 years old, it is a shame that it has so many problems. I am just looking forward to the day I can finally purchase a car that doesn't break down every month. If you want to buy a good vehicle, I recommend that you drive past Mitsubishi without looking back.  <br><br>
