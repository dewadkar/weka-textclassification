            My Grand Cherokee Laredo was to be the &quot;forever-after&quot; vehicle as I wanted something dependable, trustworthy, rugged, solid, yada-yada for the next several years and beyond.  So we shopped and compared and haggled and negotiated ... and I bought it brand-spanking-new and prepared for a long, wonderful relationship.  

When the fuel gauge recall was announced, I promptly complied only to begin a series of gut-wrenching almost-killed-myself events.  First, the gauge was installed incorrectly which prompted the dealer to remove the fuel tank.  The tank was put back on incorrectly and the next time I bought gas, about 2 gallons of it flowed over the top of the tank and onto the pavement at the gasoline station.  This of course prompted the local fire department to come and wash down everything, all the time warning me that my vehicle might go up in flames at any minute.  After that harrowing experience, I had the SUV towed to the dealer (at their expense) and &quot;Jerry&quot; (our name for the Jeep) sat in their service bay for almost two weeks.  Seems they couldn't find a qualified technician to deal with the problem.  

Once that was finally fixed, Jerry performed pretty well.  One day his sunroof got stuck in the &quot;open&quot; position ... another time his turn signals wouldn't work ... and then the squeaks began.  Rattle, rattle, click, click, squeak, squawk ... no amount of WD-40, silicon or 3-in-1 oil (heck, I even tried vegetable spray) will eliminate the various pieces of plastic and vinyl that rub together and cause this cacophony of torture.  So we crank up the CDs and drown it out.  

Then at 70,000 miles, the whine set in.  Sort of a low, moaning, guttural whine that rises to a fever pitch around 20 mph and then slowly dissipates.  The service manager admits to being a little stumped, but thinks it's probably the front axle or maybe the rotors or maybe the differential or maybe the ...  So Jerry has an appointment later this week to check his whine. 

In the meantime, I'm whining myself.  Yes, he's been safe and dependable to a degree, but all of these (and others I didn't mention) minor problems have caused me to rethink my next purchase.  I doubt that I'll buy another Jeep.  We'll miss Jerry, but not much.<br><br>
