            I was in Texas this past week and rented a Chevy Prism from Enterprise.
I only needed a compact car since it was for me and my 3 year old and loved this car right away! 

It had a CD player, cruise, elec locks, airbags.....comfortable seats and good stereo speakers.

It did get good gas mileage. I drove about 1200 miles and spent $45 on gas.

But....when we got on 45 south going to Houston from Dallas-I had to arm wrestle with the car and wind...I was ALL over the road! I was scared! I thought any minute the car would flip over!

The car I own in Colorado is a mid size car-Mazda 626. Who knows if it would have done the same thing as this car. But never in my life have I felt that afraid! 

My arms are sore now....

And the car made sounds-as if parts of it were falling off!
