            Why I bought it: I was too strapped to afford anything else. This was a hand-me-down from my mom, who put about 30000 miles on it, and sold it to me for around $8000 ($200/month payments). Now that I'm paid off, it has over 65000 miles and is probably only worth around $3500 wholesale. Soon I'll hopefully be trading it in on a PT Cruiser or something nicer....

Love:  Good A/C (important in Texas!), power everything, roomy 4-door, decent size trunk (though a bit shallow &amp; no pass-thru). 3.1 liter V6 gets OK mileage (20-ish) but has enough oomph to get on the freeway quickly. Fairly decent factory AM/FM/tape deck, gets pretty good bass from the largish trunk-passthru-mounted rear speakers. Not as hard to park as a full-size luxobomber (I learned parallel parking in Chicago on my first car, a Ford LTD cop-style sedan). Quite resilient paint job (though the medium metallic blue color is only so-so); despite some serious dents, scratches &amp; dings to bodywork and very infrequent washes, it's still pretty bright w/no rust or flaking off. Had enough power to tow a decently loaded U-Haul trailer back and forth between Dallas and Houston at 65+ on the highway.

Hate:  First month I got it I had to get the tranny rebuilt, to the tune of over $1000. The idiots at the tranny shop drained my battery dry, which then led to my starter &amp; alternator needing replacements (once, it died right on the freeway). Plus the tranny still won't shift as quickly as I'd like. Very mushy suspension leads to poor handling, and the front end won't stay aligned (probably the potholes etc. around here don't help though). Just recently dropped $200 on long-overdue brake job, and it still doesn't stop very quickly. Benchlike seats, even though driver has 8-way power adjustments, make sudden maneuvers feel more swervy. Plus no airbags and the horrible door-attached seatbelts make it seem like a deathtrap, especially to my wife. However, it has broken down far less than my previous car (Ford Escort GT) which was a nightmare. Crappy hubcaps and mediocre styling make it a bear to look at.

Driving:  Feels like piloting a motorboat more than driving a car, despite front-wheel drive. Then again, I'm more used to 4-banger sporty little things (various VW's, Escort GT, etc.) than &quot;Mom&quot; cars. Highway crusing is nice; with the cruise on you can go 80+ without feeling like you're really speeding. Speedo only goes up to 85 though....

Who should buy this:  anybody who needs basic transportation, doesn't care too much about looks, and wants a fairly reliable cheap ride that seats 4 with room to spare. I'd sell it to ya now but this ain't E-Bay ;-)

Who shouldn't buy this: anybody who wants to drive a sporty, flashy, status-symbol type car.  This is only 1 step above a minivan in &quot;cool&quot;.
