            I bought this car after I crashed my Camaro on a median strip. I had almost no money, and only 5 days to procure a car before I was fired from my pizza delivey job, so I jumped at the opportunity for a convertable, turbo with a manual transmission. The salesman was eager to get this thing off the lot, and finally let it go for $1300. Now I know why.

On the drive home from the lot, things began to go wrong. My wipers failed, the top fluttered up and down, and the headlights were tempermental. The speakers worked only on one side, and to top it off, it smelled like someone had been murdered inside it. I hated it the moment I got home.

The car actually performed alright. It was pretty light, and the turbocharger zipped that thing around like a pro. The transmission worked pretty well, and it held to the road better than most cars I've ever driven (still, it was no Camaro). So basically it preformed all the functions necissary. Over the summer it was useful enough to pay for itself at my job, and it got me where I needed to go during the day. It was fun to race people in, because everybody underestimates it. Nobody would suspect that this 12 year old baby little thing could pace a 2002 Corvette for almost a quarter mile. But it could.

Maybe it was psycological damage the car did to me, I don't know, but when I would go to shut the door, and the handle would come apart in my hands, when I wanted to blast my music and only one speaker worked, when i wanted to wipe the windshield and the wipers would jam, I would get annoyed. Finally, it got so bad that whenever someone would ask about my car I would grunt and shrug my shoulders. I began to loathe it.

Now I am trying to sell it, hopefully soon. I guess this car is alright if you have some money to keep it up, and for people who like to put money on races this car could drop some jaws the first couple of times. Just don't go on any long trips in it, unless you're trying to stay there.
