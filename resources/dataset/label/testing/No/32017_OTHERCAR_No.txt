            Back in the early �80s when every GM division was still allowed to try to be everything to everyone, Buick sold T-Type versions of many of its cars. In an attempt to appeal to young driving enthusiasts, these featured less chrome, charcoal interior and exterior trim, alloy wheels, and stiff suspensions. The Regal and Riv T-types even had a turbocharged V6. Though none of these was a big seller (with the partial exception of the Regal), some weren�t half-bad.

Then in the mid-80s GM ordered its divisions to stop competing with one another and focus on specific types of customers.  Buick�s new mission was to focus on those customers who desired the look and feel of a traditional American car. The T-Types did not fit this mission, and they went away. While Oldsmobile continues to flounder at its mission, going after import buyers, Buick actually did very well at its more familiar mission. The current Park Avenue and LeSabre fulfill the needs of traditional American car buyers very well. The flagship dealer where I went for the test drive even fit this mission. It was very nicely appointed, and had a hushed quality to it. It was so nicely targeted towards older, traditional buyers that I felt quite out of place there.

At the same time, Buick executives recognize that this mission cannot sustain it forever. People who like the look and feel of traditional American cars tend to be old, and they are dying off. If Buick is to survive well into the future, it must find a way to appeal to younger buyers. This became the mission of the Regal when it was redesigned for the 1997 model year.

<b>Styling and accommodations</b>

Complicating its mission, the Regal shares its sheetmetal, chassis, and interior with the Century. The main differences between the two lines are the Regal gets larger, more powerful engines, a sportier front end, and bucket seats with a console shifter. The plan is for the Century to appeal to older buyers who want a luxury brand at a Chevrolet price and for the Regal to appeal to younger buyers who want a quick, luxurious family sedan. Can the same basic car appeal to such different buyers?

The Regal must also compete with other GM sedans for buyers. The Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Intrigue have similar targets. How does the Regal differ from these? Does it differ much at all? Plenty of people will tell you that all GM cars are alike.

Well, the Regal and Grand Prix (GT and GTP) share the same engines. The Regal LS and Grand Prix GT share a 200 horsepower 3.8 liter V6, and the Regal GS and Grand Prix GTP share a 240 horsepower supercharged version of that engine. The Buick and Pontiac differ mostly in styling. The Grand Prix has lower, sleeker lines and racier interior styling, with red lighting and lots of charcoal buttons. Inside and outside, the GP is quite macho. The Regal�s exterior and interior are much less sporty, even in black, a color commonly seen on the GS. I suspect it�s intended more for women than the GP is. In the Regal�s favor, its taller roofline enables a higher driver�s seat and a better positioned, roomier rear seat.

While both the Pontiac and Buick are going after domestic car buyers, the Intrigue is designed to compete with the imports. Its only engine is a 3.5 liter DOHC six. Though less powerful than the supercharged six in the Regal, it�s more refined. The Intrigue�s interior borrows many details from Honda and Toyota, and its general styling theme comes from Lexus. From the driver�s seat, the Buick and Oldsmobile seem very different.

Throw all of this together, and the Regal gets its positioning as �the sedan for the supercharged family.� As a marketing professor, I actually like this theme. It succinctly identifies the focus of the car as a family sedan with the unique attribute of a supercharged engine. It�s not going after single men or retired people. In line with this positioning, the Regal has been marketed heavily towards women in their 30s and 40s by sponsoring events such as the Women�s NBA. My wife is part of the target market, and she�s a huge WNBA fan. So far so good. But is the car up to this task? I test drove a loaded Regal GS to find out.

I�ve already said quite a bit about the Regal�s exterior and interior, so I�ll just mention my additional impressions from the test drive. The exterior styling does well enough. Though I still prefer the lines of the Intrigue and Grand Prix, I still find the Regal attractive. 

Until I get inside. Sharing a dash with the higher-volume, geriatric Century hurts. I cannot believe this is the same basic car as my wife�s Intrigue. The dash looks like something out of the past. It�s tall and bulky, and something about the materials just screams �old.� The design of the controls doesn�t help. The worst is the headlamp control, one of those old pull knobs. Feels very cheap. The HVAC controls are a bunch of identical rectangular buttons. Far from the leading edge of design. The instruments, which use a large, plain font to appeal to failing eyes, look old and cheap. Many of the plastics, most notably those covering flat surfaces along the face of the dash, have a budget look and feel. They are out of place in a luxury brand.

The seats are larger and much softer than those in the Intrigue and Grand Prix. The leather has that loosely gathered look. Most people will find them comfortable, with one exception. The headrests, which are open in the center like those in the Grand Prix and in some German cars of the past (and which look out of place in this interior), are not a comfortable place to rest one�s head. There is plenty of space in front, just adequate space in the rear. The front seats could easily be redesigned to free up knee room for rear passengers. The rear seat folds down in two sections to expand a fairly large trunk.

<b>On the road</b>

The main reason I tested this car was to check out the supercharged engine that is standard in the GS (that and to get a $100 WNBA merchandise certificate for my wife). My wife�s Intrigue is a �98, so it has the regular 3.8 liter that is standard in the Regal LS. I was interested in how much difference the supercharger makes. Well, the extra horses are detectable, and the supercharged engine definitely produces healthy amounts of low-end torque (280 lbs.ft. @ 3600). But overall the difference was less than I expected. My wife�s Intrigue has never felt weak, and I cannot say I ended my test drive desiring the supercharged engine. Especially since it requires premium unleaded.

What I did end my test drive desiring was a suspension more like that in the Intrigue. Though the Regal GS has a stiffer suspension than that in the Regal LS, which has a stiffer suspension than that in the Century, the suspension in the GS is still pretty soft. This gives the car a better ride than you�ll find in the Intrigue (the Regal is quieter as well), but too much at the expense of handling. The 225/60R16 tires (same size as in the Intrigue and Grand Prix) may stick well, but sticky tires alone do not make a driver�s car. The Regal�s ride is far too floaty for my taste, and the car leans a lot around turns. Overall, the suspension lacked polish. It did not control body motions nearly as well as the suspension in the Intrigue, permitting many small untoward bobs and wobbles. You know, like in traditional Detroit iron.

The steering in the Regal also leaves a lot to be desired. It has a loose, rubbery feel, worlds different from the firm, connected feel of the Intrigue�s steering. Together with the soft suspension and dated interior styling, this steering makes the Regal feel like a much larger, much less maneuverable car than the Intrigue (which through the wheel feels considerably smaller and lighter than it is). Though I know otherwise, based on driving feel alone I find it very hard to believe that the Regal and Intrigue are basically the same car.

<b>Last words</b>

Many people claim that all GM sedans are alike. After driving the Regal, I can unequivocally state that they are not. I�m still in shock at the degree of difference between the Regal and Intrigue. The supercharged engine is not enough of a plus to make the Regal a desirable car. Its interior and chassis, which recall Buicks of the distant past, are not well suited for the intended market. I�m not sure they�re well-suited for any market, even the old folks who buy Centuries. This is a shame, because the Regal has the makings of a fine sedan. Asking prices could still make the Regal attractive for many people. Though the fully loaded Regal GS I test drove stickered for over $28,000, a red tag hanging from the mirror of a similarly equipped and priced 2000 gave the dealer�s asking price as twenty-one and change, well under �dealer invoice.� This is a lot of car for that amount of money. At $21,000, they�re practically giving this car away. But Olds dealers are also dealing, so I strongly suggest looking at an Intrigue before buying a Regal. You might not get quite as good of a deal with an Intrigue, but you�ll get a much better car.
