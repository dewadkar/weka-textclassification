            I saw my 1994 cougar XR-7 on the lot and I thought it was the best looking car that i could get. Not only was it beautiful, it had a 4.6 liter engine in it.  So it looked good, and it was fast.  So I bought it.  With the trade in, I got the car for $5,500.00, I thought I got a great deal.  Now it is 4 months later, and I have sunk $940.00 into it. 

  -brand new Mass Airflow Sensor  $330.00
  -brand new spark plug wires  $260.00
  -brand new Speed Sensor for rear axle  $50.00 (covered by extended      warrenty)
  -some odd ball electric problem $130.00
  
And now for some reason, the door drops down when you open it and it ripped 3 inches of the driver side, rear window trim off of the car.  It is also doing it on the passenger side, but not as bad.  It will cost me another $170.00 to fix that.

Other than the mechanical problems, it drives great, has great handling. fun to drive.  If you have the money took keep the 'Engine' light off, I suggest that you think about it long and hard.<br><br>
