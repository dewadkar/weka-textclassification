            I had the pleasure of borrowing my friend's Audi A4 1.8T for a trip from Andover, MA to Six Flags in NJ for a weekend.

<b>First Impression:</b>
When I first got into the driver's seat, I looked around me. The layout of the instrument panels was acceptable... things were in reach. I sat in the driver's seat for a bit more looking for cool things. One thing that intrigued me was that the moonroof controls were different. You do not slide the moonroof open, the moonroof cannot be open at continuous intervals. But rather, there is a dial there with i think 4 settings. I thought this was kinda stupid, but anyways, I tried to turn on the radio since i love music, and i found it hard to figure out. After a while, the radio was on and i was ready to drive.

<b>On the road:</b>
I began driving by flooring the car. For some reason I always do this, to get a sense of how powerful and fast the car is. I was disappointed. The RPMs went up slowly... I would think that for a pretty expensive car, it would be more powerful. But anyways, at low RPMs, the 1.8T is slow to accelerate... but... once I got up into the high end, the turbo started kicking in and you can feel the pull. But, let's admit it, most drivers do not floor the car everytime they accelerate, so the turbo seems useless. Aside from the lack of power from the 150HP engine, every else seems fine. The ride is firm, but smooth. The stability and noise level at 80MPH is comfortable. One good thing that I have to note is that the A/C is very very cold. Since it was the summer time with temperatures in the 90s, I was very happy with this.

<b>Overall:</b>
I can't say that the Audi is a bad car... but me being a power hungry person, I would not recommend this car... <b>UNLESS</b> you are planning on modifing the engine. I have heard that the 1.8T is a great base for modifications, with a single chip upping the HP from 150 to 190. Add headers and exhaust to this, and you're up into the range of 220 horses. Which is not bad... But, for all you non-enthusiasts, the Audi seems like a good car, though i have to complain about the $24000 price tag.. I would think that the BMW323i would be a better buy for about 2-3Grand more.
