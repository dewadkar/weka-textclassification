            When my wife and I began our extensive search to replace her 84 Buick, we knew we wanted an SUV because she has to travel a great distance to work.  We researched many models and finally narrowed it down to the Jeep.  Being on a budget, the Cherokee Sport fit nicely into our price range.  After owning the vehicle for just over a year, there are many positive aspect of the vehicle, but also a few major negative aspects.<br>Exterior:  (6)  The Jeep we purchased was Gun Metal Grey (a cross between blue and grey).  I love the color and initially, I loved the fact that the body style had not changed much over the years.  I now wish we were able to differentiate our Jeep from my father-in-laws 1991 Jeep, or my brothers 1988 Jeep.  The body style now seems old and outdated with the newer and flashier SUV's coming on the market.  I do like the five-spoke painted aluminum wheels and the large tires that came standard on the Jeep.<br><br>Interior: (5)   The cloth seats are very durable and easy to clean.  They are not that fuzzy velour texture, which helps when you are carrying dirty items.  All dashboard display items are easy to read and to reach.  Cup holders are adequate, but the center console, as well as the glove compartment storage are too small.  Head and leg room are ample and my friends have plenty of room in the back seat.  On the downside, the interior is very noisy.  When travelling over 50 miles per hour, you can hear the wind howl and the engine growl.  Jeep also made a huge mistake by placing the full-size spare in the trunk space.  It takes up almost one quarter of the room for storage in the back.  Spare tire should be stored under the vehicle, like the Explorers spare.  It may be slightly more cumbersome to retrieve it, but you hopefully won't need it that often.<br><br>Engine: (2)   Low on power and very noisy and rough.  When you accelerate hard, it feels and sounds like the engine is going to shoot out of the compartment.  When I have a large load (like a 1,000 pounds of rock), the engine struggles to get me going.<br><br>Ride: (7)  Like most other SUV's I test drove.  Rough, but if I wanted the ride of a Mercedes, I would have bought a Mercedes.<br><br>Handling:  (9)  It stops quite well and handles the snow and rain like it should.  We visited friends in Vermont and it carried us through some heavy snow and later, some sticky mud without skipping a beat.<br><br>Reliability:  (6)  Jury still out.  We have had one recall (airbag) and no matter how much we tighten the support for the spare tire, it still squeaks loudly.  No problems other than that.<br><br>Value:  (9)  Although we aren't selling the Jeep, all used Jeeps in our area seem to command a premium dollar.  For our purposes, it has held up well.  We aren't too rough on it, but I think it could handle it if we were.<br><br>Verdict:  Overall, I am only marginally pleased with the Jeep.  If it had more power, a smoother engine and interior and moved the spare to a better place, I would be happy.  But these are all big issues in my mind.<br><br><br>
