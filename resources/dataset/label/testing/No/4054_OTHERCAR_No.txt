              I received this camera as a gift.  I already own a Polaraid PDC-700, a nice, but fairly featureless camera.  
   What I LIKE about this camera are the features: zoom lens, dual compact flash cards, short video and time lapse photography, and the general feel, which is more like a camera than a lot of models.
   What I DISLIKE about the camera is (1) not having an AC adapter which is a $69 extra (say what!). (2) The unexplainable delay in the shutter when taking flash pictures.  It's like &quot;Click, nothing happens, I must not have turned it on, then FLASH!&quot;  This makes the camera almost unsuitable for anything but still life inside.  
    What I HATE about the camera is that I cannot get the software included for downloading the pictures to work.  After several attempts I called the Panasonic help line and was flicked off after a brief attempt to help me.  &quot;You should try it on another computer or call Microsoft.&quot; Now which of my dozen computers should I try next?  I am able to download using the included Adobe software, but since it wants to save the pictures in a proprietary format, it's a long and tedious process to &quot;export&quot; each picture to a more standard JPEG format. I will be getting a flash card downloader which hopefully will solve the problem.<br><br>
