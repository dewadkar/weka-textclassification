            I purchased a 98 Plymouth Voyager when my back was up against the wall.  My Dodge Caravan had broken down and the extended warranty would not cover it.  (That's another opinion I'll write as a warning as why not to buy that particular extended warranty.)  The price of a basic Voyager was between $17,000-$18,000.  I've hated it since the day I got it.  It is cheaply put together.  The right sun visor broke off after a year.  The interior looks really cheap.  You get no extra amenities (no cruise control, no dual air, no tinted windows, no power windows, no headrests).  The van is about as basic as you will find and is a 4 cylinder.  I will not ever purchase this van again (nor will I purchase a Dodge Caravan again).  For the same money (or maybe just a little more), you can get more for your money.  I'm going Monday (1/3/00) to look into purchasing a Ford Windstar.  Whether I buy the Ford Windstar or not, I'm getting rid of this Plymouth Voyager. <br><br>
