            I enjoy driving my 94 Cadillac DeVille Concours.  It has great seats that can't be beat on long driving trips.  I have the Northstar engine.  It has plenty of power, and is easy on gas.  The car has great styling.  It has one problem that keeps reoccurring however and it isn't cheap to repair.  That is that the ride control system keeps going out on it.  This has happened two times since I've owned the car.  Each time it's cost me aprox. $1,100. to repair.  The compressor that evens out the shocks when the load is uneven is the culprit.  It stops functioning and then the air lines to the shocks get condensation in them.  I hope Cadillac has fixed this problem on the newer models.  This is my second Cadillac.  My first was an '89 Eldorado.  I hope it won't be my last.<br><br>
