            The Kia Sportage is good on gas, but that is about all, my wife purchase that car brand new, and right now she is in the process of legal battle with Kia (lemon law), the electrical system had to be checked more than three times, the windows in the front, drivers and passengers side when attempting to close you can hear the pressure of the windows going up to much, it sounds like it is about to break, and every time we take the car to be service for that particular problem, they never have the part, and they can never see your car when you bring it in, you have to schedule for a week later.
 After having the car for a year my wife took herself and the boys to church and when she arrived  and started to park the car she couldn't turn the steering wheel, the power steering pump fail and the car had to be towed and fixed the next day. 
The engine light kept coming on and we took it to be serviced and their was nothing wrong with the engine. 
 On the steering wheel they have a place for you to use your horn, if you ever try to use it in an emergency situation you are in big trouble, it is hard to push and if you have to look to find it you will probably get into an accident that' how bad it is, they should have two button for the horn like on some vehicles, but there horns are under the the covering of the pad and it is marked, but it is sure hard to push. 
Trying to get to the fuse box is very awkward it is located on the drivers side under the dash in the left upper corner.
 There is no room in the back for normal size people the will fit but it is uncomfortable. The hatch is to small. 
I look at my wife's car as if it was the car the &quot;Flintstones&quot; was driving. Oh yeah, one more thing when the battery is disconnected or there is something wrong with the electrical system, boy do you have a time trying to get your radio set back up to play, you have to set the code and if you do not get it right after a couple of times you have to wait for an hour and try it again. 
You are better off staying away from this car unless you are going for gas mileage and do not mind taking aspirin and being stress out, i heard  this car was made by Hyundai.<br><br>
