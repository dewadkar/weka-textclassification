            First of all, I do not own a saturn.  My best friend owns this particular model, and I have another friend that owns a similar model, only a year older.      

Now when you think of Saturn, you think "No haggle pricing", "no rust plastic panels", right?

Well here are a few other things to consider.

These cars do not age well.  They quickly begin to ride a little rougher,  little noises begin to appear and grow louder with age.  Plastic interior pieces begin to crack, you begin going to the shop more and more, etc.  

My friend with this paricular model, with only 56,000 miles on it learned the hardway.  The engine gave out on a relativiely short trip from L.A. to San Francisco.  Prior to that, they've had reoccuring exhaust gasket problems, the clutch gave out at a young age, and a few other minor difficulties. 

Now my other accquaintance, of whom I've shared many-a-ride in his Saturn,  he's had much worse luck.  He's owned the car for 3 years.  Since then,  here is a list of the problems I am personally well aware of, and I swear this is a 100% accurate itemization.

1.  A malfunction wheel "hub" ( I believe this is what it was called) caused the right rear wheel to fall completely off the car while turning a corner at about 15 miles an hour.  We were coming home late at night, and while at first reaction it was a little funny, he was not amused.

2.   He has gone through 3 alternators.

3.   Although the plastic panels do not rust,  if you get into a minor fender bender, they may crack completely apart, leaving an unsightly hole in your Saturn, which is quite costly to repair.

4.    The interior.  Oh yes...the interior.  First of all, the passenger window (not equipped with p/windows) quickly became stripped, making it impossible to roll down the window.  This was closely followed by the driver side window, making it quite uncomfortable for summer driving, especially considering that the A/C is nearly useless.  The interior door panels began to come loose, slightly at first, then eventually almost shaking themselves off when you shut the doors.  

5.     Last but not least, the noise.  After about 50,000 miles, the car sounded like an old VW superbeetle.  Even with the regular maintenance, and plenty of trips to the shop (and not always voluntarily),  the car ran like a truck.  A truck very low to the ground, with very still suspension.


So these are just some things to consider, these are two people I've known very well for a long time, as well as their cars.  I'm sure these 2 cars may not reflect Saturn Automobiles as a hole, but these are 2 relatively new Saturns, that have both had chronic problems.
