            I currently own a 1993 Allante.  Previously, I owned a 1991 model.  During the past 6 years of Allante ownership there has been a love and hate relationship with the car.  I love the looks, the performance, the up to date computerization and the overall joy of driving this car.  What do I hate?  Well, the upper parts of the car were manufactured in Italy.  A big mistake.  Now that the car has been out of production for 6 years, parts for the body are becoming a problem to obtain.  Some are unavailable unless you can find a car being &quot;parted out&quot;.  This model should have been built in the United States.  The quality would have been better and the price would have been more affordable when new.  The drivetrain is probably the best around.  I would think that the person to purchase this car should want to keep it and be able to afford to repair it when necessary.<br><br>
