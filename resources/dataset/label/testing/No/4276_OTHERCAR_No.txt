            I started as a Volkswagen buyer with a red 2000 New Beetle GLS wth the 2.0 litre engine.  It was too slow.  Within 4 months, I caught wind of the limited editions that were coming out.  I was excited - I could actually have one of 2,000 cars made in the special limited edition reflex (mustardy yellow) color.

When March came around, I was online and ordering my Reflex Yellow 1.8 Turbo New Beetle.  Within a month, it was at my local dealership.  Whoa!  I was excited!  Took delivery of it and took the baby home.

I wish epinions.com was around back then.  I would have read up on the many many problems that Volkswagen STILL have.  Poor quality!

Seems as if the check engine light is common sight in Volkswagen.  (See my review on my Volkswagen GTI GLX)  Also, the air bag light is another common sight.  Repairs to these problems is a slow process, due to the large number of new buyers and no expansion of dealers' service areas.  Bottom line is - the Volkswagen dealers haven't prepared themselves for the surge in Volkswagen customers.  In some cities, you might have wait for up to 3 weeks for a 5,000 mile routine service appointment.

I like the New Beetle, but I'd never own another Volkswagen product.  I'd only own another one if their quality issues change.

For model year 2002 Volkswagen changed the warranty.  The basic warranty is upped from 2 years/24,000 miles to 3 year/36,000 miles.  BUT - free oil changes, etc. are all dropped!  Also, the power train warranty is lowered from 10 years/100,000 miles to half of that to 5 years/50,000 miles.  One good thing, roadside assistance runs alongside the basic warranty... that'll be good when your VW breaks down on the side of the road.

<b>First problem:  Reflex Beetle's driver side window.</b>
The driver's side window starting acting odd.  It wouldn't roll up all the way by itself.  I needed to push the button up and down repeatedly.  Sometimes it took three or four tries to fix it.  When I brought this matter into the car dealer, they were unable to find a problem.  No good!

<b>Second problem:  Reflex Beetle's air bag light comes on.</b>
When this light comes on, it means that the airbag is not going to work properly in the event of a crash.  The dealership and Volkswagen of America didn't care much about this situation.  The dealer replaced the driver's side air bag, but the light came back on within a few days.  The light would sometimes constantly stay on, other times it would flash like a wild animal.  The car was off the road in the shop for a total of 25 days waiting for the proper parts.  Bottom line:  this isn't as safe a car as Volkswagen claims - many publications have talked about the New Beetle's problems.  It was also listed as a used car to avoid in 1998.

<b>Third problem:  Check engine light came on over 7 times.</b>
Yes, it was annoying.  These problems kept the car off the road at the dealership for over 60 days total.  The problem was with the emissions system, transmission, and the catalytic converter.  I was wondering to myself, how can the transmission cause the check engine light to come on?  Sound crazy?  it was.  The light and problem would be fixed at the dealership, and within 40 or 50 miles the light would come back on.  I was on a first name basis with the service manager and the other staff at the dealership.  I opened a case with the Better Business Bureau's Auto Line.  I also tried to find remedy with Volkswagen.

Volkswagen sent me a reply stating that the car was not a lemon and it was acting within the manufacturer's guidelines.  Bull!  In almost all states, if a car spends more than 30 days off the road for service related issues - it is a certified lemon.

<b>Fourth problem:  Electrical short in the middle of nowhere.</b>
I was driving home around midnight one night when all of a sudden the car lost all power.  I was able to use the remaining brake power and steer to the side of Interstate 81.  I tried to start the car again, and it was completely dead.  The only thing that was working on the car were the hazard lights.  Lucky, huh!  Roadside assistance from Volkswagen was going to take the typical 60-120 minutes.  No way!  This was a dangerous situation.  Nobody knows what happened.

<b>Fifth problem:  New Beetles seems to be thirsty for oil and coolant.</b>
I was alerted to a red light flashing on my panel on both cars.  Seems as if the engines was overheating!  I pulled off the road and popped the hood to take a peek.  Nothing seemed to be burning.  When taking it back to the dealership they told me that the coolant level was extremely low.  Seems strange on a car with 6,770 miles - and 5,000 service was performed just a month ago.  How could this small car drink so much coolant in such a small period of time?

Oil levels were always going down down down!  I found it to be odd!  I took it back to the dealership, and they filled the oil and asked me to bring the car back next week.  The next week, it needed more oil.  Odd.

In the end, Volkswagen was forced to buy the car back from me by the BBB.  After over 70 trips to the dealer's service department... I was very happy!

So long, no more Volkswagen for me.
