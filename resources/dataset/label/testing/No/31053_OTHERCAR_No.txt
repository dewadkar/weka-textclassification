            I have 95,000 miles on it and bought it in 1994. Overall it has been a pretty good car. My biggest problem was when the engine suddenly quit while driving and wouldn't start. After toubleshooting it myself for 3 weeks I gave up and took it to the dealer. It needed an electronic control module/ECM (computer)which cost me $1288.00 for the part, and $1550.99 total. I could have done the work myself if the onboard diagnostics would have revealed the problem. When I counted the flashes on the dashboard it gave a code 12 which means no problems. 
The engine trouble light comes on automatically at 50k and again at 80k miles. It can be reset by flipping a tiny switch which is very well hidden. It forces you to take it to the garage and shell out some bucks for something stupid. 
The ride is a little choppy but OK for short trips.
It is dangerous when you hit bumps on the freeway. The short wheel base makes it unstable and subject to spinouts, especially on slick roads. The 4 door models with the longer wheelbase would be safer. 
Don't try to resurface the brake rotors. They need an adapter that most garages don't have. Just get new rotors.
Besides, the new ones will make it easy to see how to get the old ones off the spindle.
The 1.6 liter engine is adequate as long as it is running good. I would recommend something a little bigger. 
The 4WD is nice but you can still get stuck if you get one wheel spinning in the front and one wheel spinning in the back.
The doors often get frozen shut in the winter.
I like the reclining seats, the inside adjustable rearview mirrors, and the rear window defoggers. The air conditioner has been trouble free.
On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this car a 4.
