            We pretty much gave away our 1992 Grand Caravan LE last year. When we bought it we were looking for a comfortable and stable van for our family of five. After years of buying basic transportation this was the first fully loaded vehicle we had ever bought and we were thrilled but our enthusiasm took a hit early on when the sliding door fell off in the driveway during the first month of use.

 Things went from bad to worse when the engine threw a rod at 17,000 mi while driving at 60 mph on I80. Fortunately, no one was hurt but the engine was a total loss and had to be replaced. 

 Numerous inconvenient problems followed: the starter (3 times!), alternator, EFI computer panel and transmission all had to be replaced before 80,000 miles. The van had a particularly annoying tendency to fail during trips out of town. It would either overheat, wouldn't start or for variety the battery would blow up (twice).

 After 7 yrs of this we decided enough was enough and sold the lemon but prior to doing so it had one last surprise for us. Ever since we could remember the power brakes would make a  loud humming sound when engaged (the Dodge service department assured us this was not a concern). Frequently the &quot;check anti-lock brakes&quot; light would come on but the shop could never find the cause.  One day the anti-lock brakes motor failed completely while trying to stop on a hill and a serious accident was narrowly averted. When the motor was replaced the hum disappeared--just in time for the van to be sold. At that point we were beyond caring.

 In summary, these vans are great for hauling kids and gear but avoid them like the plague or the repair costs will send you to the poorhouse. Resale valuation is quite low on these vans and for good reason. You may think you are getting a great deal but think again.<br><br>
