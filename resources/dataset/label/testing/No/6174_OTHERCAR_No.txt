            The Venture handles great.  We get over 400 miles on a tank of gas.  It is roomy and comfortable.  I especially liked the body style.  I also like that it has front and rear heat and AC controls.  We have had a few problems though.  We have had to put the Venture in the shop a total of 7 times.  The electric sliding door stopped working 3 times.  One of those times the door refused to close.  We have had the transmission replaced and a pop in the front end.  For some reason the back tire is wearing out and we have checked out the alignment and the tire itself.  Nothing is wrong with either of them.  Everything is fixed at the moment but I worry sometimes when I am driving down the road if the door is going to malfunction again.<br><br>
