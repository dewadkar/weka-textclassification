            I'm sure my mentality will cause a bit of an uproar, and if you are in love with this car, please don't take offense to my review.  Being the USA's best seller, I expect most people to disagree with what I am about to say.  I test drove the 4cyl version and my wife's friend let me drive her V6; here are my thoughts.

=======================

<b>Intro:</b>

The Accord may not be the best at anything but it's better at everything than any other car in it's segment.  This pretty accurately describes how I feel about the car.  <i>How then can I not recommend such a great car?</i>

Well, honestly, it comes down to this: I don't know who I would recommend this car to.  Everyone has a different 'style' about them- which one fits the Accord?

My wife likes a cushioned, quiet ride, luxury, a good stereo, and reliability.  My old roommate and good friend likes what he calls 'schwoop'- the ability of a car to press you to the back of the seat with a tap of the gas pedal.  I like nimble cars that can be tossed around corners on a whim, and ask for more.

We're three completely different types of buyers at different ends of the spectrum.  Would the Accord make each of us happy?  Certainly!  However, there are better choices for each of us.  How can this be?

<b>The luxurious driver:</b> For my wife, who likes a cushioned, luxurious, and quiet ride, the Accord would deliver.  However, for this type of ride, the Camry suits her even better.  The ride is more isolated, the trunk is much larger, the car is quieter, and the Camry's stock stereo is better than most aftermarket ones.  While the Accord's 4cyl engine is torquey, the Camry's is torquier, making it even more pleasant around town.  Cosmetically, the interiors of both cars are very similar, and reliability and resale are equally stellar.  Personally, I don't like the Camry much at all, but she absolutely loves it- more than the Accord.  So for my wife, I could not recommend the Accord.  The Camry, with its larger interior and trunk, is probably best suited for families.

<b>The fast driver:</b> For my old roommate and good friend, who likes fast, practical cars, the Accord would deliver.  The Accord has two incredible engines to choose from, though unfortunately the V6 sedan isn't available in a manual transmission.  However, for style and brute power, the Altima bests the Accord.  While I'm personally not a huge fan of the Altima and would argue the Accord is a better overall car, I know it wouldn't please him the way the Altima can (and does).  Consequently, he's shopped both and likes the Altima.  So for my friend, I could not recommend the Accord.

<b>The sporty driver:</b> For me, I like a sporty, nimble sedan.  Is the Accord sporty or nimble?  Some may think so; I certainly do not.  While it is admittantly better than most midsize cars, I still found the handling mushy, particularly with the V6- the car simply felt <i>big</i>.  For me, there's the Mazda6 (<a href="/content_88812588676">review</a>).  The Mazda6 is a much more tossable car, has a sportier look inside and out, a roomier trunk, and a surprisingly more comfortable highway ride (likely due to the stiffer chassis).  It suites me perfectly.  Would I like the Accord?  Sure, but I love my Mazda6.


<b>A car for who?</b>

Does anyone really compromise on everything?

Honestly, it's not that I have anything bad to say for the Accord- it's just that I don't know who I'd recommend the car to.  For any given driving style, I think there is a better choice out there.

I'll repeat again a common phrase that seems to sum up the Accord, <i>"The Accord may not be the best at anything but it's better at everything than any other car in it's segment."</i>

If Accord is best at nothing, than how can it be best at what you enjoy?  Every car has a balance- and with the Accord all scales are weighted equally well.  In other cars, we see a clear bias in design from its strengths and weaknesses.  While this makes the Accord universally appealing (hence an award winner, best seller), who can I recommend it to?

In the examples I gave, these people have passions or preferences.  Loving the Camry's soft ride allow my wife to overlook mediocre handling.  The pro of the car far outweights the con, and on nearly all other turf the cars are equal.  Likewise, my old friend certainly isn't thinking about the Altima's mediocre interior when stomping the gas.  The functionality is the same- it still seats five with a huge trunk.  I don't wish for more low-end torque in my '6 while I'm whipping around turns.  Actually, I love its peaky nature.

<b>Lose Yourself:</b>

I honestly think the Accord is the best overall car in its segment, but it is not a better overall car to me.  Nor, for that matter, the others I illustrated in the review.  All these people and I would (or did) find the Accord great, but- to us- another car even better.  For those of you who just want a little bit of everything, there's the Accord.  One-size-fits-all.

Here's an analogy: While the car might look good in an unoffending beige or black, is that your favorite color?

Don't have one?  Get the Accord.  Perhaps also families with more than one driver could compromise on the Accord.  If my wife, friend, and self had to share a car- the Accord would be it.  Hey, since the car offends no one, resale value is sure to stay high, right?

In the end, <b>test drive every car you can</b>, and buy the one that ends with the biggest grin.
