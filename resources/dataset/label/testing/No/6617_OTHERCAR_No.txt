            My car and I seem to have a love-hate relationship... things are bliss or absolute torture.  For instance, the absolute joy of lowering the top and seeing the poetic dance of the automatic stowage and hard tonneau cover, then the very next time the top is lowered an absolute fight with SID (Saab Information display) that will yell at me, chime and refuse to lower... Check trunk... OK, top storage WAS lowered...*Chime* Check Latches... Duh!  The latches are both released... *Chime* Check Latches... those are the days that she doesn't want to expose herself to the elements I suppose.  There are quite a few of these little "quirks" that she exhibits- usually at the worst of times.

Having owned for a year at this point, for a wile EVERY, and yes, I mean EVERY long weekend, something incapacitating would happen... you know, like labour day when it just refused to start, fourth of July when a hose blew, excreting gallons of antifreeze all over the parking lot at work, memorial day when the serpentine belt gave out (having been checked when it was serviced for the FoJ incident), Thanksgiving and the alternator goes...  I finally just decided to have the 50,000 mile exorcism completed and gremlin bashing with an extended warranty.

So far, no problems (I think the car knows...)  Having seemingly squashed all of the bugs, the car really does have some wonderful attributes.  Top up or down, the car is still gorgeous and people don't seem to have a problem telling me that!  Young and old, male and female- from a bus load of cheerleaders at a traffic light screaming in unison "Cool Car!", a flock of kids on bikes circling me and asking a million questions about it and an elderly lady who strolled up to me at a gas station in the bitter cold and also had a million questions and asked for the grand tour of the car...  Ego aside, the car still feels solid and I feel safe, even when surrounded by towering SUVs and trucks.  The convertible truly is an all-weather car.  It pulls and tracks true threw the nastiest of snow (with 16" Gislavd tires) and the insulated top keeps the chill off and noise down.  The glass heated rear glass sheds fog, snow and ice in moments.  The heated leather seats are a definate boon in the colder months or when you just refuse to put the top up and temperatures drop.

The automatic climate control system is a bit tricky and confusing at first, insisting on automatically coming on everytime that the car is started.  The ride is definately "sporty" as a few minutes at pot hole plagued highway speeds will let your kidneys know.

The space utilization for a convertible is exemplary- it can hold 4 "real sized" adults in comfort and the back seat can fold down when the back seat is not being used with an opening @2'x3'.  Yes Virginia, you CAN fit a 6' beam of wood in the Saab Convertible and still have the top down! (This excited me like you would not believe last summer at Home Depot...)
What I like- all weather drivability, solidity, feeling of class in the interior, space, console mounted ignition, standard amenities and yes the attention (duh!)

What I could do without- reliability issues, cheesy "cupholder" in console- door mounted cup holders (offered by SAAB as European dealer accessory) are fine... until you slam the door, flooding footwell with a can of coke, Persistant "big brother" climate control, bossy SID and his even more annoying HUGE exclamation point of impending death brother appearing at the center of speedo for the smallest thing. 
All of this being said, considering the "competition"- Volvo, BMW, Mercedes, and to a slightly lesser degree, the Chrysler Sebring, there is no better all around convertible.
