            I got this camera because I was interested in digital photography, it was inexpensive and it was on sale.  It seemed to have some nice features:  high and low resolution selection, 8 second AVI movie capture, a USB cable, self timer and auto off.  Interestingly, it has no built-in flash, no camera strap nor anything to attach one onto.  The unit is small, plastic and easy to drop because of its smooth plastic outer case and no strap.

 I did some research on the net, read a number of reviews, and it seemed to be a reasonably decent camera for the price, so I went ahead and got it.  I knew it was a relatively cheap camera and that I shouldn't expect too much from it, but I figured I should at least expect to get decent outdoor pictures.

For an "owner manual," it had a one-page pamphlet.  The instructions are printed in several languages, so the instructions in English are only about three or four paragraphs.  It mentioned an "on" switch, which I couldn't find!  I had to write to tech support to find out that the "on" switch had been discontinued in the newer model and you have to press "mode" to turn it on.

I have taken pictures with this camera under a variety of circumstances and have yet to find the circumstances under which it takes other than a fuzzy, overexposed picture.  I've taken indoor shots with bright lighting, indoor shots with lots of natural light near a window, outdoor shots on an overcast day, outdoor shots in the shade and sun.  I've taken shots from 3 feet away from the subject up to 50 feet.  Each and every time, the resolution is lousy and the shots are not sharp, and I've only used the high resolution setting!  I've had a Canon SLR for years and have won awards as a serious amateur photographer, so it's not as if I don't know what I'm doing.

I'll probably pay more in shipping to send it back and see if it can be repaired than what I paid for the camera in the first place, and I'm pretty sure it won't be worth the hassle.
