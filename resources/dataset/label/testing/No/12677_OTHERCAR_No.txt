            I bought my 1997 Cavalier when it was new. Of course, I bought it because of the low price, and my old car was a Cavalier, with no problems.

Not that this car has had any mechanical problems, but it has had its share of problems. 

First thing that goes wrong. I get into an accident. What would have been little damage, was major. I was hit at a low speed of about 20 miles an hour. It was $3000 in damage. Looked like someone opened it with a can opener. Horrible. 

Second thing, the entire electrical system malfunctions. The dealership has if for 3 weeks trying to figure out what happened. Turns out, there is an electrical problem, they have to recall all 1996 and 1997s.

A little time goes by, no problems. Then the airbag recall.
Seems that airbags are going off for no reason. Need to fix that!

A few months later some idiot decides they want to steal the radio, then try to take it for a joy ride. Why somebody would want to steal a strip model 5 speed Cavalier is beyond me. Turns out, the moron can't drive a stick, and rolls it to the bottom of my street. Back to the body shop!
Another couple thousand in damages. The body shop then calls me at work to tell me that my airbags were never fixed with the recall. Go figure! What did the dealer do with my car for 2 days?

Anyways, after seeing all that happen to my car, I can see why people call them death traps! You could get killed in that thing!!

During a winter storm, mind you, it is horrible in snow and ice, the windshield wipers break. I mean, they still work, just backwards. They stay up when they are off, and during delay. No one can seem to figure that one out. Its still not fixed!! 

It is also a rattle box. 

The good thing I have to say about the car, is that it gets you where you need to go, the clutch is still going strong, it has great gas mileage, and there have been no major mechanical problems. 

I am now looking to trade it in. I feel bad for the next person to purchase it.
