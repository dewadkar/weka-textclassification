            I got my car in August of 2002 after someone hit me and totaled my 2001 Cavalier.  I was looking at new cars, when I decided to get a nice, used car.  I was so excited that I got a Dodge Avenger, because they were very sporty.  Well, my step dad and I test drove the car and it made a terrible jerk when the car was shifted from reverse to drive and when the car shifted between certain gears.  The dealership agreed to fix the car and we could bring it back guaranteed if it acted up again, so we agreed.  Approximately a few weeks after I got the car, I noticed that there was a very thick black gooey substance on the door panels underneath the actual door.  I went to auto zone and asked them about this and they said they had never heard such a thing.  So I proceeded to buy a product called Goo-Gone.  I tried soooo hard to scrub this stuff off, but it wouldn't come off and also it was harsh enough that it caused parts of the door panel where I scrubbed to fade.  I then proceeded to go back to the dealership and they gave me a run around telling me they would have to take off both of my doors take a look at it, let me know what it was and then bring my car back again and leave it with them for a few days, without a rental car of any kind.  By this time I was somewhat frustrated being that I'm a 20 year old student that also works full time.  I've read other reviews on this site that talked about the same problem, so I'm wondering if it is something we could all write dodge about and have them reimburse us for our time and inconvenience.
The second problem I think most avenger owners would agree on is the placement of the radio.  You have to maneuver your hand around the shifter to get to your preset stations, and if you have anything plugged into the lighter socket, you have to maneuver around that as well.  Also, the steering wheel doesn't raise very high, so if you are tall, you may have a problem getting situated in the car, or even getting in and out of it without smacking your knees against it every time, like my boyfriend does.
Also, the power is very limited for a sports car.  I feel like my mom's escort has more potential.  
There is only 1 real cup holder in the car and that doesn't help very much if you fill the car with 4 extra passengers.
The center counsel is in a not so great place either, you have to bend your arm all the way back to get it to open fully.
All in all, my car gets me where I'm going, but it isn't exactly what I expected.  I think that it has tons of potential but it just should have been mapped out much better.
