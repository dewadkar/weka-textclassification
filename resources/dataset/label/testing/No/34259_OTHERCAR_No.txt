            ABOUT THE REVIEWER: Just so you'll know the reference point from which I write ... I live in the Southwest, I drive to/from work weekdays (about 20 miles; 75% highway, 25% city). Previous luxury sedans I've owned include a 1993 Lexus ES-300 and a 1997 Mercedes E-320. 

I also travel for work, so I RENT cars frequently. Most years, I rent about 30 different vehicles all over the U.S., mostly from Hertz. As such, over the years I've driven thousands of miles in current, low-mileage models of Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable, Toyota Camry, Volvo S60 and S80, Lincoln LS, Ford Explorer, Ford Windstar, Ford Expedition, and fewer miles in many others including other Jaguars.

I've put just over 23,000 miles on my Jaguar X-Type in 23 months.


<b>THE WHOLE SAD STORY ...</b>
Two years ago (December '01) I was looking for a new car. Narrowed my choices down to the BMW 330i, the Mercedes C-Class, and the Jag X-Type. The X was new (but with a 2-year track record in England), beautiful, sexy and stylish, etc. I was hooked ... I ordered one from the factory.

I took delivery on January 2, 2002.  In the first seven months I owned the car, it spent SEVEN WEEKS in the repair shop. No kidding, no exaggeration. 

Part of the problem was the constant failures of major systems (the GAS TANK broke loose on one side!); the other problem was the near-unavailability of replacement parts in the US. EVERYTHING, from a new speedometer to a gas tank, had to come from England, usually with a 1.5-to-2-week shipping delay.

Meanwhile, during repair delays, I'm driving a service loaner car (a Dodge Stratus or similar; not a bad car but not exactly what I'm paying for).

Yes, Jaguar has covered most all of the work under the Warranty, but I'll never get back the 10 weeks of downtime that I didn't get to drive my car.

<b>Can't I Get a Different One?</b> It's clear that this car (mine, at least) is a lemon. It's plagued by problems from stem to stern. But Jaguar won't replace the vehicle. I begged, pleaded, threatened, held my breath 'til my face turned blue ...

I can't sue under my state's "Lemon Law" because (a) It's always a different problem, so I don't meet the "repeated attempts to fix the same problem" test; and (b) They provide me with a set of wheels to drive, so I'm not "deprived of transportation" as required under the statutes.

<b>What Exactly Went Wrong?</b> Here is a PARTIAL list of major system repairs that this upscale luxury/sports car has needed since delivery:
REPLACE GAS TANK
REPLACE TRANSMISSION
REPLACE STEERING RACK
REPLACE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER
REPLACE CRUISE CONTROL
REPLACE TRUNK LID LATCH
REPLACE WINDSHIELD WASHER SYSTEM
REPLACE SUN ROOF FRAME
... More to Come, certainly ...

<b>Unsupported Technology.</b> When I got the car, the navigational data in the GPS system was a year old. It took Jaguar another 14 months to get an update issued, by which time the GPS was essentially useless (2-year-old data means wrong turns, wrong exits, missing addresses, etc.) The dealer has tried to help, but they're equally frustrated. The General Manager of the dealership says it best: "How can they expect to offer technology that they don't support?"


<b>ABOUT THE CAR</b>
At the suggestion of some (trusted) reviewers here on Epinions, I'm offering a bit more detail about the car itself: its features, function, comfort, performance, etc. Obviously, my biggest problem with the car has been related to the outrageous failure rate and the repairs necessitated by same. For this section, however, I'll try to be as objective as I can about the car's OTHER characteristics.

<b>Comfort.</b> The X-Type is a small, sporty sedan with a luxury pedigree. But as it's designed to sell at a price point in the upper-thirties (without many options, that is), its interior is merely comfy, if not opulent.

Interior appointments are upscale, especially if you order the GPS Nav system (as I did) because all major systems (audio, climate, nav, and phone) are controlled from the touchscreen. Power everything, nice wood trim on the dash and doors, etc.

The climate control is capable even in hot Texas summers (but it's slow; see "bad things" below). The audio system (the "high-end" upgraded model with subwoofer) is OK, but the sound quality is only fair, not wonderful. 

The analog instruments are easy to read. The cruise control holds selected speeds very well.

GOOD THINGS: (1) A tiny amber-colored lamp overhead (near the reading lights) bathes the front seat area with a very subtle light during night driving. It's a great help when you need to glance down for something. (2) All four power windows are auto-up and auto-down. Very convenient. (3) The auto-sensing rear-view mirror works well. (4) Wheel-mounted controls (for audio system and cruise control) are well-designed and VERY handy.

BAD THINGS: (1) Only ONE cup holder! Aaaargh! Have car makers selling to Americans learned NOTHING? I have a place for my beverage; not so my passengers. (2) Maddening time lag in climate control: When starting the car, it takes a full 30 seconds (really) for the air conditioner to switch on ... which is BRUTAL when climbing into a hot car on a 100-degree day. When you make a temperature change on the climate control, it takes nearly as long for the unit to respond to the new setting. Once it catches up to you, however, it holds the chosen temp very well.

<b>Seating.</b> In general, the leather upholstery is well-made, although the beige leather has an annoying tendency to darken (and stay soiled) just from contact with occupant clothing. Same for the center arm rest and door panels. I've owned other tan-leather-interior cars with no such problems (Lexus ES-300, for one). I think it's a problem with the dye or surface finish of the leather itself. I've used many different types of leather cleaner on the seats and they still look dingy and soiled.

Seat padding and lumbar support are fine for drives lasting up to 3 hours. Longer than that, you need supplemental padding (on the seat, or on your person) to avoid discomfort.

The passenger compartment is small for a four-door sedan, particularly left-to-right. It's close quarters for two large adults.  Front seat legroom and headroom are fine for passengers up to 6 feet tall and/or persons of average build/weight. Taller (or heavier) people will be squeezed from top-to-bottom and/or side-to-side. I am a 5'10" male of average build, so I fit very comfortably when driving alone. If I have an adult passenger in the front seat, we usually rub elbows.

The back seat is too small for adults, except for very short trips. (Legroom is nonexistent, headroom is tight). Forget about 3 adults in back, unless they are VERY close friends.

<b>Noise.</b> Sound insulation is average, at best. On the highway, wind and road noise are downright annoying (not leaks, mind you, just noise through the windows and doors). I tried using a hands-free "car kit" with my cell phone; the background noise is such that callers couldn't hear me. I finally had to buy a special noise-canceling hands-free headset for driving.

<b>Ride, Handling.</b> The ride is fine, a pretty good compromise between sportiness and smoothness. Handling is very nice; I feel well in touch with the road but it's not too stiff or bumpy. This is due, in no small part, to the all-wheel-drive design. 

The car does not feel terribly sporty during aggressive cornering (which is pretty rare for me); it seems to want to float out of a curve if I'm not very careful. Not dangerous, but not a real road-grabber either.

Wet/slick road handling is very good. I learned to drive in snowy/icy weather and I appreciate the all-wheel drive in such conditions. (In this part of Texas we have lots of rainy/slick weather, not much ice or snow.)

<b>Performance.</b> The 2.5 (liter) X-Type is woefully underpowered. I occasionally drive the 3.0 model (as a rental) and it's better. Acceleration from a stop is something you really have to work at, even when you depress the accelerator all the way to the "kickdown" position.

At constant speeds, the car handles fine and can accelerate quickly to pass or change lanes.

<b>Fuel Economy.</b> Poor. My usual commute is 15 miles highway, 5 miles city, twice per day. Even at 75% highway driving (at about 60-65 mph, not too aggressive) I rarely get more than 20 mpg. On long highway trips I can sometimes see 21.5 mpg.

<b>Joy of Driving?</b> A bottom-line consideration for me, with any car (and certainly in the luxury car world) is: "Do I enjoy seeing my car in the driveway, climbing in and starting it, and driving it around?" On those counts, I would have to admit that this car is lovely to look at, it attracts very positive comments from passersby, and when driving at slow speeds on a pretty day, it's nice to have and ride in. 

Unfortunately, the entire ownership experience has been so marred by constant (MAJOR) mechanical failures that those fleeting moments of driving happiness are more than outweighed by the ever-present fear of the next breakdown and resentment at Jaguar for failing to take back or replace the car when it is so clearly a lemon.

<b>WOULD I BUY ANOTHER?</b>
Not on your life.  Without question this has been the worst vehicle ownership experience of my life. I will never, ever consider buying another Jaguar.
