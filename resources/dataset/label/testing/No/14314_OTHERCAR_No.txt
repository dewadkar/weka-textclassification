            This update is being printed at 14,000 miles.  I am still very disappointed in this car. With a 1.8 and a little over 130 horsepower you can't expect too much, but my problems have more to do with quality at this point than anything.  After 8 months of ownership my husband went to put the mirror up on the passenger side visor.  It broke off in his hand.  He did not use any access force.  The dealership refused to fix this saying he must have lifted it too hard.  My bumper is sagging now and they tell me someone backed into me.  I have checked out other Sentra's out there and they seem to have a similar problem.  If it is true that a we all got hit in the rear, maybe it's a reflection that the car is a piece of crap if the bumper is falling off under a 3 MPH impact.

The car is sluggish at all speeds, and I'm still think there is a problem with the car shifting gears.  The dealerships are the pits.  They refuse to fix anything and tell me there are no problems.  When I took my car to finally get the airbag module replaced so it would sit on the dash they scratched the hell out of my dashboard.  They are going to fix it, but give me a break.  The airbag is still not flush on the dash.  Getting an appointment took almost 4 days, this is something I almost had to go to Nissan corporate on.

I am not happy with this car.  I would now completely advise against it. Although you get more features for the money, the quality of a Toyota, Honda are worth paying extra for.

The Nissan Sentra GXE- automatic is the first car I have ever owned.  As a late-bloomer to the driving world (started when I was 24) I wanted to get something reliable, safe and affordable.  A family member had a very bad experience with a Civic going up at 50,000 miles so I wasn't about to try that.  The doors of the Corolla did not feel real strong to me (yes, an odd thing to look at when buying a car, but to me it's a safety thing).  The Corolla was also a little more money than I wanted to spend and the price for options got outrageous.  I looked into the Mazda Protege and again the doors felt chinsy and I rode in an earlier model and wasn't impressed.  My boyfriend at the time owned a 97' Sentra GXE and really didn't have any problems with it.  I decided on a 2002 Sentra GXE with ABS.  I also ended up getting mudguards, microfilter and floor mats.

For all the options in the car, I got it for a good price.  I paid, on the road- $15,800 for a car with all power, ABS and keyless entry.  I wouldn't have gotten half those options if I stuck with the Toyota or Honda, but almost wish I had just sucked it up.

Pros: The power mirrors are a great feature and I like the two compartments (one on the dash, one in the middle of the 2 front bucket seats).  The cup holders are great and even fit king size soda's. The drivers seat sits high which makes me feel safer in the car and the adjustments and tilt wheel are great features.  The keyless entry is just the best feature out there. Especially since the range is so good (can open the car from our apartment balcony). The truck open feature on the keyless entry is a lifesaver. The trunk is roomy and I've had no problems storing large luggage.  The fold-down seats have also come in handy a few times. The interior lights up quite nicely at night and the headlamps are very powerful.  

Cons: The steering of my Sentra has lost its rigidity. At high speeds this is very noticeable, especially in windy conditions or while being passed by trucks.  You feel like you have no control over the car.  The passenger seat is not comfortable.  I didn't expect much, considering our old Sentra had issues in this department as well. Really needs an upgrade. The knobs in the interior are extremely cheap and really should be improved.  

My Sentra has some problems shifting (automatically) at times, as the RPM's go way up and then back down. Wonder if this is just with my car?  The suspension is not great.  There is way too much road noise in this car, even at low speeds.  When the AC is on, forget about going slightly fast. I've had to floor it and turn the AC off just to maintain the speed of the highway of 65 (we refer to the AC switch as the turbo switch and turn it off-engage it, when merging on the highway). Our last Nissan had this problem. Nissan really needs to improve upon that. It takes away so much performance of the car in the summertime.

My other two main complaints are that the windshield wipers do not go over far enough. There is a good 4" on the drivers side window that isn't getting wiped.  When I talked to the dealer about this, they said they've heard this complaint from other people. The other issue is the sun visors.  They just are not nearly big enough. I know it is a smaller car, but come on! They don't even come close to covering your whole drivers side window. You have to use your hand to block out the sun. I'm sure it would cost them all of $2.00 to improve this feature.  This is a minor thing but even today I would have had a much safer and happier commute if I didn't have to use my hand to block out the sun.  If they can't spend the money to improve this, they should at least put some kind of tint on the car.  

Overall, the car is a good value for the money, but only if you are looking a ride that is really low on thrills and power.  You get the power windows and doors, but you sacrifice pickup and speed.  I think Nissan needs to work on some issues still to make this more of a competitor with Honda and Toyota.   I wish Nissan would have put more money into this car instead of focusing so much on the Altima.  Sentra's have really just gone down in quality over the last few years.
