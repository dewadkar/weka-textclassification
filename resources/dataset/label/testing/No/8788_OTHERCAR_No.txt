            We bought our 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan because of all the room it had for passengers and cargo.  The roomy interior gives us lots of room to carry things from the hardware store. Also, the van has a wonderful looking exterior.
 
The Caravan is a good car to drive, but the front end gets out of alignment easily.  This causes the front end to vibrate at certain speeds on the highway.

We had lots of trouble with the van from the very beginning.  Something was wrong with the car that made the engine cut off for a few seconds as we drove.  We had it into the shop six times for this problem.  It was an electronic problem.  Amazingly enough, on the sixth try, they finally fixed it.  We were due to get a new car due to the lemon law in our state.

Since the problem had something to do with the transmission, we are fairly certain that they caused our transmission seal to leak.  We just add transmission fluid every once in a while.   It's cheaper than fixing it or proving that they caused the problem.

The fan motor went out at a little over three years.  Eventually the air conditioner quit working, probably due to the work on the fan motor.  The air conditioning unit smelled like vinegar when it first came on.  

So, for all the money we paid for this van,  I wouldn't recommend it.  I would look for a van with a better repair record.  We have a Ford Escort about the same age as this van and it has never been in the shop for repairs.  I don't think any new vehicle should need repairs for the first three or four years.  <br><br>
