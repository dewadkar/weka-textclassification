              This car was bought in late 1996 from auction for my wife, to be driven daily to work. The car looked very nice and had about 45K on it, supposedly. It was one of our favorite choices due to reasonable price, good safety reputation, seating for 6, and relatively good reliability record, according to Consumer Reports magazine. Fortunately, after keeping it for 16 months and about 25K or so miles, could not tell you much about safety. But in most other respects, this car failed miserably.
  Despite big overall dimensions (practically full size), it is not proportionally big inside. You can put 6 people in, but most of them will not be happy after a while. Seats are too soft, with little back support and no side support whatsoever. Front middle position is sized for kids, but not safe for anybody - only lap belt is there and no headrest. Front headrests are too far back and too small. Rear seat cushion is way too short, soft and low. Our experience is that no average+ size adult would be able to spend there more than an hour without some back or/and leg pain as a result.
  Ride is too soft. Smooth, long irregularities on the freeway, which you may not even notice in better car, make this one float like a small boat in a storm. Even on smooth pavement, the body is always in motion. Tight turns make tires squeal even at low speeds, and overall handling is very unexciting. Engine sounds strong, but the car is not as fast as it sounds, adequate at best.
  Reliability? Wrong word here... During 16 months, it suffered from dead accumulator, alternator, rear shock absorbers, water pump, intermittent electrical ghosts in various equipment, blown small gaskets in cooling system, and, finally, blown head gasket and warped cylinder head. Sounds like too much? That's what I think. My wife got stranded in this car few times, including one on unlighted narrow stretch of a heavily traveled road, with dead alternator/battery (no lights) and no phone on hand. I think she still hates this car.
  By the way, cooling system problems seem to be not just isolated incident. Our friends had 2 Luminas at the time. One was '92 and another '93 3.1 Euro - same as ours. Both of them suffered from blown gaskets and cracked heads in a quite short period of time! Why? The way the engine cooling system in this car is designed, in my opinion, is invitation to a trouble. Top of the radiator is situated LOWER than the cylinder heads. Thus, if any air/vapor enters the system, most probably it will go not to the radiator (where it should go), but to the cylinder heads - causing them to overheat and, possibly, to crack.  I only can explain this design by GMï¿½s desire to save money. Not putting enough into more thorough design work and creation of better powerplant sure had saved them millions of $$ - and we had paid for some of that. One thing I should have checked was to find out if there were any Technical Service Bulletins regarding this problem. If there were any, I could possibly have some of the repair costs to be covered by GM. TSBs are issued by car manufacturers and cover problems considered to be not big enough to justify recall. See sample info on http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/tsb/servicemmy1.cfm.
  Anyway, our Lumina was repaired and promptly traded in (for whatever price offered) for brand new '98 Accord - which will be another story. All this problems made me permanently suspicious about Chevrolet and GM cars in general, as many of them share common parts and platforms (and problems?).  I know some people, who use this brand's cars for years without serious problems, but I also know some people who were about as lucky as us. Sounds like a lottery, and chances to win (or at least not to loose) are not high enough to me. The pain of owning Lumina was great, and it cannot be forgotten easily, so we do not consider another (used or new) GM car for foreseeable future. You should decide for yourself, and I hope my opinion is one piece to consider. Thank you for reading.
