            <b>First Impressions</b>
Owning the 1998 Volkswagon PASSAT GLX was less than a pleasurable experience.  I bought the VW as an alternative to a BMW or Mercedes.  That was how favorable it's first impression was on me.  It looked VERY European with the look, feel, comfort and performance of these other high-priced luxury sedans with wood trim, leather seats, climate control, and power everything.  The fact that there was a big ol' VW on the grille didn't bother me at all.  I felt I got a great car at a great price and it was a wonderful car at first, but things went down hill from there.  

<b> The Problems:</b>
In the two years I owned this car, it had three recalls and numerous small problems.  They were: 1) The power seat memory on the driver's seat didn't not work.  2) The truck light would not work.  This was tied into the security system and after opening the truck, the car would re-arm itself requiring me to un-arm it again to get in.  3) The battery went completely dead and would not hold a charge.  If not the fact I had another vehicle to jump it with, it would have to have been towed to the dealership 35 miles away.  When the battery was replaced, the code VW had in its archives for this cars radio didn't work and they were going to order a new radio for it.  4) This is the big one...  It would not run in cold weather.  On a cold start, if I did not get the engine to start on the first hit, it would flood out.  So much so that I could smell the gas coming out of the exhaust.  It delayed me several times because I could not get it started.  When it was running, it had no power in cold weather (under 32 degrees).  This engine was fuel injected so something was seriously wrong there, although it could have been a very simple sensor failing.

<b>Please Pay the Cashier</b>
The drive train warrantee is 10 years/100,000 miles on all internally lubricated parts.  However, the basic warrantee was only 12 months/12 miles.  The dealer was going to charge me for some of the above mentioned repairs.  Not cheap,either, if you can imagine.  Luckily, things like seat memory and truck lights don't affect the performance, but when it started to have the engine problems, I decided that was enough.  I would like to add, that the service department at the VW dealer was first rate.

<b>Bye-bye to Cheap Luxury</b>
I decided I had had enough nickle and dime problems.  I turned the car back in to VW (It was leased) on a trade and said good bye to German engineering.  Maybe in another time and place this would have been a better experience, but I can truly say that after 2 years and 24,000 miles, the 1998 Volkswagon Passat GLX was the nicest lemon I have ever owned.<br><br>
