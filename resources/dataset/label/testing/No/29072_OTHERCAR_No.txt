            I wanted a Jeep ever since I was a kid.  I have childhood pictures of me in a metal &quot;flintstones&quot; type push 'em with you feet a go toy Jeep.  I finally got a chance to purchase a used 1992 Wrangler S. in Jan. 1998 for $8000.  First, I should've done some research of what type of Jeeps were out there.  Second, (see first).  After only owning the Jeep for about two months, the main bearing spun.  Cost of repairs - $1300.  Problem was I bought it from a private owner so there wasn't a warranty to fall back on.  And that was only the beginning.  I have had a major problem every six months since purchase.  The clutch had to be replaced. Cost of repairs - $400 (with discount).  Windshield rust, which is a major problem for Jeeps of all types. Cost of repair - n/a cause I did it myself.  Replaced muffler and exhaust headers - upgrade. Cost - $600.  Other smaller repairs (too much to list) at an estimated cost of $500 total.  And now the Jeep is in the shop due to a leaking clutch master cylinder and leaking slave cylinder (which is located inside the transmission case).  Estimate from shop - $800. And that is if there is no serious contamination to the clutch parts.  If there is, I was told there would be a substantial increase in cost of repairs.  So, there two main points I would like to leave with you.  Research and Research.  That goes for any vehicle, used or new.  I let the desire for a Jeep blind my common sense.  
When the Jeep gets out of the shop, it is definitely goin on sale and I will be purchasing another Jeep.  One that I have been eyeing and have done MUCH research on, inspected, and test driven.  Something I should've done in the first place.<br><br>
