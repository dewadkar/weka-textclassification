            This is the biggest and bulkiest digital camera that I have ever used and I assume it is due in part to the inclusion of the Iomega's Clik! drive the body. No matter how you try to hold it, it just doesn't fit comfortably in your hands and certainly would not be the easiest of items to conceal for top secret photo missions.

The 40MB disks, which look much like mini cd roms, give the CL30 the ability to store between 60 and 360 images, depending on the resolution setting you choose. 

I really prefer using the viewfinder to the LCD because of blurring and changes in color when you even slightly move the camera.  The click wheel next to the LCD controls all menu operation, making it quick and easy to operate.

The most appealing features of this camera is that it offers 1 million pixel (extended to 1.5 million when you use the software package photogenie), a 2X digital zoom, USB-compatible, the ability to change lenses, and the additional storage space from the CLICK! disk storage. One of the disks is included in the camera package and additional ones can be purchased for around $10.00 each.   

Overall, the image quality is quite impressive but the camera is so odd to hold and use that I will often grab my cheapo Polaroid if I am just need a few snapshots at a family reunion or something.  

The only other real complaint I have about this product is that some of the parts on the body of the camera seem cheaply made and I question their durability. One wrong move and I could easily bust off any number of pieces. 

At $450.00, you be the judge on what features matter most to you in a digital camera.  Personally, I think I paid about $150.00 too much but what can I say?  I am a sucker for gadgets.
