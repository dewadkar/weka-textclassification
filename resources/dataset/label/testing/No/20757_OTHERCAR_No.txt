            My mother bought a brand new Blazer a couple of years back. She has had alot of problems out of her blazer, like computer chips going out and the battery going dead. Her Bazer began making funny sounds when she tried to pass people, and her wind shield wipers went out while we were on a road trip and it was pouring down rain. Did she just get a bad one out of the bunch? No, actually, a couple of people she works with have been unhappy with thier Blazers. She recently traded it in and got her another vehicle, and id happy to see it go. <br><br>
