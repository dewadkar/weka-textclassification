            With a goal of driving only great autos through the journey of life, my 1998 Disco (not my first SUV) replaced an Audi A4 Quattro. Shakespeare pointed out we need a foil to appreciate the good. In the cosmic sense, I was due! 

From the oozing of the insulation through bottom of the doors on warm days, to the sun roofs that ended up being totally reinstalled, to the electrical spooks that always emerge on the airport dash, to the power steering fluid that floods the garage (total mechanism change out finally required, to the mobile front seat that thinks it is part of a rowing machine, to the post card that just arrived to tell me my new springs had arrived to cure the decided sinking of the right rear corner of the vehicle, dashed my faith in my fellow Brits to finally produce a reliable great auto.   After 22 months and 17,000 miles absolute disappointment.  

I love the utility. I love the design. I was duped by the promise of durability.  My hopes for the future were dashed when the new Disco II loaner (leaps ahead in numerous ways) was offered up with cupholder dangling from the dash. This is the basis of a long slide into oblivion for the marque. Save yourself the heartache... look elsewhere. <br><br>
