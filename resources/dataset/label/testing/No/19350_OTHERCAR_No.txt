            When my 2001 Ford Explorer Sport was acting up again (see my review), I rented an Infiniti I30 for almost 2 weeks as I do a lot of driving for work.

<b>Engine</b>:
Much is said about Infiniti's smooth-as-silk engines and I was very impressed at how fast I could get this full size 4-door car going onto the on ramps and up hills.

<b>Handling</b>:
Infiniti's target audience may not really care about sports sedan handling, but the Infiniti delivers sharp handling though soft in the corners - this car handles more like a Buick Regal Sport than anything from Germany.

<b>Interior</b>:
Beautifully appointed leather interior. Japanese-luxo-standard dash board was a litte disappointed since it wasn't unique - was I sitting in a Lexus, a Camry or a Maxima? The rear deck has this electric windscreen to provide some shade for the rear passengers. It looks silly and tacky. The sound system was disappointingly tinny - especially compared to the sound systems I've had in Fords!

<b>Exterior</b>:
Ever since the Q45, Infiniti has had a problem defining their styling niche and their market niche. While Lexus has been happy to clone Mercedes styling, Infiniti almost seems to be happy with the "Toyota Avalon" approach - big, bland versions of anonymous Japanese sedans. It's a shame that the I30 isn't more interesting to look at since it is a very nice car to drive. Infinitis are made by Nissan and the Nissan Maxima is actually the same car as the I30, built on the same platform with the same engine! And in my opinion, the Maxima is a smarter looking design with sportier lines.

<b>Value</b>:
Well, with a luxury car, value is computed differently - does the I30 have all the luxurious appointments one would expect in a sports sedan? Yes. Is it a good driver? Yes. Is it worth $29,000? Tough one. 

While I was filling the I30 at a gas station, I saw a Mercedes billboard advertising the C240 starting at $29,500. I immediately wondered why would anyone pay $29K for the Infiniti. Mercedes has long since developed the prestige and cachet for their car line - Infiniti has not, so the I30 loses the battle in value. For a luxury and prestige car, I'd rather have a Mercedes over an Infiniti - especially when the pricing is so close. If you have to have Nissan-engineering, the I30 is a nice car, but when it comes to value, a luxury edition Nissan Maxima GLE is a couple thousand less.
