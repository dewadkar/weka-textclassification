            I bought a 1995 Buick Skylark about a year ago, looking for a sturdy, reliable vehicle to take me to and from work. I've never been a car guy. I don't really want to mess with my car besides getting the oil changed and the tires rotated every so often. I just want it to take me to where I want to go. You won't find me outside on a sunny, Saturday afternoon washing and waxing my car. That's just not my thing. When I got the car, I was looking for something that wouldn't break down, wouldn't make mysterious noises, or leak different colored fluids. 

With that being said, I got the car with close to 80,000 miles on it. I've since put 10,000 more miles on it. But, I've also put in a new transmission. Transmission problems are expensive, and this one costs me close to $1,500. I can't say I was pleased with having to replace the transmission in the car, but it wasn't completely unexpected. The car had a lot of miles on it for its age, and as long as it remains problem free for another year or so, I'll be happy with that.

I'll start with the good points. The interior of the car is excellent in all respects. The seats are comfy and there is plenty of room inside the car. All the objects on the dashboard are easy to see and reach. The car is relatively free of blindspots. You can see out the back and sides of the car without straining your back or neck. The trunk has plenty of storage room. I recently took a ten hour trip in the car, and even though the trunk and back seats were loaded with items, it was a very comfortable, easy road trip. 

The car is also very quiet. When I first got the car, the lack of noise from the engine and the road made me uneasy. It took a little while to get used to how quiet the interior or the car actually was. I now drive with the driver's side window cracked a bit just to give me a bit of the noise I'm used to while driving a car.

But, the Skylark also has problems. Besides the transmission problems I stated earlier, this car is completely lacking in power. You won't have fun climbing a steep hill or trying to speed up in a hurry to avoid something in the road. This car just doesn't have the horsepower to pull it off. The car won't shake at 80mph, but you might be shaking in a rage while trying to get the car up to that speed. I'm really a very conservative driver, and at times, the car really frustrated me. I've never been disappointed in a car's performance before, but the Skylark really needs a six cylinder engine to carry its weight. 

I really wouldn't recommend this car merely on the power factor. It seems a bit expensive for what you get in terms of the engine size. But, it might make a good family car, for driving around the city with the kids in the back.<br><br>
