            There's nothing like the immediate gratification of a digital camera.  It's like a Polaroid camera but without the expense of all that film.  Pictures can be quickly and easily edited and emailed out to interested parties the following day.

I found the Kodak DC240 digital camera on sale at buy.com for a great price.  I had my heart set on buying a digital camera as a birthday present to myself.  The price was pretty good and I ordered it right up.

Now I wish I had waited and research camera options beforehand.  Not that this is a bad camera, it's small enough to go anywhere, it takes a ton of pictures (as long as you have extra batteries), the quality of the images is decent even at low resolution and the filters are fun and easy to use.

It works best indoors in well lit areas, I have found the the flash is too bright for dim outdoors pictures.  You tend to get a bleached out subject against a dark background.  The camera has limited shutter settings, you can set the shutter to + or - 2 stops.  This makes it very difficult to take pictures outdoors or in low light.  

The display is small and difficult to judge your images from. It also has a brightness control lever on the bottom of the camera right where you hold it, so you are always accidentally resetting the brightness of the display.  This makes it even more difficult to judge the correct light for the picture you're taking.

The interface that allows you to preview pictures and settings is extremely easy to use.  You just bring up the menu and click your way through the well defined options.  I rarely had to refer to the manual after the first browse through.  The software that allows you to download your pictures is simple as well, easy to install and easy to use.

All in all, I've taken some good pictures that I was very happy with but also spent 2 hours in Photoshop trying to get one good picture from an outdoor event.  It's not what I was hoping for in digital cameras.  I would suggest that anyone who is in the market research the camera they are going to buy thoroughly.  Make sure you go to a store and actually play with it, or find someone who has it and ask them about it.
