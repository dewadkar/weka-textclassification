            I originally purchased this vehicle because a relative owned one and I had driven it a few times. It very much passes the grade in the following areas - comfort, space, viewing area (windows), versatility and looks.
It failed in the following areas, mostly mechanical and service.
1) Condensation in the PCV valve line froze and the resultant pressure forced oil from somewhere over the engine (Service - fixed without question with the comment &quot;the Mitsubishi engine does that).
2) Noticeable hesitation when the A/C clutches in and out (Service - changed the engine and transmission mounts. This transferred a vibration throughout the vehicle which they couldn't or wouldn't fix.
3) When the van is first started and backed out of the driveway and it is put in drive, there is a hesitation, almost to the point of stalling. (Service - Carbon build up in the throttle body from &quot;burning regular unleaded fuel&quot;. The manual tells you to &quot;burn regular unleaded fuel&quot;. They would not fix it under warranty. Again I got the comment &quot;the Mitsubishi engine does that&quot;).
4) Rattles in the doors, especially when it is cold out. (Service - cannot find the problem).

The comment &quot;the Mitsubishi engine does that&quot; came up several more times for minor things.<br><br>
