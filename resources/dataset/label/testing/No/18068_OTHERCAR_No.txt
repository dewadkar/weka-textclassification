            I bought my first new car in August of 1996. The Neon was cute and affordable. It also only had 10 miles on it. I was so excited!

My 1996 Dodge Neon is a Highline coupe and is black with grey interior. It has a 5 speed manual transmission. It also has air conditioning, rear defrost, a spoiler, aluminum American Racing wheels, and the optional Neon floor mats. 

My neon has a very smooth ride up until you reach 60 - 65 mph. Than it tends to shake a little.

Unfortunately, since then, I have had the head gasket replaced once, the cam seal replaced twice, and the air conditioning system replaced three times. I also had to replace the fuel pump, a rear seal, and numerous other things including the brakes. I'd also like to mention that about 30% of the time, when i step on my brakes, the left blinker comes on. I have had it into numerous repair shops.

The Dodge dealerships I have taken the car to be repaired at were less than helpful. 

A true story: I took my car in for an oil leak that ended up being the cam seal and the rear seal, and cost me $550.00 to repair. When I picked up my car, it had a HUGE gash in the hood, and when I started it up, it began screeching at me. I walked right back into the dealership and complained. They gave me a loaner that's been around longer than I've been driving, and told me they would see what they could do. The next day they returned my car to me. They used touch up paint on the hood, and ended up adjusting the clutch. Strange, they took no blame for either problem, but fixed them both for free. Then I noticed something sticking out of my hood. I'm not kidding. I took it back, and the thing sticking out of my hood ended up being the cover to my clutch! They forgot to put it back on!!!! 

I have been lied to at a few other Dodge dealerships about the price of repairs. They would tell me one price,  and tell my boyfriend a much lower price. I have not been treated fairly at any Dodge dealership I've ever had repairs at.

The only good things about my Neon is that the exterior is still in mint condition and I will make my last loan payment in 5 months. I've heard that the 95 and 96 neons have problems with the paint peeling, but I haven't experienced that problem myself.

I wouldn't recommend the purchase of a 1996 Dodge Neon because of all the problems I've had with mine. Oh, and stay away from the dealerships if you are female! They will tell you anything they think you will believe!
