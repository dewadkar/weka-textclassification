            I bought my 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier from a 'friend' of mine, and paid a meager $2995 for it.  The Cavalier had 120k when I bought it.  

When I bought the Cavalier, the air conditioning had already stopped working, and it didn't sound very healthy.  Also, whenever I put the car in Drive, it would make a loud "CLUNK" noise.

My Cavalier ran without incident for about 3 months until. . . .

I pulled up to a stop light in a busy metropolitan area and I had the car in PARK.  The light turned green, and I put it into DRIVE, then the car jerked, and stalled.  I put the car back in PARK, and started it again.  As soon as I put it into DRIVE, it stalled.  After doing this for about 5 minutes, I finally got the car to go. . .until I stopped again. . .Somehow, I made it onto the highway and got home.
The next day I took it to an authorized service center and they diagnosed the problem as such:  "Ya got a f&%^#$ up TCC, gonna cost at least $800 big ones"  I gasped.  I drove the car with the stalling problem for another week.  I went on line, and decoded the mechanics message.  Apparently the Torque Converter Clutch (Hence TCC) Solenoid had gone out, a fairly common problem among Cavaliers. . .  

I went to a mechanic of good repute that specialized in Transmissions.  He fixed the car for $250, a far cry from the $800 that the authorized dealer had quoted me.

The next month, I was having the oil changed, the man at the oil change place, said that he smelled gas, and that I should have the car looked at. . .

I took the car back to the dealership, the same one that had given me the substandard service prior.  This time, he said that it was a seal on one of the fuel injectors.  This time, he quoted me the rediculous price of $600.  I told him that I'd rather burn up in flames on the highway then pay that price!

I took it to a mechanic, and he replaced the seal.  Still leaking.  Tried a different seal.  Still leaking.  The only reason that he had replaced the seal was because that was the diagnosis coming from the dealer.  Finally we replaced the faulty fuel injector, which had been gushing gas for the last several days.

After that, I decided it was time for the Cavalier to go. . .Sold in the Thrifty Nickel for $3600, so I really can't complain over my cars performance.
