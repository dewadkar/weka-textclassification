            It looks like a wagon, has the suspension of an SUV, and drives like a car.  Does this make a good combination?  Well, it could.  But there are some general flaws which have me a bit disenchanted with this vehicle, which I've been driving for the last few weeks.

Subaru is prevalent in Alaska.  In the late 70's and early 80's they really captured the non-traditional 4WD market with their 4WD sedans and wagons, and Alaskan's sucked them up.  We've got repair shops that do nothing but work on Subarus, that's how popular they are.  I have typically watched from the outside, though, unimpressed with their designs and untouched by their marketing.  The Forester is the closest I've come to owning one, and although I'm in the market to buy an SUV, I'm leaning away from this vehicle.  Let me tell you why...

<b>The Good</b>
<i>Driving Performance</i>
This vehicle handles nicely.  I've taken some steep hills and tight corners in this car, and I have to say it outperforms my Mitsubishi Montero (see my review) in this regard.  The steering is tight, giving you adequate feel of the road and good response.  Because of the low center-of-gravity, there is no lean on corners as you can expect with most SUVs.  The suspension was firm yet soft enough that you weren't concerned about every passing blemish on the road (believe me, we have them in Alaska). This was very noticeable and impressive.

<i>Power</i>
I was pleased with the power the Forester provided me. It's listed at 165 hp, which is more than adequate for the 3,000 pounds it pulls.  My Montero weights in at around 4,300 pounds and is a bit underpowered with its 199 hp engine.  The four cylinder engine serves the Forester very well--I was surprised by this.

<i>Fuel Efficiency</i>
It is listed at 21/28 mpg, which any SUV owner recognizes as pretty darn good.  I get 25 on average and am pleased with that. 

<i>Top Rack</i>
The vehicle I drive has the optional roof rack with attachments for bicycles.  It's rather elaborate, but notedly handy.  Other SUVs might suffer from 'height envy' in that it isn't an option to use a rack because of the inability of owners to access the top of their vehicles.

<b>The Bad</b>
<i>Seat Comfort</i>
I rate this better than average.  I'm a real stickler here because I suffer from back pain.  If I ride over 1 hour in these seats, I feel pain.  It do appreciate the simple but effective lumbar and hip 'dials' on the left side of the driver's seat.  Their range is good and the action is noticeable.  General seat comfort, though, wasn't near that of my standard--the Montero.

<i>Leg Room</i>
Rear seat leg room is terrible.  I find this unforgiveable in such a vehicle.  It's not as if there is a lack of space in the cabin, they just pushed the seats 4 or 5 inches too close to the driver's seat.  My children cannot ride in this vehicle without complaining, and they have yet to reach 7 years old.  Adults have it much worse.  I don't understand this at all and really fault Subaru for this flaw.

<i>Touchy Gas</i>
Although the vehicle has good power, the gas is extremely touchy.  I found myself jumping quite often off a green light.  I have to make a conscious effort to ease into the gas each time I stop.  This should be fixed, as it could easily cause fender-benders or worse.  Moreover, the brake is the opposite--a bit unresponsive.  So while I have to tickle the gas, I have to power into the brake, which seems inconsistent with what I'm used to.

<i>Cup Holder</i>
Excuse me, but one cup holder in the front is no longer acceptable.  I realize the Japanese don't take to drinking coffee in their luxury vehicles, but this car must have two cupholders to compete with the Toyotas and Hondas in this class.

<i>Dorky Compass</i>
Ok, granted it's a minor detail and doesn't affect the overall performance of the car (as can be said of the previous item), but the compass has got to go.  

There is this strange digital compass above the radio that shows a backlit display of a vehicle riding down the road with a digital display of the direction you are heading in the form of a large 'W' or 'N' or 'S' or 'E' above this  car image.  

It reminds me of those early racing video games we used to play at Shakey's Pizza Parlor, trying to keep the car between the center lines as we went down the track.

Well, I've grown up now, I don't need the compass and definitely don't want the distraction.

<i>Interior</i>
I don't appreciate all the plastic accomodations in the dashboard.  While the displays are good and visible, I get a sense of 'cheap' when I see the marbled wood design in a rather cheap-looking plastic design.

<i>Door Handles</i>
The handles have a cute kind of snap action.  While most cars require lifting, these require pulling a lever outward.  I liked it until my daughter caught her finger in the lever.  No major damage, just a small flesh wound. But enough to make me realize the danger for small children.

<i>Door Locks</i>
Up is down and down is up.  I still can't figure this out, even as I explain it.  Most auto-locks designate lock as down and unlock as up--not Subaru, apparently.  I fiddle with this each day trying to get it right. I press up to lock the doors and down to unlock them--go figure.

<b>Conclusion</b>
This vehicle got great safety reviews upon its first release, and deserves consideration by those in the market for SUVs.  I must, however, warn families regarding the size.  It is just inadequate in this very important category.  If the back seats had 5 more inches of legroom, I would change this opinion from a no-recommend to a yes just because I know the brand, like the price, and appreciate the performance.
