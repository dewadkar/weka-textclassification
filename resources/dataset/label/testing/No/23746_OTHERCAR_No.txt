            My 1998 Volkswagon Jetta turned out to be a burden. After trying to work patiently with the Dealer, Jim Sampson Motors,  to overcome the Brake Failure during certain winter conditions, I've made seven or eight trips to the Dealer in Sydney, N.S., who tried to overcome the problem with my
brakes. We even had contact with the Volkswagon Head Office in Canada, which have sent a Volkswagon Car Specialist, who could not seem to be able to fix the problem. In my opinion, my car is dangerous under certain weather condition in the winter and as the company did not seem to offer
me a satisfactory deal to exchange the car if they cannot fix it. After a year and a half of this problem, my patience has run out. I have come to the Internet to expose my problem and see if there is anyone else that has the same problem with their Jetta.
