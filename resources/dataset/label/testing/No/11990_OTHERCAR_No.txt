            Well,

I bought this vehicle for transportation to school and work, as I just recently graduated high school I don't have much money. During summer vacation one year this Mitsubishi dealership was at our mall doing a auto show, showing all the '98 line of Mitsu's. I was looking at the Eclipse, and the Montero, and even the Galant as well as of course the Mirage. I decided that the Eclipse was a nice looking car but out of my price range, the others were aswell, the only car that fit into my price range was of course the Mirage. After doing some comparing with other cars in it's class, the Escort, Neon, Civic, and such, I decided that the Mirage was the best bang for the buck, it does not have a bad rep as the neon and escort do ;) It looked kewl and seemed like a heck of a deal. Well I decided to get red paint, black interior, and a 5-speed manual. I bought it for about $12,000 tax, tag, and title out the door. Now, being that I have had the car almost 2 years I notice rattles, car squeaks when you get in and out of the car, the seats are uncomfortable and the fabric is cheap (already been reapulstered), I have had the thing in the shop to be repainted due to the paint peeling off or turning into this &quot;goop&quot;. The battery exploaded, currently in the shop for that, as well as some paint work on the trunk of the car that has to be done. Basically it has been in the shop way too much for a new car. Currently it has been in the shop a total of about 3 months in the past 2 years. Every day I don't have that car, I have to borrow one from my parents, because the dealer does not provide a loaner, and their rental service requires that the driver is 23 years old, I am not ;( So not only am I out of MY car, but I have to ask my parents to use theirs, they don't like that too much, I am in the process of writing Mitsubishi about this car, it seems to be a lemon. Due to the battery acid going everywhere in the engine compartment it started eating all the metal the acid touched, basically ruined the car 
(NOTE: car only has 11,212 miles on it!!! And car is clean and has been taking care of, even garaged kept!!). I would not, and have not recomended this car to friends, I will be fixing this car, or getting Mitsubishi to compensate me for my loss, then I will be buying a 2000 Celica GT-S!!!<br><br>
