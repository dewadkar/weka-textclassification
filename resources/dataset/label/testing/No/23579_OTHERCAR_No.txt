            When I heard that the Toyota Altezza was coming to these shores as the Lexus IS300, I was ready to step in line.  I had seen the Altezza in a Toyota dealership on a trip to Japan, and the specs seemed exciting.  I went to the Lexus dealer in March and put myself on their mailing list.

July came around.  I had held off on buying a car to wait for the IS.  And I bought something else after the test drive.

Dynamically, there was not much to fault with the car.  The lack of a 5 speed was a great disappointment, since this car was supposed to target enthusiasts.  Still, the inline 6 is smooth with ample torque throughout the rev range.  The car seemed competitive in acceleration, braking.  The shorter wheelbase gave the car a quick turn in, without sacrificing much in stability.  The tight suspension keeps the car balanced, but the ride is a little on the harsh side. 

The e-shift is best left in auto.  The position of the swich makes it difficult to find the buttons in turns, and unless you use it all the time, it's not easy to get into the right gear.  This is too bad, this car might really be fun to drive.  

Inside...
I felt cramped at the shoulders in the IS, while leg and head room seemed acceptable with the seat leaned back.  The next-gen look did not bother me so much, but there were things that did.  Coming from the A4, it was like going from the Ritz Carlton to Holiday inn.  The climate control and audio switches felt unworthy of the Lexus price tag.  I liked the steering wheel and the chromed shift knob, but the chronograph instrument cluster was a little hard to read.  The seats were comfortable, with perforated suede-like 'leather seating surfaces'.   They felt nice and cool to the touch, but this is nowhere near the quality of leather in their other cars.

Outside...
For the most part, the Lexus has sharp, angular lines that enhance its sportiness.   The only objection I have to the styling is the use of the chromed turn signal mounts.  Let the Fast and Furious guys put those on after they buy the car, if they want to.  For the rest of us, plain red/amber plastic will do.  The Antenna on the back of the roof is not retractable, and yes, it does look , umm, unique.

Open the trunk, and well, it's about the size of the E36 BMW trunk.  You might expect hydraulic, nonintrusive hinges at this price.  And you would not expect to have to hold up the hood.  At nearly 3400 pounds, the IS isn't exactly the class lightweight, so don't accept arguments about 'trying to shave every unnecessary pound' here.  

summing it up...
Lexus promised to take things to the edge with this car, but they were half-hearted in their delivery.  So instead of having a car that is an entry level luxury sport sedan with the heaviest emphasis on sport, you have an expensive 4 door that is neither a sports car or a luxury car.   Still, with refinement and a manual shifter, it could really become a wonderful car. 

I was really ready to love the car.  At the time, people were still waiting in line for it, and Lexus stood firm by the MSRP.  A 15% reduction from MSRP would have made it a real tough choice.  As it was, the lexus would have needed to be a clearly superior driver.  Since it was not, I had no trouble choosing the bigger, faster, better appointed CL type S.
