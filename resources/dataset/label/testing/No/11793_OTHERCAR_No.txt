            As a result of my personal experience with 3 different Volvo automobiles, I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone ever buy a Volvo car.

The reason for this is Volvo's apparent ongoing quality control problems.  Ironically, Volvo cars are beautifully designed in many ways, and generally comfortable to use when they are not breaking down.

My parents owned a new Volvo 240, back in the late 1970's.  The fuel injection system on this car had recurring problems, throughout the 7 or 8 years they owned the car (including once stranding them, on a cross-country road trip).

My most extensive personal experience with Volvo is with a 1996 Volvo 960, and with the 1989 Volvo 740 which preceded it.  These two cars were actually owned (in succession) by my girlfriend, and I was extensively involved with these cars from about 1993 to 1999.  I also have a close friend who buys a luxury car about every 3 years as his business automobile, and who purchased a new Volvo S70 a few years ago.  He became so frustrated with things that went wrong with it in the first 1-1/2 years, that he traded it in and obtained a new BMW (which so far he likes much better).

When I first was getting more involved with the 1989 Volvo 740, I kept hearing about many problems my girlfriend had had with it. (The car was always carefully maintained, from time of purchase.)  I experienced one of these frustrations when the car stranded us on the highway, on the way to Chicago, around 1995.

Thus I was almost incredulous when she decided to buy another Volvo.  (Some people are just not tuned in to cars!)  Unfortunately, the 1996 Volvo 960 she purchased ended up having many problems, in every one of the 3 years she owned it.  When this car was purchased new, it happened to be the most expensive automobile that Volvo offered (at around $35,000 for the station wagon version).  Among other smaller problems, within the first 2 years of ownership, the car needed a repair to a major front suspension component (a control arm that became defective), and also had the alternator fail (with less than 25,000 miles on the car).

I used to repair my own cars, and have always carefully maintained and been &quot;in tune with&quot; the various cars with which I'm involved.  These have included 2 Volkswagens, 3 Toyotas, 3 Hondas, a Chrysler minivan, and my current Nissan Maxima.  The 2 luxury Volvos with which I had the most involvement (as outlined above) were sore disappointments.  I advise people to stick with Honda or Toyota, or a suitable equivalent, but avoid Volvo at all cost!<br><br>
