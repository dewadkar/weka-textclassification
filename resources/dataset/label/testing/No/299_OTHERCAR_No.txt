            I've taken some flack over the review I submitted last year for the 2001 Toyota MR2 Spyder, primarily as I predicted from other MR2 Spyder owners who felt "slighted" by the review.  However, prospective buyers and people of a more neutral "ilk" will see that I was very even-handed pointing out both the good and bad after a year of ownership.

I decided to revisit the review and see if there was anything I should change or if there was anything that needed to be addressed, etc.

First I thought I'd start by addressing comments from MR2 Spyder owners who read the review.

1) "I bought it because it is rare" - One owner went so far as the claim that the MR2 Spyder is more rare than a Ferrari in their neighborhood.  Must be a nice neighborhood because the MR2 Spyder isn't more rare than a Ferrari, in fact, while it might be more rare than a Honda Accord, there were nearly the same number of MR2 Spyders and Camaros sold this last year.  Additionally, the MR2 Spyder has now had 3 years of models available and the 2003 models will be in showrooms shortly.  While I can't change someone's personal opinion about what is or isn't "rare", I don't consider something that rolls off an assembly line in Japan and which can be purchased anywhere in the country as "rare".  So while I admit that this might hold value for some buyers, it isn't anything that I place a value on and isn't of a very substantive nature.

2) "I bought it because it was the best bang for the buck" - I hear this phrase a lot in car enthusiast circles.  Generally it is tossed around when someone is trying to compare their car to a more expensive car that they couldn't afford so they make themselves feel better by raising the "bang for the buck" argument.  I guess it depends on how you define "bang".  If you are talking 1/4 mile speed then you'd be much better off buying a Ford Mustang than the MR2 Spyder.  If you are talking handling then there are still other cars you could buy but the MR2 Spyder does handle well for its size.  I suspect, however, that very very few MR2 owners will ever take their car onto the racetrack or compete in an autox event where the handling of the car will make a difference.  In every day driving I don't think the bang for the buck argument really holds much weight.

3) "People stare at me, I get noticed" - Vanity, pure and simple.  I suppose if you wore a rainbow colored wig and held up a John 3:16 sign people would probably stare at you as well.  A number of car magazines as well as a number of individuals that I've talked to about the MR2 Spyder's looks don't find the car particularly attractive.  I had a chance to see the new Miata very near the MR Spyder at a recent car show and there was no comparison, the Miata was better looking in my opinion.  There are a number of people who attach neon lights to their car or apply "Type R" stickers in order to get noticed.  If you really want to get noticed, buy a new BMW Mini-Cooper with the British Flag on top and racing stripes, that ought to get you noticed and you'll have a lot more storage room, the same performance, and BMW backing you up instead of Toyota and at around the same price or possibly less.

4) "My car isn't supposed to be compared to Porsche or BMW, but the fact that it is makes it a great car". - Comparisons are a fact of life, and Toyota brought on some of these comparisons by 1) Copying some of the distinctive body lines of the Porsche Boxster and 2) Begging magazines to do head to head tests with the Mazda Miata.  This really goes back to last year's review about MR2 Spyder owners having something to "prove" or feeling the need to "defend" their cars all the time.  I could compare the MR2 Spyder to the BMW Z8 and the Spyder would lose in every category, I don't see how that somehow makes the Spyder a great car.  The Miata is certainly the closest comparison in terms of size and price, but even these two cars are vastly different and should be compared directly by prospective buyers before making a purchase decision.  Ask yourself this, if you walked into a Toyota dealership and they were comparing the MR2 Spyder to a Porsche Boxster, basically giving you the line that the MR2 Spyder was the same performance for $20,000 less would you believe that you were buying the actual equivalent of the Boxster?  Probably not.  It's a sales technique, make the buyer feel that they are getting something more glamorous than they really are.  The same way that Pontiac is selling its new station wagon as the "Vibe" targeted at a younger market that doesn't remember the negative connotations of a "station wagon".

5) "KenDude is an idiot because he changed his opinion from 2000 to 2001" - Well it's hard to defend oneself from being called an idiot, what do I say? "No I'm not!" "Sticks and Stones... etc?"  About all I can say is that the 2000 opinion was written shortly after getting a new car, having that car slammed on, and feeling the need to defend it.  The 2001 opinion, and this one, were after having spent time with the car in a variety of conditions and circumstances.  Are people entitled to change their opinions? I think so, but obviously some people will disagree with me on that statement.  In my opinon, and that's why we are here isn't it? Opinions? in my opinion the MR2 Spyder appeals to a limited audience and I am not a member of that audience.  Prospective buyers should examine cars similar to the Spyder before making a purchase decision and not base their decision on a glowing report from someone who just purchased the car or dealer statements that the car is just as good as "X".

2002 Update
Not much changed for the MR2 Spyder in 2002, evidence still suggests some timing chain and/or other mechanical problems with the engine are possible.  On the positive side, a greater number of aftermarket products are available for the car now, but some owners will find that a negative over time.  The ride is still borderline harsh when compared to other roadsters, the storage space is still very limited, and the interior while spacious for a car of its size, still lacks some of the amenities and finishing touches that competitors offer.

Driving report - I drove a 2002 from a local dealer for grins to see how it compared after not having driven one for a year.  The lack of power was still very noticable, but so was the ability to corner well, although not as tight at low speeds as I had remembered.  The shifter felt stiffer to me than I remembered, but of course that can vary among cars in a single production cycle.  Maybe it is the comfort of the seats on my daily driver, but I actually found the seats uncomfortable on just my short test drive. (This car had leather seats).  The most amusing thing was when I got back to the dealership the salesperson said they "might" be able to knock a couple hundred off the sticker price.  Yes indeed, Toyota dealers still trying to sell these cars for MSRP!  What a hoot!  I guess that is better than trying to sell it for over MSRP, but during the winter months I expected better.

Last but not least I was also criticized for saying that the MR2 Spyder's resale value had come down to be more "normal" or more like other Toyotas, not the "in the clouds" resale that occurred early in the first year due to limited supply and markups.  How I am responsible for supply and demand is beyond me, but to back up my claims I checked the online Kelly Blue Book value of a 2000 MR2 Spyder with low miles and in excellent condition and it came back with $16,900 for trade in, in Good condition this dropped all the way down to $14,475.  I also ran the expected sale price for selling to an individual and those ran from $18,200-$19,400. This amounts to about a 28% drop in the value of the car in 2 years, or 14% per year on average which is similar to other Toyotas as I had stated.

2003 Report
According to one "insider" report, not much has changed for 2003 either, just cosmetics, but since Toyota has yet to officially release anything, it's always best to wait if you think you might be wanting a 2003 vs. a 2002.  Then again, some dealers are offering incentives on 2002's that we might not see on 2003's if the economy picks up.

Final Thoughts

There hasn't been anything to make me change my opinion of this car from last year, pretty much everything I stated still holds true aside from minor changes that may have addressed particular issues.  Therefore I strongly recommend that prospective MR2 Spyder buyers investigate similar cars to the MR2 Spyder like the Miata, perhaps even up to the Honda S2000, or if a convertible isn't that important, maybe even a Mini Cooper before making a buying decision.  Be certain that the MR2 Spyder is really the car for you unless you don't plan to keep the car more than a year or two anyway and just want some form of fun transportation despite the obvious flaws.
