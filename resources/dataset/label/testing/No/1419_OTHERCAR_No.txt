            I own a 98 Neon, I like it, and at the same time I wish I hadn't bought it.  Its great in certain areas; style, acoustical qualities of the interior, trunk space, gas mileage, comfort.  In some areas though the Neon is seriously lacking, for instance security.

  Let me pass along a brief story of something that happened to me.  At work, I had to drive my neon to another local branch of U-Haul, put my neon on a car dolly and hook that up to a truck to drive back to my branch of U-Haul.  Expect like the doofus that I sometimes am, I locked my keys in the beast while it was waiting to go up the dolly.

  I called my branch and told them my situation so they wouldn't expect me back anytime soon when one of my co-workers told me how I could get into my car without any damage (cosmetic or otherwise) in about 15 seconds.  It turns out with a flathead screwdriver and a 2nd person you can pull back the glass on the windows far enough to stick your arm down and unlock the door, if your skinny.  

After learning that little trick I never leave anything valuable in my car anymore, and I'm thinking of investing in a lo-jack considering how easy it is to break into.  Overall, the Neon isn't a bad car, it just has a few problems.<br><br>
