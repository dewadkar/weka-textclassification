            All right, this is my first review so bear with me.  Over Spring Break, my parents and I decided to take a little road trip.  Along for the ride were my two nieces and my nephew.  Obviously, we had to rent an automobile because our 2 Nissan Sentras weren't going to cut it.  When we had gone on family trips before, we've always rented minivans (when the nieces and nephew tagged along) or a normal sized car (when it's just my parents and me).  Of course, my mom started looking for a minivan to rent, but the rental company was out of them.  But they had a Dodge Durango available.  Woohoo!  We get to drive a SUV.  Before this trip, I had never driven a SUV in my life.  My mom liked the Durango's looks.  My dad likes truck in general.  We made an agreement that we would rotate driving (my dad, my niece and me).  Mom had a chance to drive the SUV from the rental company.  She said it was OK.  I have to tell you something.  Although the Durango looks good, it is CRAMPED inside.  We rented one with the third rear seat.  I felt sorry for my older niece who had to sit back there.  I'm about 5'8&quot; and she's about 5'5&quot;.  She didn't complain much, but when we talking about changing the seating arrangement during one of our stops, she told me that I probably won't be comfortable back there.  I asked her if it's really tight back there, and she said &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot;  Now I was sitting in the &quot;real&quot; back seat, and I was OK.  Although, I don't think I would've been comfortable if my mom was 6'0&quot;.  I always ask her to pull the seat up when I have to sit behind her.  So now for my driving experience.  For a V8, the thing didn't have much acceleration.  I mentioned this to my mom, and she said my dad said the same thing.  I even mentioned it to my niece, and she agreed too.  I have to say that after driving the Durango, I've been re-thinking my decision about getting an SUV.  The truck-like feel isn't for me.  The thing is also big.  But I guess most SUVs that size would generate similar feelings from me.  I liked the high ground clearance, but I hated parking because I felt like I would hit the car next to me.  I can't even imagine trying to park an Excursion or Suburban.  The sound system in the Durango we rented was OK.  It had good bass to it.  The seats were also comfortable.  But if I would've sat in the third seat, I know I would've been going crazy.  One more thing, the third rear seat also limits trunk space in the back.  What a pain!  I think my mom has changed her mind about the Durango.  <br><br>
