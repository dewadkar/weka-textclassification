            I purchased my 1992 Chevrolet Beretta GT as a first car.  I am 17 yrs old and have only had this car about 6 months.  I purchased it from a auto repair shop for $3500.  At first I loved the car.  Then I began to hate it.

Heres why:

In 6 months, both my driver and passenger window are completely screwed up and you need to use both hands to roll them up straight.  It appears that there is a lot of wear on the little plastic strips that outline the door/window.

With my automatic transmission, You need to put it in one gear below in order to get the gear above.

The steering is very tight and making slight turns become huge turns.

The ABS light remains illuminated and I cannot find a mechanic who honestly knows what the problem is and I have paid 500+ dollars in different parts that have not yet fixed the problem.

My car is a very feminine Blue/Turquoise color which I hate.

I had big plans of getting a bunch of stereo equipment for my car and getting a paint job etc. but I will end up paying so much money to fix these problems that I will not be able to.  UGHH!

Never get a Beretta/Corsica!!  EVER.
