            I bought my 1994 Tracker in 1997, used. It had low mileage (30,000), was a manual two-door, two-wheel drive softtop in bright green.  It was in solid shape with excellent finish and a decent interior in black.

Over the two and a half years I owned this vehicle before I traded it on a 2000 Kia Sportage, I accumulated 7000 miles a year driving to and from mass-transit parking lots and going out on occasional long trips on weekends.

The vehicle was noisy, drafty, had a ride worse than a buckboard due to its tiny wheelbase, prone to so many rattles and squeaks I could have conducted a symphony of them. 

Gas mileage was okay, but not as phenomenal as I had been led to believe, especially if the a/c was on or if you pushed the 1.6 liter engine too hard.  Reverse gear frequently balked. However, the vehicle did start predictably in all weather and was nimble enough, if not exceptionally sporty.  Body-roll was significant.

Even though I bought an extended warranty (which, as in many instances, turned out to cover nothing that ever went wrong with the vehicle), I wound up spending a small fortune on regular maintenance and replacement parts. The exhaust system is a two-piece unit.  The lower half rusted through on my Geo. Replacement, including labor, at a cheap neighborhood gas station (after getting estimates everywhere): $560.00. The pedal covers wore through in record time. Replacement from the local Chevy dealer: $18 a piece! The dashboard air-duct grilles cracked and broke in regular use (&quot;sun problems,&quot; the dealer said, even though my windows were tinted!) - replacement - $35 a piece! The crowning event: After surgery, I was unable to use the vehicle for 45 days and it sat. The battery discharged, the &quot;theft secure&quot; stereo (which was quite good) needed a &quot;code&quot; entered when I replaced the battery. No such luck, as I had bought a used vehicle and this information was unavailable... I made the trek to the dealer to be told that they have &quot;no way of knowing and there is no override.&quot; I checked with Delco on that and found the dealer had told me the truth... what a gyp - the result - I had to replace the stereo.  Headlight bulbs seemed to burn out every 3,000 miles, even though the dealer could find no short or problem, not even a leak or any other justification for the constant drain on my wallet.

Comfort...there was none.  Aside from the ride, the driving position (I am 6'0&quot;) was horrible, the seats were akin to church pews and the longer the ride, the more likely I was to have leg cramps or sciatica...

Trade-in time: The truth was this - the vehicle isn't really an SUV.  In the 2WD version, it is nothing more than a cheap little car with a bad ride, poor fit and finish and abominably bad plastic and a cheap roof and interior. Trade-in value is next to nothing and you might as well fork over a little more and buy yourself something nicer or a small car, unless you are dead-set on buying on of these bone-rattlers.<br><br>
