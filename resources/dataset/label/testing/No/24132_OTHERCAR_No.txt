              In the flooring business I had until my retirement, we used several Dodge and Ford vans to haul flooring and work crews to the job sites. We usually referred to the vans by color and model. " Joe, take that wood up to the hotel in the blue Ford. Sammy, you guys follow him up there in the white Dodge." There was one van that everybody referred to by name. " Old Aches and Pains" was a 1987 Dodge six-cylinder automatic that I had bought used off a friend of my Dad's. She had sentimental value to me, but the guys at work dreaded taking her out to work. 

   " Old Ackey" was a half ton extended van that was perfect for loading a roll of carpet, tools, a carpet crew and everything needed to floor a house. She presented a very professional appearance to the outside world. Her white paint job was still in good shape with only minor rust at a few place along the bottom of the van. She only had one slight dent that I gave her when I tried to turn a corner too closely.

   The interior was sparse and functional. We had long ago taken the passenger seats out in order to convert it into a work van. All the gages were large and easy to read. I can not ever remember one giving a false reading. The radio worked fine and the air conditioner would cool down a hot and tired crew on the way back from work. The seats were just the basic seats that come as standard equipment, but they held up well with only a small amount of wear on the driver's seat.

   Where the problem came in with " Old Ackey" was with dependability. It was a pretty reliable van when I first bought it, but as time went buy "Achey" started reminding me of the old Johnny Cash song.

    <i> "I got it one piece at a time; and it didn't cost me a dime.</i>
    <i> You'll know its me when I come to your town.. </i>

   We had to replace the alternator, the voltage regulator, the battery, two universals, several hoses,the brakes, the rotors, many belts, the headlights, and the taillights. We also had to replace the engine with one from a Cordoba. ( I love what they've done to my car). In addition, the drive shaft was bent. No wonder everyone was gun shy when they had to take her out.

   On the positive side, "Achey" got from 16 to 18 miles per gallon and used little oil. And, there was plenty of room to haul supplies.

  "Old Ackey" and I parted ways when an ambitious young man that worked for us asked if we wanted to sell her. I knew he was desperate for transportation but couldn't sell the van with a clear conscience. Christmas was coming up, so I gave him the van as his Christmas bonus. I don't know whether I did him a favor or not. At least it got him to work for a couple of years.

  I've had other Dodge vans that gave me good service. And to be frank, we put our vans thru a lot of stress. Still, I think we got better service out of the Ford vans overall. My advice, if your looking for a work van would be to get the heavier Dodges or Fords.
