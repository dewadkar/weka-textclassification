            We bought this car since my husbands commutes and we didn't want to spend alot of money, big mistake if we had spent a few more thousand we could have had a great car like an Altima by Nissan.  We were lured by the 10yr/100,000 mile warranty.

Within the first two months of owning the car there was trouble with the brakes and we bought the car back to the dealer whom said there was nothing wrong with the car that there was just dirt on the brake pads.  Finally after the 4th time of bringing this car back to the dealer they realized something was wrong with the brakes and the master cyclindar.  Alas this problem was fixed only to have another problem with the Accent.  The transmission started slipping so we bought the car back to the dealer whom again said nothing was wrong with the car so we drove 1hour and 15minutes to a different Hyundai dealer.  They inspected the transmission and low and behold we needed a new transmission.  May I remind you this car was under a year old and needed a transmission already.  My husband is not a crazy driver and doesn't speed because of the profession he is in so this is no way his fault.  The dealership fixed the transmission and for 3 months the car ran great but it's November now and guess what the engine is starting to have trouble and my husband will be bringing the car back to the dealer that is over an hour's drive away and hopefully we can trade this car in in 2003.

The car is small not good for tall people.  My kids have no leg room and they are only 4 and 6 years old.  The radio is nice, the handling is ok.  The gas mileage is the only plus in this car.
