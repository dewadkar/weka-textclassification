            i bought this 92 gt because it was a great sporty looking car for the used price i paid, 7,000$ for 40,ooo miles. it was great for the first few months. then the crazy power windows got jammed up every other month. the gas milage i got was great too. i loved this car until it broke me every three months. 
   the car drives very good and smooth. very fast. a younger girl should own this ride. i was 20 at the time i bought it. it was my favorite car out of the five i've owned. older people look weird in it. they should drive a concord or intrepid.
  three times the computer chip went out, 75$ each time. gasket blown, tie rod went. i crashed this car two years later, on accident that is. i missed it very much. now i own a chevy monte carlo, great car. the accident was terrible, 8,000 $ worth damage, frame gone, door smashed, my boyfriend got thrown out the door came off, well, to get to the point, i'm fine, of course &quot; i had my seatbelt on&quot;. not a SCRATCH. WEAR YOUR SEATBELT AND YOU WILL BE SAFE IN THIS CAR. I GIVE IT 3 STARS OUT OF FIVE. GO AHEAD AND BUY IT IF YOU TRUST WHAT YOU SEE! CHECK THE BRAKES TOO, I HAD TO PUT 400 INTO IT THE WEEK AFTER I GOT IT. ABS STINKS. POWER WINDOWS TOO, AND ELECTRONIC STUFF IN THIS PONTIACS ALWAYS GO OUT. THAT I KNOW I HEAR IT FROM EVERYONE WHO OWNS A GRAND AM, I'D BUY A GRAND PRIX OVER A GRAND AM ANYDAY.. 
   WEAR YOUR BELT GUYS.....<br><br>
