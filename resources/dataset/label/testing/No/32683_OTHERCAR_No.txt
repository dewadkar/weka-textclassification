            My brother-in-laws fondness for owning Town Cars is the primary reason why his is always the vehicle of choice when we go on vacations together. Packing four sets of golf clubs, two huge suitcases and whatever other creature comforts our wives can think of poses no problem for a vehicle this large. Regardless of what negative comments  might be said about this car one could never complain about space as there�s plenty of it. 

I�ve had numerous boat like large American cars over the years and I sort of got used to or expected the type of handling characteristics that comes with the Town Car. The new model introduced in �98 has addressed some of that �float your boat� feeling offering a more stable platform than previous editions. Undoubtedly that stability comes from its smaller size, lighter weight, and better late then never suspension refinements. However the first of those changes shows up immediately in trunk space, it�s noticeably smaller. On the plus side Ford has managed to maintain the same large cabin feel of earlier models and unless you judge vehicle capacity on trunk size most people will never notice the difference. 

While there is no doubt this vehicle has more power and handles better I have mixed emotions about whether I like this redesign as well as the previous model. To me there is only two reasons why anybody would want to buy this car (Bigness and snob appeal). I suppose the snob appeal remains but the big is gone and the car just doesn�t feel the same to me. Or maybe I�ve just come to expect more out of todays automobiles.  Because when I started comparing my vehicle a �99 Chrysler Concorde to the current Town Car I found it extremely difficult to justify the difference in purchase price.

Comparing the two vehicles side by side (base models) the Chrysler gives up a tad in cabin space and trunk size. But let�s not forget the $16,000 difference in sticker price. I�d give the edge to the Town car for quietness but not by much and it certainly excels as a turnpike cruiser. However when you compare the total driving experience, in my opinion there is no comparison. The seats in the Town car lack any type of side support, acceleration is mediocre, gas mileage is so, so, handling is... well there is no handling, you just point it

When I get out of my car and start driving the Town car I feel like the Ferrari driver heading home after the races in his Land Rover. If you�re into big then this might be the car for you but you have a lot of choices in this price range, I seriously doubt the Town Car would be mine.
