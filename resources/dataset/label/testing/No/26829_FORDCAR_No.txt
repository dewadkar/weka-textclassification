               I have expressed my dislike of SUVs in many of my earlier reviews, but as long as my relatives continue to buy them, I will continue to write of my displeasure when driving them.  Ford's Expedition is now sadly a &quot;mid-size&quot; SUV despite the fact that it in itsself is a monstrosity.  The car, with its massive size offers an unwanted guarantee that it will kill the passengers of any car you come into collision with.  My closest friend's husband died in a collision with an explorer (a smaller car) and the child driving the Explorer is still emotionally wounded.  However, it still is ridiculously flimsy, and suffered $2500 of damage once in a five mph collision with a garage door.  Of course my biggest pet peeve is mpg.  This car gets a ridiculously low mpg of nearly 10 in the city.  I think it would be more environmentally sound to clear cut ten acres of rain forest then drive an Expedition around for ten years.  As usual, I have experienced another SUV and grown to hate it.  I recommend buying any car that will not waste fuel and kill passengers of other cars you may collide with.<br><br>
