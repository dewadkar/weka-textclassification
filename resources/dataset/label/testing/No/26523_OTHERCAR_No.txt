            In 1997 I bought a 1996 Chevy S-10 used, with 27,000 miles on it. At first I loved it. However, as time went on I found numerous things going wrong. I had interior trim items fall off the truck, including the arm rests on the doors. Very irritating. I also found that the S-10 does not tow as advertised. In 1998 we bought a tent trailer. The weight is within the trucks printed specs. We took the trailer on 3 weekend trips and by the end of the summer, with only about 50,000 miles on it, we spent $1200.00 for rebuilding the transmission. Last year the Heater/AC Fan stopped working. A few months ago the check engine light came on. The shop could find nothing wrong and reset the sensor. When it came on again I was told it was a faulty sensor and I had to have the sensor replaced. 

This truck has nickled and dimed me to death. I would not recommend the S-10 to anyone. GM, if your watching, you should know my experience was so bad that over the weekend we traded the truck in on a Jeep Cherokee Classic. The GM SUV's were not even considered.
