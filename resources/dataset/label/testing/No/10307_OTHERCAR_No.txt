            My husband (then, my fiance) bought this Altima from CarMax when it was about three years old. It had low mileage and looked brand-new. We were very happy with it and felt we had gotten a good deal for the price we paid, which at just over $11,000 was less than similar Hondas and Toyotas.

Now that it's getting close to 80,000 miles (and is almost paid off) we are increasingly having to put some money into it and given some of the things we don't like about it, we're considering trading it in.

Here are a list of the major complaints we have, followed by a list of things we do like.

* The glovebox is awfully designed. Having no upward tilt, it tends to dump all of its contents if you open it, so we keep maps and things in the side door pockets.
* The road noise is unbelievable. If there is anything wrong with the car (loud tires, engine noise) you're going to know it immediately. You get used to it, of course, but compared to our "nice" car, a Toyota Avalon, it feels embarrassingly loud.
* The 95 Altimas apparently have a timing chain GUIDE which tends to break and require fixing (a couple hundred bucks' worth). Of course this is out of pocket, even though this seems to me to be a design flaw and something that Nissan should at least help out with. When ours made noise I had to do research on the Internet to find out why in the world our timing chain was noisy at 70,000 miles.
* We have had to have four different oil leaks -- in different places in the oil system -- replaced over the last two years, and we change our oil every 3,000 to 4,000 miles! This gets expensive.
* To replace the struts, which we must have done this month, the rear seat has to be removed, adding to labor costs. One estimate for both struts was $460.
* The brakes squeak sometimes and no shop can ever figure out why.

What we do like:
* The car overall handles well and does have some pep to it. 
* We opted for the sunroof and it's great. You can slide a cover back and have a moonroof instead, which is a nice touch.
* It has a map light in addition to the overhead dome light.
* The dashboard (apart from the glovebox) is curvy and makes the car seem more "expensive" than it is.
* The cupholder is unobtrusive -- however, you can't plug something into the lighter (like a CD player) AND have a cup in the holder, which is bad on road trips.
* The trunk is pretty roomy for the car's size.
* The seats are quite comfortable -- and I have chronic back trouble. On road trips I use a small lumbar pillow, but that's typical.
* The interior, a light grey, is pretty easy to keep clean.
* I LOVE the pockets in the doors. Without them, storage would be almost nonexistent.

My recommendation would be that overall this car is good, but be prepared to shell out for quite a few repairs when it gets over 60,000 miles.
