            My Husband and I bought this vehicle when our second child was on the way.  The roomy back seat has made transporting two car seats very easy.  The vehicle is dependable, easy to maintain and handles well.  This is a great car in snow and handles well in almost any type of terrain.  This is the type of car that is perfect for anyone from a Bachlor to a senior citizin.  It is safe reliable affordable and looks good to boot.  The only downfall, our water pump has been replaced 2 times which was not cheap..This appears to be only this particular car as many friends and family own the same car and have not had the same problem.<br><br>
