            I bought the Olympus C2020z because of the 3X Optical Zoom. At the time, it was one of the few 2.1 megapixel digital cameras in this price range with this level of zoom. I believe zoom can make a tremendous difference in getting good shots. This camera is so easy to use. If you are a point and shoot user, with a curiousity for learning more about digital photography, this is a great camera. The thing I find most exciting is the quality of the pictures. Most photo's come out great. As with any point and shoot camera, flash shots are just OK. I am able to print photo's on my Deskjet 970cse and many people have no idea it's not a real photo. I have not experimented much with Black &amp; White. The b/w images just don't print great, but that may be the printer. The Camedia software is very basic. I only use it to download images from camera. You really need a decent image editing program to work with photos. Get a USB connection if you can afford it as the Serial connection is very slow to download images. Also, get a 32mb memory card if you don't want to be constantly deleting images off the camera. I was at a birthday party and spent too much time trying to delete missed shots to make room for more.<br><br>
