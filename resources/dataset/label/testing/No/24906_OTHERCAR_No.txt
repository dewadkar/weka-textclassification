            This past weekend, I decided to purchase a new truck.  Having recently started a new job, I figured it was time to treat myself, plus go ahead and trade in my car before it depreciated any more.  After doing some research online, before ever setting foot on a car dealership lot, I had narrowed it down to two choices:  a Nissan Frontier or a Toyota Tacoma.

I ended up buying a 2003 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 with the V6.  This review will explain why I didn&#146t buy the Nissan.  My next review will explain why I did buy the Toyota.

A couple years ago, Nissan pulled out all the stops in the redesign of their new pickups.  They added a very solid, modern look to the design, and the trucks suddenly became a very hot commodity again.  Its not like they were having problems selling them before, but they now had achieved a much more &#147cool&#148 status among buyers and truck lovers.  I&#146ve had my eye on them for quite a while, and decided to go see what they were all about.

Before looking inside the vehicle, I did a quick walk-around to see how everything looked.  I love the new front-end design.  I like the new fender design, though it looks kind of cheap up close.  I absolutely adore the new headlight design.  I love the tube rail cargo hold on top of the crew cab.  One thing I did notice which really irked me was that a lot of the visible screws looked rusty.  For example, the screw while hold the plastic grilled to the metal nerf bars looked like they had rust on them.  Perhaps they were bronzed over or it was just the color of the screw, but it <I>looked</I> rusty, and that&#146s not good on a new truck.

Once I got inside the truck, I liked the design of the dashboard and controls, and the steering wheel was very comfortable.  However, as soon as I closed the door, my legs were cramped in.  The power window and lock controls stretch the entire length of the door, and make it so that you can&#146t really rest your knee comfortably.  I am 6&#1462&#148 tall, and I was feeling pretty cramped inside this vehicle.  The center armrest was set too far back, and so was the door armrest, both adding to the cramped feeling.  In this crew cab model, they shouldn&#146t have even bothered making it a four door, because the back seats were so cramped.  Only small children could ride comfortably in the back.

I also noticed that there is a lot of wasted space in the dash area of the Frontier.  The dashboard itself is sculpted in such a way that you can&#146t put anything up there without having it slide off as soon as you start moving.  Also, at the bottom of the dash center, right above the shifter, there is a big open area that is completely useless.  It should have been made so that you could put some CD&#146s or something in there.  Like it is, you might could fit a checkbook or wallet in there, but it&#146ll most like come out as soon as you take off.

We cranked the engine, which in this model was the 3.3 liter V6, and it sounded good.  The automatic transmission shifter is located kind of low on the floor, and it was a bit awkward for me to lean down and put it into drive.  Once we got out onto the road, I found the engine to seem incredibly weak.  It did not pick up very well on the highway and the motor just roared when I tried to accelerate.  It seemed like I was in a four cylinder rather than a V6.  I was not at all impressed.

For me, the biggest flaws in this truck are the lack of ergonomics.  Although it had comfortable seats, everything else seemed cramped and out of place.  It would have been very uncomfortable for me to drive this truck for any extended period of time.  Combine lack of comfort with what seems like an underachieving engine, and I completely lost interest in the Nissan Frontier.

I left the Nissan dealer and went over to the Toyota place, where I test drove five different models and settled on a Tacoma with a bigger motor and four-wheel drive.  It was roomier, more comfortable, and cost about $2,000 less.
