            I have owned five Toyotas over the years and have had nothing but praise for any of them.  I have owned both manual and automatic transmissions, from a 72 Corolla Delux to my new 2,000 Camry LE. The Camry I bought was a replacement for my 91 Pathfinder.  I went back to the old reliable, dependable, well made Toyota.  
Since this Camry had not sold since early fall of 1999 and here it was early May, the dealer wanted to move it off the lot and made me a very decent offer.  The salesman pulled the car out of it's parking spot and I drove it down the street, around the block and back to the dealer, got out and someone pulled it into the parking spot.  Nice ride, handeld well and what could you say, it was a Toyota, &quot;Nuff said.&quot;  
 Then next morning when I attempted to back out of the parking place I had pulled into the night before I found that I could not get the car into reverse. 
I have now taken the car back to Toyota twelve times, and the bouncy &quot;General&quot; tires were replaced rather quickly with Michelins (great tires) to correct flat spots from sitting in the lot for so many months and the shift linkage was checked lubricated and an addative put into the transmission which decreased the shifting into reverse.
I stress &quot;Decreased&quot; because after nearly six months it still refuses to shift into reverse at the most inopportune times.  If it is cool weather and the car is facing downhill and up against a curb it requires great effort to get it into gear.  This is especially fun while vacationing in the mountains.  The solution is, if parked on level ground, is pull forward two or three inches and it will go into reverse with little problem.
Since this problem is intermittent and does not duplicate itself when I take it in to the service center Toyota refuses to work on it.    
I have over heard conversations that allude to the fact that other Toyota vehicles with manual transmissions seem to have similar problems.  Not most of them but still there are some of them that do.  
I have test driven another &quot;New&quot; manual shift Camry and found that the transmission was although stiff, still much easier to shift than mine was new and had absolutely had no problem shifting into reverse.  (Could be intermittent as well)
Bottom line: Toyota, where is the old customer satisfaction, dependability we used to know?  
We also own a 2,000 Toyota Solara which I sing the praises of but I cannot begin to stress enough BUYER BEWARE OF TOYOTA WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS! <br><br>
