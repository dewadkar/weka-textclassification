            We bought an S70 shortly before our first child was born. Given Volvo's reputation for safety, we felt it would be a prudent thing to do. Since the car is quite stylish and the turbo engine in our T-5 model zooms, we didn't feel we were making much of a sacrifice. That was two years ago.

Our experience to date has been decidedly mixed. On the one hand, the car looks great and feels great-- especially when the turbo propels us onto the freeway. However, we have had some notable quality lapses that, frankly, we did not expect in a $33,000 vehicle.

Within a month of getting the car, the CD player shorted out. We took it in and were assured that this was a one time problem (famous last words...). Sure enough, the problem was not fixed and we have been to the dealer four (count 'em-- 4) times for the CD player. Finally, the dealer just swapped out the entire radio/CD unit.

Next, our headlamps burned out after only 12,000 miles! When we went in to get them fixed, the mechanic informed us that this is a common problem on this model.

Most disturbingly, however, our particular model of S70 was recalled for a flaw in the electrical system that, according to the recall letter, could cause a fire while the vehicle is in use.

We certainly enjoy our Volvo, but the constant trips to the dealer to fix problems were not what we expected. On the bright side, our dealer washes the car each time we take it in, so we have had a pretty clean car these past two years.
