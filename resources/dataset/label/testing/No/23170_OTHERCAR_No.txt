            I purchased my 1995 Dodge Ram 1500 two years ago to pull a horse trailer, it was used when I purchased it.
 
This model came with 360 V8 magnum engine, automatic transmission, tilt steering, cruise control, driver side air bag, power windows and locks, heat/air, am/fm cassette player, sliding rear window, pull out cup holder in the dash, and just above the rear view mirror is a digital temperature and direction gauge. It tells you what direction you are going and what the temperature is at all times. This truck even had an extra power plug for a cell phone or whatever you wanted to plug into it.
   
I went to the local used dealer in my town and told them I needed a good truck to pull a horse trailer and work on the farm. They had shown me several trucks that day but assured me this Dodge Ram 1500 was the truck for me. I took the truck for a test drive, it handled so nice. I felt like I was riding on air in this truck. I talked to the dealer about previous owners and asked if they had any trouble with it. The dealer assured me again there were no problems with this truck.

Unfortunately, I noticed right off it had very little pulling power. It pulled great on the straight aways but had no guts to pull a hill with a trailer in tow. Then the paint started to chip and peel off around the front fenders and on the hood. Two months after I had the truck the transmission started to slip, so I had to have it replaced. The power windows quit working, had to take it to a shop and have that problem fixed. I finally got in contact with the previous owner of this truck and was informed that the transmission had been replaced in it twice. The hood latch on my Dodge Ram was faulty, it came loose and the hood flipped up and hit the windshield while I was driving it.

 
Needless to say I was very disgusted with the purchase I had made. If I had it to do all over I would not buy the 1995 Dodge Ram 1500. I do still own this truck, but I do not pull my horses with it. It does start up and run every day, i'm just waiting for the transmission to go out again. I can say that the gas mileage is not bad for a pickup, this one gets about 18-20 miles to the gallon. You have to look at the fact that if you are looking to buy a truck this size, you are looking for power not gas mileage. Please do not get pulled in by all of it's fancy features, pass it up, walk by, do not purchase this truck.
