            Yes, Yes this is not a practical review. How many people are actually reading this, in search of whether or not a new <i>Hummer</i> will be their next car??

I will go ahead and warn you if you are, this vehicle is not a smart buy.

I am being dead honest...I have a 18 year old friend that drives a 98 Hummer. I swear to you, it may sound ridiculous but it is the truth. After a few speeding incidents in his cadillac alante, his mother felt he needed something that would keep &quot;him safe&quot;. Well she certainly did get that, and then some. But what about others on the road!

The Hummer, yes as I stated in my title is for people who have more money than they know what to do with (and yes my friend is one of those people)...we were in awe that day he got it, not knowing what to expect what it would be like to ride around town in a Hummer. It was apparent early that the first thing you have to deal with in a Hummer is stares. You will notice every head on the highway do a complete 360 and follow you down the road. Some enjoy this aspect, I for one do not. People staring at the vehicle your riding in, makes me want to slouch in your seat, no matter how proud I should be. I have since gotten over this though.

The Hummer is noisy, bumpy and big. It is a liability to drive, as it barely fits on your side of the road. It is not a performance vehicle, it is diesel for crying out loud! And it is a gas hog expect to put atleast $100 a week for gas.

It's not fun to drive. Flat out. And once you do drive it (off the dealer lot that is) the price nose dives from 90,000 to about 45,000 if your lucky. This is obviously because you find out your mistake soon. These vehicles are not made for every day driving. For my friend this is his primary vehicle and he kills it. He beats it to death. It has officially &quot;died&quot; twice. The engine blew up, just from driving down the expressway.

Ohh the Hummer every mans dream...well I would not put my life savings into it. The only way I would recommend a Hummer would be if you can also afford a reliable &quot;back up&quot; vehicle, because you will need it often. Or if you have the money to only use a Hummer as an offroad vehicle, which essentially is what it is truly for. Yes it is unstopable offroad but if you get it stuck in the mud...oh boy...I'd prefer my wrangler in the woods anyday.

All in all every mans dream basically boils down to a waste of money. If you really got this much to spend how bout a top of the line Land Rover?? If you dont have a problem with the money part and this is your dream by all means, take advantage, it is a wonderful &quot;piece&quot; to show off...just dont rely on it...<br><br>
