            This car was a gift to me on my 17th birthday, when I received my license.  I absolutely LOVED it...but then again, I was in high school.  The handling was amazing, engine was surprisingly quiet, and the storage isn't as bad as you would think it was.  An avid golfer, I was able to store my clubs in the bag behind the seats.  All I had to do was remove my drivers. 

Two and a half years later:  

Let's just say that the show-off stage is over.  It's more of a pain than anything.  You have to worry about where you leave it because is LOOKS like a Porsche (a knockoff).  I drive A LOT, and being in that car for more than 3 hours at a time is torture.  You practically have to fold yourself up to get in it, and getting out is even harder.

The transmission needs to be replaced (a common problem since the tendency when driving this car is to quickly shift).  The problem will go unnoticed until you downshift into 3rd gear at a quick pace.  Also, there is this really annoying tick in the engine now but I'm really hesitant to bring it in because of the price it would take to fix it.

Also, while driving on a major interstate in New Jersey during morning rush hour traffic, the car simply quit.  One Catalytic Converter had been blocked and the other was soon to follow; both without the check engine light or any other failure light coming on.  A dangerous situation to say the least.  Not to mention, the parts were $1,000 each.

Another problem, and I must say that this is mainly my fault, but I was in an accident in the first 6 months that I got the car.  A minor accident but nonetheless it took them over 2 months to get basic parts for the car since it is so rare in the US (comparatively speaking).

Taking your car to someone to work on it is a hassle also.  Whenever I went to get new tires, they would always switch the front and rear wheels (the fronts are 6" and the backs are 6 1/2")  Most people just don't seem to understand how to work on it since they never really see one.  I had to have someone else go over it again whenever I got it home to make sure things were correct, which they hardly ever were.  

The stereo was horrible.  Within 8 or so months I had to have another one put in.  With the top down, you couldn't hear anything but rattling of the speakers. Oh, and no cruise control.  Coming home from college 9 hours one way, this is a problem.  


I drove this car as I would have any other car.  I did not treat it as if it was a $80K-$120K, because it isn't.  It's $25K.  period.  For the money it was a great car...but just because it looks expensive and has nice pickup, don't expect a Porsche, because you're buying a Toyota.  If you are going to treat it as a recreational car and not use it for EVERYTHING, then I would definitely recommend it.  Flat out...as a car...it was absolutely amazing.  Right now my car has 70,000 miles on it and it is 2 years old.  But that's all highway.  It did what it was supposed to, but as of now I am trying to get rid of it for something else.
