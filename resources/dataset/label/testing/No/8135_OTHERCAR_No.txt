            When the base price of a car hovers around the mid-$80,000 mark, its quality and performance are scrutinized by a magnifying lens.  One begins to wonder, &quot;Was it worth buying this car over 2 Corvettes at the same price, or heck, buying an Audi A4 for each of my 3 kids?&quot; Well, in my opinion, purchasing a Mercedes-Benz SL500 is not too wise in judgement.  I bought a '99 SL500 model, and the price I had to pay keeps bothering me.  Don't get me wrong though, the car is absolutely perfect-the powerful 5.0 liter, 302 horsepower engine creates neck-snapping breakaway speed and an absolutely buttery-smooth ride, but 80k for just one car doesn't seem justified.  As I mentioned before, Corvettes are amazingly affordable, and in fact, are even more powerful than the SL 500, with an amazing 345 horsepower V8 that will literally fly from 0 to 60 MPH, leaving the SL roadster trailing.  And for you image-conscious types, the Corvette will turn more heads than the SL500 ever will.  Other options to choose over the SL?  The Audi S4, Audi A6 4.2, Lexus GS400, Porsche Boxster S, and Mercedes E55 just to name a few.  All of these cars will deliver to you the same &quot;my car is faster than yours&quot; feeling as the SL does, but with MUCH more money left over in your bank account.  Trust me, unless your rich uncle left his fortune to you in his will, or if you just won the lottery, there really is no purpose in purchasing a SL500-there are so many better cars to be had.<br><br>
