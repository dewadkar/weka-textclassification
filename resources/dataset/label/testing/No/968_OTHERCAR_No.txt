            I purchased this camera in December of 1999 with high hopes. I did a LOT of reading online about this camera, everything from epinions to the manufacturer's Web page. It looked like the perfect camera for me - my requirements were a rotating lens, removable media, and good quality photos. I am an advanced beginner, I would say, when it comes to photography, so I convinced myself that I didn't need an amazing camera, just a decent one.

When I got the camera, I kept noticing disappointing features. The camera itself just feels cheap, light and fairly weak when you hold it. And it  eats batteries like crazy. I know this has been said - and I was even expecting it - but the extent still surprised me. I started a battery graveyard simply from this camera. Also, when taking a photo, after the shutter-release button is pressed, the screen will go blank, then display a message saying it is actually taking the picture, and then slowly load the picture taken. This was incredibly disappointing to me, as almost none of my photos turned out as I expected them to - the subject would almost always move in the second between when I pressed the button and when the shutter released. 

I also frequently had problems with blurry images. 

I know there is something I am missing .. another integral part of why I returned this camera and exchanged it for a Nikon Coolpix 950 .. but I cannot think of it at this time. In short, I do not recommend this camera unless you are taking pictures of still subjects. The place I bought this camera dropped the price about $100 around Christmas, and $299 does help. But if you are going to be disappointed by blurry shots, this probably isn't a good one to pick up.<br><br>
