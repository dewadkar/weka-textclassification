            My Mother-in-law bought this car new and sold it to us when it was three years old. She is very diligent about taking the car in for servicing so we were not worried when we received it. 
It was fairly reliable, was a very comfortable ride, had the luxury details that made it fun, and we had driven it for almost 200,000 miles.
The main problem areas were the brakes and wheels. The brakes constantly needed to be adjusted, brake pads needed to be replaced much too frequently, and there were annoying squeaks. 
The other major problem was the electrical system. Many times I'd load the kids into the car, turn the key, and...nothing. The battery cables were a weak point and corroded much too easily. 
The parting point for us came when the transmission started to go out. The quote we received to fix the transmission was so far over the blue book value that it was not in our best interest to keep the car. 
Since this was a model that was made in smaller numbers, the prices for parts were just outrageous. It was also often difficult to get parts since they were not easily available anymore.
