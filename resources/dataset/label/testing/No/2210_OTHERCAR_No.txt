            I purchased my 2000 Honda Prelude in March of 2001 used, with 15,000km on the odometer. I soon regretted the decision immensely.

Approximately one month after purchasing the Prelude, my transmission began to show signs of weakness. Every time I shifted from 4th to 5th gear, the transmission would grind. 

After doing some investigation, I soon discovered that Prelude's are plagued with weak transmission synchros. Even Car and Driver experienced the exact same 4th to 5th grind on their long term test vehicle (a Honda Prelude SH). My transmission was rebuilt under warranty in May 2001.

Not even two months passed until the transmission decided to show more signs of trouble. At the end of July 2001, my transmission was rebuilt AGAIN under warranty after grinding began to occur when shifting from 2nd to 3rd. 

After the second rebuild, the car behaved acceptably. A few problems did spring up, such as shocks that needed extra lubrication, but otherwise the car ran nicely. I enjoyed taking it for long cruises with my fiance in the fall of 2001, and it was a generally nice but cramped ride. After about an hour or so of driving, I get very uncomfortable (I'm 6'2"). The seats lack support and a telescoping steering wheel would make a world of difference. However, I looked passed that as the car is very nice, especially in corners and on the highway. Passing power is ample. And it looks quite sharp in my opinion.

However, the good times ended in February of 2002. Every morning on my way to work, the transmission would grind when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear. I was told by Honda that this only occurred because of the cold weather; it did in fact only happen for the first five or so minutes of driving. So instead of rebuilding the transmission again, Honda recommended that I ignore the problem as it is quite common. Apparently, many Prelude owners experience the cold grind from 1st to 2nd gear. I picked the vehicle up from the dealership and expected the problem to go away in the spring, and not cause any major problems in the future.

The transmission did in fact act better as the weather warmed up slightly. However, that was short lived. Two days ago, the transmission failed completely. I was out for a late night drive with my fiance, enjoying our early Canadian spring weather. I tried to shift from 4th to 5th gear, and the transmission grinded horribly. I tried again, making very certain that my foot was pressing the clutch pedal firmly against the floor. This time, the stick would not move into ANY gear at all. I was forced to coast to the side of the road, and shut the car off. 30 seconds later, I started the car up and tried again. I was able to engage the gears, so I put the car in reverse and made a three point turn to head back for home. I only made it to 2nd gear when the car began to vibrate horribly. I pulled off to the side of the road again, and waited two hours to for the tow truck to arrive. The car is at the dealership, again, and I am uncertain what it's future holds. 

One thing is for certain; I will never sit behind the steering wheel of another Prelude again. My transmission could have given up in the middle of an intersection during a left hand turn, or on the highway, or on a deserted road. A relatively new car should not be of such poor quality. I've owned many cars, such as a 1990 Honda Civic CX hatchback. I accumulated 480,000km on it with no serious problems aside from general wear and tear! A Prelude with 45,000km (as of now) should NOT be so unreliable. I certainly did not expect this from a manufacturer such as Honda. As I've researched over the year, these transmission problems are common (especially with automatic Preludes). I hope Honda seriously investigates these matters before they lose more life-time customers such as myself.
