            I was in the Army, Ft. Hood, Texas, when we phased out the M151A2 MUTT and the GAMAGOAT to be replaced by a single vehicle. The HUMVEE was received with mixed reviews. The CTIS system is very nice for off road, but the run flat wheels are always out of balance. The ride of the milspec version is just horrible. The suspension is way, way too stiff for recreational use. It was designed to be air dropped into hostile environments. The transfer case is a major PITA to shift into low lock. The brakes are beyond touchy. This is because the brakes are fitted near the differential out of harms way. Again great for off road but with the 2 to 1 amplification caused by the gear reduction boxes at each wheel the take a lot of getting use too. In fact, the first time I drove one, I nearly launched my passenger though the windshield. This is a specialty machine and not a civilian. Its very wide stance makes it a tight fit on most trails in our national forests without breaking a few of the tread lightly rules. If you have $50,000 plus to spend for an off road machine that will go anywhere, then look at the Land Rover Defender series, or better yet, buy a Jeep Cherokee for $22,000 and send it to a competent off road specialty shop. The Hummer will be hard pressed to beat a TJ or Cherokee with $8,000 to $10,000 worth of air locker, suspension parts, lower gears, body armor, and big tires. You will have all of the creature comforts and ride that you want with added bonus of a serious off road machine. Just 15 years of four wheeling and trail riding experience showing its arrogant head. Sorry if I offended anyone.<br><br>
