            OK, so I'll admit that the Camry is good car, of high quality, but it's no fun.  My father owns a 1996 Camry with 4-cylinder (yes, I have driven it).  It's power is pathetic.  The engine sounds like it's going to die when he accelerates onto the highway.  Not to mention that the new Camry with a 4-cyl. takes as long as a Grand Caravan to get to 60!

These cars are safe though.  My father was side-swiped by a semi when the car was only a year old, but he got out without a scratch (the car wasn't so lucky.)  Other than spending a LONG time in a shop after that, we got it back; unfortunately it has had annoying wind-noise since that.  Other than lack of power, the only complaints are that the steering hisses, and the rear windows tend to not open when they've been closed for a while.  Unfortunately, we've had the car for almost 4 years, and it already has 100,000+ on it, so it's not going to have much resale value.  Oh yeah, and one last thing that I  forgot: The seats on the generation of Camry we have are HORRIBLE (they're better now, I sat in one for a little while in a dealer).  My dad's has cloth seats, and they are not at all fun to sit in for very long.  Once while driving home from Maine in the front seat of a Camry, my back was killing me when I got home.  Also, my grandmother's Camry (also a 96) has leather, and they are the hardest seats I've ever sat on in my entire life!

The Camry's a good car if you want to get from point A to point B, but for someone who is in the market for an old big block Mustang, I hope his next car has a V-8 as an option!  I only give the car a 3 due to it's safety and good reliability<br><br>
