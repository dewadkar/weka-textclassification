            Is is just me or is the steering wheel on this thing GIGANTIC? It's like steering a codfish.

Anyway, life with Lumina has been uneventful. Like most Chevys, this is basic transportation and nothing more.

At 120,000 miles it is destructing slowly but surely. In the last 10,000 miles we have had to buy an alternator (100 bucks), a battery (50) and a exhaust gas valve (170).

Seats six but the front seat belts are attached to the freaking doors, so car seats in front (not a good plan anyway, are out.)

The dash lights flash like Studio 54 these days. 

Mileage is 15 city for this V6. Highway is about 18.

Carpets get filthy and are hard to clean. Acceleration remains peppy...the V6 is powerful but a gas sucker in the city.

Trunk is very, very roomy. You could hide the VonTrapp family in there and the Germans would still be looking.

Paint is starting to fade.

Brakes last about 20000 miles a throw.
