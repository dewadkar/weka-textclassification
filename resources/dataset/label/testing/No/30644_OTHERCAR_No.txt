               <b>T</b>he Chevy Metro/Suzuki Swift Came out in the 1980s as a 'super econobox', and surprisingly has survived all the way to the year '2001, surviving this long; despite the ridicule its owners get for owning a car in this class. The Geo had been dropped in the late 1990s, and is for the '2000 modeled year carried the Chevrolet nameplate. I still believe most of us refer to them as Geo's, even with Chevrolet's badge change. Despite the name change from Geo to Chevrolet it was not enough to save the tiny Metro from its demise.

<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

<b>M</b>y test car was a 2 door hatchback that was supposed to seat 4 people, but being a petite 5'6" I could not imagine sitting in the back seat. The Chevrolet Metro 2 door hatchback comes with a 1.0 liter SOHC 3-cylinder motor, this 55 horsepower engine is coupled with a less than smooth 5-speed manual transmission. The LSI two door, and four door both come with a 1.3 SOHC 4-cylinder engine that produces 79 horsepower. These engines can be had with 3-speed automatics or a 5-speed manual. Back to the test Car. <b>Acceleration</b> was not too bad around town, I was expecting much worse. Once this car gets into 5th gear all power is gone, flooring the gas pedal is not only inevitable, it is necessary for this car to move at freeway speeds above 70 MPH. Freeway hills are almost scary in this little car, the 55 horsepower in 5th gear can not be reached, So of course down-shifting is necessary, in 4th and 3rd the little engine strains to keep this car at 55 MPH while going up some of the steeper hills. The Chevy Metro 3-cylinder hatchback weighs around 1,900lbs, that's a lot of weight for only 55 horsepower on tap and, 58 lb-ft of torque. 

Ok now to <b>handling</b>. It handles well, but like so many little economy cars with tiny tires, you get the feeling that if you take a turn too sharp you are going to flip. Chevrolet could have improved the handling here, however producing a cheap vehicle was GM's ultimate goal in which they succeeded.

  The <b>Chevrolet Metro</b> hatchback 3-cylinder is built on a 93" wheelbase, the sedans are 15" longer and weigh about 100lbs more. <b>Suspension</b> is of strut and coil springs. The Metro comes with ABS as an option, driver and passenger air bags are standard. 


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>
   
 The <b>interior</b> of the Chevrolet Metro hatchback is 'super small', no room in the back, adequate room in front if you are less than 6.2". You can't help but fell as though you are in a little plastic go kart. The test car came with an AM/ FM stereo cassette with 4 speakers. My guess is, is this system is less than 40 watts. The drivers position is good which enable good ergonomics to the HVAC controls and the very few amenities provided. 


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

   
The <b>exterior</b> is very, well, Geo Metro looking. Sorry I really dont know what to compare it to, and lack a particular word in this case. The nose is kinda pointed, and without warning, the length of the car ends with a bubble like hatch. The Chevy Metro comes with cheap looking 13" steel wheels with hubcaps. You can have your Metro with plain paint or metalic clear coat. The exhaust pipe of course is single, and is so small at the outlet, that it's almost invisible.

<i>Price:</i>

   The <b>price</b> for this car, when test driven was 7,900 dollars, plus tax, and all those other charges. I had no intention of buying the car, I just wanted to finally drive one. Brand new, this Car was almost $9,000 dollars!!!! Hell, (excuse my french) but you can buy a slightly used Honda civic for that price. 

<i>Reliability:</i> 

Reliability for this car has had very mixed reviews. Some say they are sold as a rock, and some say they are as solid as skim milk. I can not comment personally on reliability because I don't own one of these Metro's and probably never will; not because I think I'm too good for a Chevy Metro, but because there are better cars out there for less money.
