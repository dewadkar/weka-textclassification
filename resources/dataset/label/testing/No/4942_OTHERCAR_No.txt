            This truck was given to me by my father who drove it to work for 4 years.  It is a 1990 4 cylinder.It still gets 22 mpg in town and 16 on the highway.  The only major problem I have had is that my air conditioning system started leaking after the 7th year of driving it.  I have only had to replace the starter solenoid other than normal maintenance.  Parts are easily found at any auto parts store.  I still get the quick acceleration even after my 80,000 th mile.  This truck can haul a decent amount of cargo, but you can definitely feel it slowing down.  I would not recommend buying this truck with ideas about towing anything larger than a jet ski trailer.

I have had good results with this truck other than the broken air conditioner (which will cost me $1200 if I decide to fix it)<br><br>
