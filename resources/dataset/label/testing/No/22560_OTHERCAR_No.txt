            Bought this van just one month ago. It was in good shape and had only 78K miles. After we had it only 2 weeks the transmission died, I was shocked to find out that the repair cost was $1800-$2500, and that this was a common problem with this model. The mechanics best recommendation was to get rid of it as soon as possible before it starts smoking. The van has a lot of valve noise on startup and the mechanic says this problem will only continue to get worse eventually necessitating an estimated $1000 for a valve job. Also a common problem on these vans. 
    We like the van because of it's size (smaller than most minivans), and handling (much like a small pickup), but the repair costs seem to be much higher than other minivan models or conventional sedans.
     A little research validated the mechanics opinion that these vans have a number of inherant problems, mainly the transmission and engine which are not even made by Mazda, they are Nissan, but were used in both the MPV, and some years of the Mazda 929. After fixing the transmission we tried to trade the van in and found that dealers know about these problems and offer far below wholesale price on
trade-in, we felt as if they didn't want to take the van as a trade but had to offer something to sell us a vehicle, guess they've lost money on them before too.
    Best advice: if you can't afford costly repair bills check to make sure these problems have been fixed before buying, or if you can pick on up for $2000 or less that still looks good it might be worth fixing the mechanical problems. I paid $3800 thinking I got a good deal, but the high repair costs have pushed that well over what Kelly Blue Book lists as average retail so "buy with caution".
