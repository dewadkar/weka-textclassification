            Let me start off by saying in late 1993 we bought a 1994 Mazda B3000 extended cab pickup because my husband and I both previously owned Mazdas (1987 and 1989) which we loved.  The older Mazdas, however, were both products of Mazda and not Ford.  The 1994 used 3 quarts of oil (at each oil change) between oil changes at 6,000, 9,000, 12,000 and 15,000 miles.  

Although this truck was a V-6, 3.0 I felt like I needed to have really good life insurance to pass another vehicle.  I called it my gutless wonder.  

Now I do realize that this probably was just a lemon and that others have not had this same problem.  My big problem is that Mazda would not stand behind its vehicle.  The factory representative told us it was completely normal for this vehicle to burn 3 quarts of oil between oil changes.  Needless to say we dumped the vehicle at 16,000 miles.  A very expensive lesson learned about the new Mazda. 

We still own a Mazda truck, however it is a 1986 and it has 138,000 miles on it and it is still going strong.  Could this be because it is really a Mazda and not a Ford?????????
