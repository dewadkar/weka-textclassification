            Executive Summary
Biggest disappointment in the 20 years I have ever owned a car.  It's a nice looking vehicle but reliability issues will keep you grounded.  I don't write too many of these reviews but wanted to post a warning to anyone considering the ML-series.  It is a waste of money.  I also own another Mercedes (SLK230) and do not have these problems.  There are serious build problems with the ML320 as can be evidenced by looking at epinions or caranddriver.com.

Interior
This is the strongest aspect of the ML320.  Real wood trim throughout the interior with a lot of standard features make this look classy.  Options such as 6-CD changer, Bose, heated seats, moon roof added another $4000 to the price.  Good power seats.  A lot of leg room.  I am over 6 feet tall and felt very comfortable.  Compared to the other SUVs I have owned (Pathfinder, Santa Fe, Jimmy) it is probably the roomiest.  Coolest feature is the heated seats in the winter that keep the cushion warm.  Moonroof is kind of nice as it opens all the way or tilts.  The CD changer is a bit of a pain since it&#146s located all the way in the back of the car and you need to get out in order to change CDs.

Exterior
It is a nice looking car with a bit of a mini van appearance on the hood.  Workmanship on the exterior is good.  Wheels get real dirty from the break dust.

Reliability
In the two years I have owned it, I will list the problems.  The last straw was the final problem listed below:
1.	Sunroof switch broke off in my hand.  Trip to dealer to get replaced.
2.	Seatbelt on passenger side jammed.  Wife trapped.  Not good.  Left her in there for 3 days (OK thats a joke but the seatbelt really did break).  Had this to the dealer twice and finally replaced it.
3.	Check engine light went on.  Something with the sealer on the gas cap.
4.	Windshield washer fluid reservoir cracked.  They replaced it.
5.	Moonroof shade wouldn&#146t stay open.  Every time I stepped on the break it would slide forward on its own.  Dealer said nothing they could do about it (?!?!?!)
6.	Needed breaks at 22000 miles (front) then 36000 miles (rear).  Dealer said this was normal.  By the way, each break job costs over $300.
7.	The Anti lock break warning light kept going on and deactivating the system.  Bought this in 4 times in a month to get it fixed.  They finally would up removing the steering column.  The dealer actually told me that I had 4 separate problems all contributing to the same symptom.  He must think I'm an idiot.

Additionally there are several problems I never got fixed such as occasionally the gas gauge would show half a tank when it was just filled.  Also the seat back was beginning to slightly move forward when I accelerated indicating that something was loose.  Plus more rattles than I care to mention.

Summary
So after 2 years, I traded this in for a Pathfinder LE.  You know what?  Interior is almost as nice as ML-320 just not as roomy.  The engine is more powerful and there are no rattles.  It is very reliable and it cost less than 30K.  I took an $18K loss on the ML320 and for that I will never forgive Mercedes or the dealer (Mercedes dealer in Northern NJ).
