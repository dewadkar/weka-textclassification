            I have always thought it makes far more sense to let the first owner take the big depreciation hit, so when I went looking for a pickup for my small sideline construction company I looked for a low mileage, slightly used, well equipped four wheel drive model.

The truck I finally selected is a GMC Sierra 1500 extended cab, 4X4 model with top of the line interior and equipment.

Darn nice looking and a one owner.  The seller was a young man who loved that truck and babied it, and since he was the manager of the local Quick Lube, I knew he had taken darn good care of it.  He was selling to shed a payment with a child on the way.

So the sale was made and for a while things seemed to go well.

Then one day in downtown Detroit I made the mistake of putting the driver's power window down and it wouldn't go back up.  Well folks, downtown Detroit isn't the place where you want your security devices to fail....

Finally I was able to physically pull the window back up.  I took the truck to a body shop and they opened up the inside of the door to find the power regulator assembly had failed.  So I called 1-800-GMTruck.  "Take it to a dealer for diagnosis."  Why, I asked, I already know what's wrong?  "Take it to a dealer and we'll see what can be done," was the reply.  So $72 bucks later I was told the power regulator assembly had failed....Duh.  And repairs would cost....are you sitting down....$780.00 (both driver and passenger windows were shot)

So I called 1-800-GMTruck and they said "there was nothing that can be done..." Now I'm out another $72 bucks for a diagnosis I didn't need and it's approaching a grand to fix this?  I was then told that since the truck had 70,000 miles on it I should expect some things to fail and need repairs....a freaking window?

So I wrote GMC...might as well be talking to the wall.

Then I call GMC and who returns my call?....the Global Security Department of GM.  Not Customer Service, not anybody who can help, no some Gum Shoe minimum wage dork who's checking me out because I had the temerity to complain.

Here's some advice for prospective buyers of GM products.
1.  Go to Edmunds.com and read up on your prospective purchase....had I been that smart I would have found out the windows of this vehicle suffer chronic failures...and as it turns out, there's a lot more problems with this vehicle, but go read them for yourself....I wish I had!
2.  Go to the NHTSA.gov website and see what recalls exist on your prospective purchase.
3.  Don't expect GM to do anything for you.  They tout their products as "Professional Grade."  Yeah, well we all know what the world's oldest profession is, and they're masters at practicing it.

I have a policy that has served me well for many years:  when I decide to quit dealing with a company, I always tell someone in a position of authority why.  That way they can act on the information if they decide to do so.  I did...they didn't. End of story.


In the past ten years I have owned 2 Buick Park Avenues, 1 GMC Safari Van, 1 Chevy Astro van, 1 Pontiac Grand Prix, 1 Pontiac Sunfire, 1 Chevy Celebrity, and this GMC pickup junker.  No more.  I have purchased my last General Motors vehicle. I see no reason to continue brand loyalty to a company that produces such trash and then sends some bully to interrogate and attempt to intimidate me when I complain.
