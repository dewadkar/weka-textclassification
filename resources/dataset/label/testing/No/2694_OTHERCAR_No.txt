            The Mercury Mountaineer is a great vehicle for those of us who are looking for safety, luxury, and utility along with a fashionable exterior and interior.  I'm currently leasing this vehicle because I found it to be a great car, well worth the cost.  The 2000 model witht he Luxury Package contains many positive features, including leather seats with electronic direction control, a great stereo with a subwoofer, an updated air condition/heating system, along with controls for the sound system and the air conditioning/heating systems conveniently built in to the steering wheel.  While allowing the driver to see above the traffic horizon, the SUV also drives very comfortably, absorbing shock well.  Anti-lock brakes and airbags, along with a strong body structure, create a safe environment.  Overall, I would rate this vehicle &quot;A+.&quot;  <br><br>
