            This is probably the worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever used. I know it was cheap when I bought it, but I was expecting low quality for sending quick snapshots via email or posting on a family website.

What I got was even worse.

I was astounded by how bad the pictures were. They claim 640x480 resolution, but even a cursory glance will tell you that it seems to be 320x240 blown up to 640x480.

I tried indoor pictures with moderate light. The subject looked like a blob. I went outside to see if more light would help the situation. The improvement was marginal. At least I could tell what the subject was. But these were not satisfactory enough for sending via email especially with the massive jpeg compression used.

Avoid this camera at all costs even if you're looking for a cheapie like I was.
