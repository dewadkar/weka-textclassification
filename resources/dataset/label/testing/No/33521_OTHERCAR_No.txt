            I have had the privilege/unfortunate experience to own two newer <i>Monte Carlo Z34's</i> within the past two and a half years.

This was my first brand new vehicle in my life.  My husband and I purchased a 1996 Monte Carlo Z34.  We were both very excited! My husband and I felt we were experiencing the joy of bringing home a newborn! 

The car was fresh off the transport with under 7 miles on the odometer.  We received it after a longer than expected delay due to striking plant workers. 

It didn't matter because we were so excited about getting our first new car.  It is a plush car with ample seats, even for larger people. We didn't have a sunroof to cut down the headroom.  The head room was ample for my husband, but it was a bit snug!  My husband's over 6'1" tall, and he had plenty of room, but if I hit any large bumps, he might hit his head on the ceiling!  

This car has a nice V6 engine that had decent get up and go.  The stereo was nice, nothing like a <b>Monsoon</b> stereo system, but decent for a factory model.  It did have a CD player, and AM/FM. I believe that the only choice of transmission that you can get on the <i>Monte Carlo</i> is the automatic.  So, if you were looking for the challenge of a manual transmission, this wouldn't be the car choice for you!

The <i>Monte Carlo</i> has a nice sporty look with great big leather bucket seats.  But, you could also choose a 60/40 split seat in cloth, or the 50/50 bucket-style seat in cloth.

Sounds like a pretty wonderful little sporty car, doesn't it?  Just wait.

Now is where I tell you about the disappointment.  It was as though our car was possessed. Our little <i>Monte Carlo</i> was in and out of the shop more than we drove it, it seemed. We had problem with the car dying randomly while we would drive around town.  The mechanics at the shop either couldn't recreate the problems, or blew it off as though I had no idea of what I was talking about.  They tried to get the "codes" from the computer in the car that hopefully would show them what was going on.  This only told them that there were extensive misfires that happened on two different cylinders #6 and #4, I believe. 

Then, we had to have the catalytic converter changed twice.  Why, because there was an unnerving "banging" sound coming from the back end whenever you would take off from a stop light.  They finally found out that it wasn't the catalytic converter causing the problems, but rather a bracket that they overlooked the first time.  The bracket took care of the noise.  (At least this was all under warranty!).

Then, we had carbon build-up on the oxygen sensor a couple of times too.  Then, other little problems kept occurring, but weren't able to be tracked down, let alone fixed.  We also notice paint bubbling in a couple of different areas, and the paint/body shop took it in for about 1 week to repaint that front quarter panel.  Then, another area popped up.  Enough was enough!

Needless to say, this was very upsetting.  We were paying a lot of money for a new car to reliably get us where we needed to go, and half of the time, we were having to rely on a rental vehicle from the dealership.  We checked into our state's <b>Lemon Law</b> to find out if we were covered.  Because, once the warranty ran out, I knew the repairs were going to be unbelievably high, and I didn't feel that I should have to pay monthly for repairs on a brand new vehicle!  

We contacted our Attorney General's office, received the paperwork, found that we qualified, and decided to wait for a while longer to see if the mechanics at the dealership could resolve the issues to our satisfaction! 

Well, the dealership could not fix it completely, and we weren't given any level of satisfaction that we could rely on the vehicle.  So, we filed the Lemon Law, and turned this "piece of junk" back in under our state's <i>Lemon Law</i> protection.

As a part of Chevrolet agreement to the buy-back under the <i>Lemon Law</i> was that we had to buy another Chevy. After my experiences mentioned above, needless to say, I was leary!  But, at the same time, I didn't want to keep this and continually have more problems.  I had to decide the lesser of two evils.

We chose to take another Chevy.  We did get another <i>Monte Carol Z34</i>.  It is a 1998, and we couldn't be more pleased.  We have had this one since April 1998, and we have not had any shop visits other than the normal 3,000 mile oil changes.

Love 'em, hate 'em. My verdict is still out there. Give me a while longer, and I may type another extremely favorable report!

**This review was originally posted under the 1996 Monte Carlo back in January 2000.  But, while reviewing my account today, I noticed it now said it was under the 2000 Monte Carlo's reviews.  And, I didn't want my review to be posted incorrectly! I have also updated my review, and I have included more information to back up why I did not like my the 1996 Monte Carlo.  I hope you like my review!**
