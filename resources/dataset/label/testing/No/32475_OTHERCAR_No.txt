            I have been buying Ford products for ages.  My last purchase was a 1992 Ford Thunderbird Sport.  It started showing signs of wear so I decided it was time to trade it in.  Last year I saw an ad for 1998 Chrysler products in our local paper.  The ad showed all the models in a champagne color.  I began a hot pursuit of a Champagne Chrysler Concorde LXI.  To my disappointment, I was unable to find that particular color but settled for one in a color called deep cranberry.  It is truly a beautiful car.  The inside is spacious and even a husky or long legged man can sit in the back seat in ultimate comfort. The interior design is also quite nice.  When I opened the trunk, I was (and still am) amazed by the size.  There is an abundance of room. It is a quiet driving vehicle although I still miss the 8 cylinder T-bird engine.  The engine compartment is totally 21st century, but I imagine it would be hard to work on it.  Fortunately, I take the car to the dealership and they have to deal with it.  The ONE drawback on this car is the front underside.  The design is TOO LOW in the front.  There is not a day that goes by, and no matter how slow I go into a drive, I scrape the front.  This happens 2, 3 and 4 times a day.  I cringe when I see a dip in the road or a driveway that has a slight hump in it.  I hate that.  The entire underside is scraped and becoming noticeable.  If I had to do it again, I would continue being a Ford fan.<br><br>
