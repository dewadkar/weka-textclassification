            Ok this is going to be a little biased.  When i got this car from my dad he had pretty much run this car in the ground.  It had about 180,000 miles on it and ran like, well lets just say it ran bad.  The interior was almost destroyed by him because of his job (carpenter).  He had put around 500 miles on it per week and the engine was going to die.  The oil pump wasn't working real well so I had to rev the engine above a certain number of rpm's to get it to start working.  Then the passenger side window wasn't working at all neither was the ac or the fan in the car's radiator.  The fan in the radiator was fixed by a switch that put it on full blast at all times.  So everything on this car or in it was just falling apart and my dad wasn't doing anything to help it.  So after about 9 months of this car acting this way I was driving home and about a mile from my house I heard a loud bang.  Something metal hit the road and then the car started shaking as the oil pressure gauge was going haywire.  So I got home and never drove or started the car again and about 2 months later my dad finally got it towed away to a junk yard.  From what I learned I will never take a car from a family member or ever buy an American made car EVER.  Plus this car has turned me off from power windows and made me never get a car unless it has AC.

Ok since people think that this isn't a real good opinion let me tell you this my dad buys nothing but American Cars.  I really didn't spend all that much time in this car per year only about 200 hrs or more per year.  My dad got the car and it was used from the dealership (a demo car) had about 5000 miles on it so he got it for less.  The car wasn't all that reliable from what I was hearing from my dad every so many weeks always something wrong if it wasn't  the brakes or the engine it was the computer or the transmission that was always messing up.  The only reason that he didn't get rid of it was because he didn't have good enough credit to buy one from a dealer or he didn't have a stable enough job.  Oh yeah and for those of you who don't think that imports (Japanese) cars are better my friends 86 Chevy Nova that is a Toyota Corolla lasted him nearly 300,000 miles on the original engine.  Plus many of my mothers cars where imports from Japan that lasted forever my mom only trust cars from Japan.  Oh yeah and here is one more other very trusted opinion of mine just pick up a Consumer Reports and tell me that the more than not the American car companies are horrible compared to Japanese.<br><br>
