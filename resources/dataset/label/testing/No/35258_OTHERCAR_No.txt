            <b>WARNING</b>
I'll tell you right up front that this review is not a fact sheet.  I'm not so much a picky, detail person as I am a "whole picture observer".  If you want a fact sheet, you'll have to make a trip to your new car dealership or even click on "VIEW" in this section.  Also, this identical review is a cross-reference and is listed under <b>Chevrolet</b> and <b>Dodge</b> as both vehicles are discussed and compared.  It is mainly a recount of my experience in "new car land", and I know it will serve as an aid and guide.

<b>THE DECISION</b>
I had to decide between the <b>Dodge Neon</b> and this <b>Chevrolet Cavalier</b> in my review.  See, "WHY I DID BUY IT" for my <b>Dodge Neon</b> recommendation.

<b>THE DEALERSHIP I</b>
I used to believe that first impressions were static and irreversible, but new car shopping taught me a thing or two or three.  Mr. <b>Dodge Neon</b> sales manager came on like gang busters.  Joe Salesman was about to lose my interest and I was gearing up to move on.  He sent Mr. <b>Dodge Neon</b> out to save the sale.  I didn't like him at first sight or at first hearing.  I thought, "Here's your typical "bring it on" "shark-shooter".  I, like you, was led to believe, they'll SCREW you every time.  NOT SO!  While the initial 15 minutes were negative, Mr. <b>Dodge Neon</b> won the sale.  He followed up.  He kept his promises.  He never believed he could lose the sale and he simply stayed involved.  I, in the end, made a new friend and totally scrapped my first "glimpse" of the stranger.

<b>THE DEALERSHIP II</b>
Mr. <b>Chevrolet Cavalier</b> on the other hand, was a commercial truck salesman whom I caught just before closing.  He was attentive, very helpful, and even at one point offered to bring the car to my door for a test drive. (I was carless and when my friend and I were at the dealership this salesman had no clue where the "Ad Vehicle" was.)  He took a brief financial synopsis and said he would run it through their credit check.  What a guy!  NOT!!  I had other questions, wanted to investigate other options.  He grew impatient, was rather brusque, and lost the sale.

<b>THE CAR I</b>
The <b>Neon</b> was roomy with an attractively laid out interior.  A sexy little body (my opinion) with good pickup (for a compact), comfortable seating, and an overall feeling of safety.  It felt solid.

<b>THE CAR II</b>
The <b>Cavalier's</b> exterior was quite cute.  That's all I knew about this car until I finally got to test drive it 5 days later (dealer delay).  The interior was brown paper plain (my opinion).  I felt like I was sitting on the floor.  The front seats were low and uncomfortable.  It felt like I was in a cardboard box.  I didn't feel protected.

<b>THE PRICE</b>
The price was right with both cars.  I found good deals.  In the end, it was the salesman and not the car itself that got my business.

<b>TIMING - WHEN TO BUY</b>
Finally, I want to dispel the myth that says, the best time to buy is on <b>Washington's Birthday</b> in February.  The are sales, no doubt about it, but if you want a "steal" plan to buy just before the next year's models are due to be shipped, usually June and July.  Dealers HAVE to make room.  I you wheel, they'll deal.
