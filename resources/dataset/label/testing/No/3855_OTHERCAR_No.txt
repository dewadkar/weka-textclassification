            A few weeks ago, I rented a Mercury Tracer from Enterprise Rent-A-Car. 
When they pulled up the car, I thought to myself, This car looks pretty nice. I'm glad the rental agency gave me a nice car.

Then, I drove it.

Here is my typical review for a car, starting with the short, then broken down into the Drive, Interior, and Miscellaneous comments:

The Short:
A small car that let's you know it's an econo-car every minute you're in it.

The Long:

DRIVE: To start with, this car has an incredibly large amount of engine noise. Even starting the car makes a very loud noise in the cabin. Road noise isn't too terrible, however the constant moan of the engine is probably worse than experiencing a marginal amount of road noise. The drive itself is not thrilling in the least. The car has no power. It makes noise when pressed hard, however it doesn't go anywhere. The automatic transmission shifts quite harshly, and the ride itself is quite poor. The handling abilities of this car are limited, yet the suspension gives you the ride of a more sporty car when going over bumps: harsh. There are a few positive points about the drive: visibility is good in all directions, and the controls are generally well placed. Other than that, the car is not a pleasure to drive.

INTERIOR: In a word, bad. The seats are terribly uncomfortable. After driving the car for 30 minutes, my back began to hurt. The interior materials felt quite cheap, and the lack of a center-armrest was not a welcome experience. The shifter for the transmission is very tall and looks extraordinarily cheap. There is no rear-window defroster in the standard model, and there is also no tape-player. The outside rear-view mirrors are adjusted by opening the window and moving it with your hand. A few personal dislikes of mine include the lack of a tachometer and the oval in which the climate controls and radio are placed. This way, there is no real way to replace the very low quality factory radio. The advantage to the interior is that there is a sufficient amount of leg room for a tall person.

MISC: I find the car to be decent looking at first glance, but once you get to know the car, it is significantly less attractive. I think there are much better cars out there for the same price. <br><br>
