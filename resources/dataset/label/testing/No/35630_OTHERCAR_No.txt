            I bought my 1998 Chevrolet Malibu new to replace a 9 year old family vehicle.  We keep our cars as long as we can, so we usually make sure it's a purchase we can live with for awhile.  I like everything about the car, EXCEPT the brakes!!  Every 6 months I have to have the brake pads rotated so it will brake smoothly.  Otherwise, it shudders to a stop.  I've mentioned this to my dealer and am told this is a common problem in Malibu's!!  Had I known that, I would not have made this purchase.  The car has lots of pep, which I like, and gets good gas mileage.  I also like the nice deep trunk and the CD player which is standard on the base model.  It's a good family car for the city, but I wouldn't want to go on a long trip in it as I would definitely be cramped.  I would recommend this car for a college student or a small family.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone needing lots of leg room.<br><br>
