                     I have had considerable experience with a Pontiac Sunfire SE coupe. Fortunately I did not have the misfortune of owning one myself. However, I feel for the poor souls who do have had to actually open their wallets for this piece of molded tupperware. Where to begin...I hated actually having to exert force to get into this car.
     
         The first thing I can say about this car is that the performance is shamefully disgraceful, if you have an automatic transmission in this car, you are in even worse shape. Step on the pedal at any RPM and you will be stuck 'waiting' for something to happen. The steering in the car is equally bad. My wife's 91 Toyota Previa with alignment problems didn't feel much different. There is NO feedback while turning. It handles awfully. The oversteer in this car will blow your mind. I find it amazing how GM found a way to put such a HORRIBLY handling car on such a short wheelbase. Good luck taking this car to an autocross. I am quite certain GM would have saved money had the NOT implemented an UN-limited slip differential on the car, which is the only way to explain this cars God-awful handling. All you need to do is take a corner properly, the car bites off more than it can chew, and BOOM, full body roll. Only one way to fully exploit one of this cars' many weaknesses... The only possible way for the owner to get performance out of this enigma of a 4 cylinder 1.3 14.1:1 17 second 1/4 mi. lawnmower is to pump it full of aftermarket modifications. With the amount of money you will shovel out for worthless add-ons to this poor car, you might as well buy a Honda. 
   
        Don't care about performance? Well your definitely not in for a treat when it comes to being a head-turner. If they do turn their heads, it will only be to laugh at it before getting involuntary dry heaves. The only one word analogy for this car would be to say that it looks like an 'egg.' What moron slipped through security and drew up the blueprints to this car? There are absolutely no proportions to this car at all. My 2 year old son could have drawn up a nicer looking car than this on his finger painting slate. The spoiler, which when clean, may be removed and used to serve food, is an afterthought. One can tell the manufacturers were contemplating whether or not to include it at all. I'm afraid they made the wrong choice. An over-exaggerated front lip cowls out beyond its means to serve no end. The rear lights look like a psychologist's foiled ink-blot test. Pontiac does have it's share of styling blunders i.e. the Aztec, but for the people who love to hate cars, I'm sure they were raving like madmen when this car was shoved off the assembly line. 

         The visibility is atrocious, blind spots, a letter box opening that passes for the rear window, a hood which aids with poor judgment for distances and proportions, and super high tech spring mounted side mirrors that are dwarfed by the insanely fat, bulky, "rolly-polie" look of the car.
       
         The interior looks like GM hasn't changed its concepts about comfort in...oh say EVER! The cloth seats are hideous, the air vents and cockpit controls look 'lost' in the fact that they are moderately decent and look like they are in the wrong car. Window handles...oh did I neglect to mention that it didn't have power ANYTHING? Excuse me, I should have. This car doesn't have power ANYTHING. Even the engine is operated by a mouse-wheel, push the gas pedal and the cheese is lowered. But I digress... The window handles come off when manipulated the wrong way, the dashboard is oversized, and on hot days, feels like silly putty. The oversized steering wheel tops it off with its impracticality.
      
        The gas mileage isn't even that good for a 4 cylinder car. But not this. There's not many mechanical problems that plague this car but that's unfortunate for the owner. If I were the owner I'd much rather have this car in the shop that be seen in it.

          There are many other cars in this class that would be GLAD to oblige to you. If you feel like pumping ANY amount of dollars into this car to 'get rid' or 'fix' its countless list of insecurities, stop yourself, and ask yourself why? Yes there are a number of them on the road today, but only occupied by poor disillusioned souls with no concept of what a good automobile is.
