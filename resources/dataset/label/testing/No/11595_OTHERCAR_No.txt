            I have test driven all makes and models of suv's.  My evaluation on them all is interesting.  I first drove the toyota 4 runner, it was not roomy enough on the inside.  If you are a small person, this may work for you.  I am about 6 foot 200 pounds.  When i drove the ford explorer, it was a good vehicle but the inside was too small again.  My last vehicle i drove was the Isuzu Rodeo.
This vehicle was great for room.  There is plenty of head room as well as leg room.  I was able to sit comfortably in the seat without feeling crammed.  It comes with many features including to different size cup holders that you can use.  If you drink the 1 liter bottles, this cup holder will it perfect.  The main controls are in reach without having to stretch accross the vehicle.  I then sat in the back seat and found it to be very roomy.  My legs fit without my knees coming near the front seats.  This vehicle is a must to test before you buy.  The only problem I found with this suv is the noise.  It is a little loud, but manageable to handle.<br><br>
