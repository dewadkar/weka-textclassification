            My girlfriend and I were looking for a new car to replace her aging 1991 Mercury Tracer a few weeks ago. One of the cars we considered was the Plymouth Breeze. The Plymouth Breeze is a fairly attractive car at a very attractive price, (around $14,000). Unfortunately, Daimler-Chrysler has decided to cast Plymouth adrift and the dealership we visited had no Plymouths for us to look at. In its place was a stripped down version of the Chrysler Cirrus - the LX.

I once owned a Chrysler - a 1985 Fifth Avenue - an excellent car which is still faithfully serving my brother and his wife several years after I sold it to them. I thought we should seriously consider the Cirrus. Unfortunately, this lesser Cirrus sure looked like a base car with its tacky plastic wheel covers doing a poor masquerade of more expensive cast aluminum wheels and ugly cloth interior. Chrysler alone is not the only manufacturer whose base models have these two awful features. I've seen those cheap wheel covers and the ugly fabric used in all cars ranging from the Kia Sephia to the Toyota Camry. Do manufacturers deliberately use these features to sway potential buyers away from their base models toward the more deluxe ones? I recall a time when even base models still looked reasonably nice. My father's 1961 Chevrolet Biscayne was still an attractive car despite its Plain Jane status.

The car we looked at was the upscale Cirrus LXi priced at $21,000. It was a dark green metallic with tan leather interior and cast aluminum wheels. The Cirrus is not a very big car. It's sort of like a stretched Neon without the Neon's plebian image. I liked the Plymouth Breeze's &quot;eggcrate&quot; grille more than the Cirrus' mesh one. Older Cirruses have a nicer vertical grille. The car we looked at had the 2.5 liter V-6 in place of the 2.4 liter four, but I found it rather unnerving that the
V-6 was made by Mitsubishi. 

Our experience with the dealership was pleasant. The salesman was very accommodating and willing to answer all our questions about the Cirrus. The .9% financing that was available made the purchase of a Cirrus attractive.

I could tell that my girlfriend wasn't too impressed with the Cirrus. She had been more enthusiastic when we test-drove other cars, (Chevrolet Impala, Toyota Camry, Honda Accord) but insisted that just I drive the Cirrus. The first thing we noticed was the car was rather cramped. The air conditioner took a long time to cool the interior despite the lengthy drive we took. The other cars cooled rapidly. The radio reception wasn't too good either. I did like the sporty instrument cluster with its round gauges and the slick shifter console. The car handled and braked well. The 2.5 liter V-6 didn't seem as peppy as I expected.

The more and more I drove this car, the more it reminded me of the type of car my 61 year-old father would drive. The Cirrus would probably make a great car for an older person who's interested in a smaller car, but it didn't do much for me. It's a shame. I really wanted to like the Cirrus, but I walked away disappointed. It seems you can get more for the same price or a little more with the other cars.  The Cirrus LXi probably would be a more attractive car at a lesser price. Bring back Plymouth and bring back the Breeze!<br><br>
