            I knew I wanted a wagon and really shopped around.  The positive aspects I had read about the car are certainly true.  It's a great looking car with a smooth ride.  I bought the 1.8L turbo and it is peppy!  I love turning on the lights at night as the interior is great looking. I love the options, like the dimming interior light, the keyless entry, and all the window washer speeds. It's been a lot of fun to drive.

There are also some things VW should work on in the future.  There is not much room around the driver to hold CDs, sunglasses, maps, whatever.  The center armrest is small.  The space behind the shifter is only good for loose change.  The map holders aren't that big and there are not rear cupholders. I need more room to hold my stuff! Also, I expected the gas mileage to be better.  I am not an aggressive driver and was surprised that I could watch the needle move on the gas gauge just driving 10 miles to work. I wish it was more economical.

Lastly, I have to report, that although my car only has 1300 miles on it, it broke down on me as I was traveling a major highway. It started shaking and jerking.  I thought the alternator was going and managed to get my new crippled car almost home before it completely died.  I was towed to the dealer and it has been there for a week.  The service shop told me it needs a new $900 control module, but when they put the part in, the car is still not working properly. I am obviously very concerned that my new car is having issues of this nature.  Keep this in mind when you make your purchase decisions!
