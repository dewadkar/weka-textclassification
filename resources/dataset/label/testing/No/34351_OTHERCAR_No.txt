                 I bought my 1990 Corrado G60 to be an inexpensive sporty "reliable" daily driver.  Unfortunately I neglected to research the car's reliability.  I'm told that Corrado means "to run" in Spanish and that is exactly what you should do with this car (run away) unless you're prepared for the mechanical nightmares that accompany it.

     First the good news.  On the outside the Corrado is a sharp looking car.  It has a clean, sporty appearance that is a credit to its designers.  Even before I knew what a 
Corrado was, when I passed by one it always caught my attention.  I was also surprised to find that the Corrado has a speed actuated rear spoiler (much like the 3000GT VR-4 I previously owned).  Though much more subtle than the spoiler on the 3000GT I would still occasionally catch the driver of a nearby car straining their neck to watch the spoiler descend at a stop light.

     The Corrado also has a very smart interior.  The leather seats are supportive and comfortable (the dual heated seats are a nice touch) and everything is easy to reach and operate.  The rear seating and luggage capacity are about what one would expect from a compact car.  The power moon-roof works well and didn't leak.

     The Corrado is surprisingly fun to drive.  It's 1.8L supercharged engine revs eagerly.  While not blisteringly fast by any stretch of the imagination the Corrado's acceleration is enough to match many of the sport compacts running around today.  If the Corrado's stock performance isn't enough for you, there is a small aftermarket following.  My '90 Corrado came modified with a few aftermarket goodies (chip, intake, exhaust, and smaller supercharger pulley).  These few modifications were more than enough to surprise a few of the local Honda Civics.  For better or for worse the Corrado is front-wheel-drive and shares all of the benefits and disadvantages of front-wheel-drive.  The Corrado's handling is impressive for a sport compact.  It exhibits the typical mild understeer of a front-wheel-drive car, but is also remarkably nimble.  The Corrado's fuel economy isn't all that good for it's size.  It's rated at 21 MPG city and 28 MPG on the highway.  I saw probably closer to 17 city and 25 highway.
     Pleasantries aside, the Corrado is one of the biggest mechanical nightmares to come out of Germany.  The stock 60mm "G-Lader" supercharger self-destructs approximately every 70,000 to 80,000 miles and replacing or rebuilding it is prohibitively expensive.  Second, the engines (both the 1.8 and the VR6) are known to develop problems.  The Corrado's design also appears to be such that it is extremely labor intensive to work on.  For example on one ill-fated night after a bit of spirited driving a plastic crosspiece in my shifter broke.  The repair bill came to over $400.  In order to reach the affected part, the mechanic had to drop the exhaust in order to get at the shifter mechanism (it wasn't possible to get at it from the top).  After I had owned my Corrado a few months I attended a Corrado-owners get together.  When asked why I bought my Corrado I responded that "I wanted a sporty, reliable daily driver" the other owners laughed at me and clued me into all of the other things that would soon break on my car.  It was at that time that I decided the Corrado wasn't the car I thought it was.  As I soon found out the Corrado's overall design was full of flaws, as many of the owner-enthusiasts know.  While the car was twelve years old when I bought it, it was in very good condition for it's age.

     To sum everything up, the Corrado is an enthusiast's car.  The people that own them for any length of time generally know what they have gotten themselves into.  If you are willing to put up with the mechanical problems the Corrado is enjoyable to drive.  If you're set on buying a Corrado and plan on doing a major rework of the driveline, pick up an earlier G60 as there are aftermarket turbo and supercharger kits that do away with the problematic G60 supercharger.  If you aren't planning on this much work, I'd recommend buying one of the second generation (1992 to 1994) Corrado VR6s.  While the VR6 version still has it's problems, it has more horsepower and is marginally more reliable than the G60 version.
