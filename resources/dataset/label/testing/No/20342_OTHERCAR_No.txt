            I have loved the body style, engine and Nissan in general, which is why I chose the 1996 Altima. I received the car with about 80k miles on it. I know Nissans are good for around 200k, so I thought. The car has already been to the shop for motormounts and other mechanical issues. My car hit 102k miles one evening, as I was driving down the freeway. I heard a pop, some stutters and some other weird noises and I slowed down to a stop. I took it to a mechanic of mine who had the same vehicle, he check his out to find a thrown rod ar 92k miles. Guess what he found in mine. A rod was thrown, tore up a lot of stuff in the process to. I did some research and found that others had the same issue. Now, I'm 19 with a 5000 dollar loan and a broken car. Also, there are other weird noises coming from the engine bay. Well that's my story.
