            <b>JVC GC-QX3HD</b> is a camera I <b>Love and Hate</b>.  

<b>Main Features:</b>  7.5-17.5 mm motorized Zoom Lens (F2.8/3.8,5.6,8,11), Flash, Manual Mode, Video Mode, Still Mode.  The camera also has a Video/HD output, Printer Output, USB digital output, and a DC Input for use without a battery.  2" LCD Screen, Shoot Standby Light, Battery Strength Indicator, Lock Button, Mode Select Dial, Iris Button, Focus button, Flash Button, Self Timer Button, Exposure Control Button, Directional Button, Execute Button, and if that doesn't confuse you, then maybe this camera <b>is</b> just right for you.

<b>Using The JVC</b>
  As the Features above note, there is definately a lot packed into this little half pound camera, and the quality of the finished product is great, but getting there requires a bit of studying, and memorizing of the almost hundred pages of information that accompanies the technology.  The Camera boasts three quality of photos <b>(Standard, Fine, and No Comparison)</b> and depending on which setting and image size you choose, the memory card will hold from 3 to 87 photos.  The simplest is to take normal stills inside or outdoors, which really only requires turning the mode knob from the "Off" position to the "A", or automatic position.  Simply point, press the shutter button halfway until the light in the lens stops flashing and take the picture.  Immediately after, for a second or two, your finished photo will appear in the 2" LCD.  Anything short of that requires switching modes, using the zoom selector, or the several "manual" adjusting capabilities offered as listed above.  For my first purchase of a "higher quality" digital camera, I must admit I was shocked at the many steps involved in it's use, as well as the many different cords and adapters you have to have in tow if you are planning a major photography session. 

<b>Video Mode:</b>
  The camera also has the interesting and great added capability of shooting a 160 X 120 pixel 20 second video clip which can be difficultly transferred from the camera onto your home PC with the USB connection (which by the way sucks the battery dry within a very short time).  Almost every time I have the Camera hooked up to my PC for transferring photos over, my Camera battery goes dead while I'm in the middle of my project, which forces you to either quit until you recharge, or haul out the charger, with the DC power cord, and plug the whole thing into a 110AC connection.  <b>VERY</b>aggrevating!

<b>Included in your Purchase</b>
  Are a battery charger/Adapter, a battery, HD Video cable, one memory card, a Video Cable, a DC cable, and a USB Driver on CD ROM.  

The <b>JVC GC-QX3HD</b>is also capable of printing directly to a printer, with the purchase of an "optional" cable.  Macro Shots for distances of up to 2cm can also be taken in Auto, Manual, or Video Mode, by pressing a button on the Camera top.  Photo numbers, and dates can be imprinted on each photo, or removed, and special effects such as taking B&W shots are also available once again if you read and remember well!

Finally, I find it very difficult to properly rate this camera to give it it's honest ranking in the stars!  The camera is fairly good weight, just over 8 ounces, and attractive enough.  Feature wise it's a Gem.  The problem is I think the design department could have done a lot better and cut down on the need to read and absorb so many little things to get a good quality image out the back door.  Hopefully JVC's next try will be a real winner.
