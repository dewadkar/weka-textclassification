            It's a good car, a great concept, and a faulty execution:
Okay, it has a lot more room than one should expect in a compact design. It probably saves more gas than it uses, and it is light years ahead of its predecessor in style and design.
Yet, it has some true flaws:
1.NVH - noise vibration and harshness - come on guys, compare this to the Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic - it needs a more refined engine.
2. Manual transmission - if a 4 cyl engine is going to properly perform, it needs to marry its transmission, not just shack up in a drunken stupor for the evening. The stick shift on this car is baulky, with a heavy feel and a lack of convincing precision. Once again - learn from Honda and Toyota.
Insufficient road isolation - understandably, it's a small 4 cyl car - yeat more could be done to make it more than a 2 hour drive. I wouldn't want to do the cross-country thing with it.
