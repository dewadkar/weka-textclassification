            Anything positive said about this car by other epinionators is probably well-deserved. And I share that appreciation; after all, I bought the car and owned it for 36 hours. It seems truly amazing that for just under $11,000 (including $500 rebate) anyone can get this much content in a 2002 4-door sedan (the hatchback is $100 less and comes with a rear wiper, but the 4-door is the deal). Fit and finish are satisfying, the paint choices tasty, and the features--unbelievable.

That sub-$11,000 price included air, auto, the larger engine, power windows, locks, and mirrors, auto-off rear defroster, intermittent wipers, fully-adjustable driver's seat with adjustable lumbar support (ah), even an FM CD stereo with 6x9s in the back, 5-inchers in the front, and (for crying out loud) tweeters mounted on the sail panels!

And so I took it home and got it out on the road. The steering is precise and the engine is smooth around town when not pushed, and cruising in the defeatable overdrive gear is no biggie even at 80 MPH. Brakes are unspectacular, to be charitable. Visibility is the best I've ever experienced. You can see as much as if you were sitting in the middle of your lane in a metal folding chair.

And then I figured I'd deliberately do something I inadvertently do all the time--overcook my speed into an off-ramp a tad, then drop the gas, whack the brakes, and correct the steering as needed. The tires acted like jelly donuts and the car slithered as the suspension flat freaked and the body rolled like the Alpengeist. If the seats hadn't been covered with porous cloth, I'd have sucked a couple yards of vinyl. I'm still surprised it didn't flip.

That was enough to negate all my positive impressions. What would it do when a sudden swerve were called for in traffic on a rainy street? There are only three ways to get out of trouble: steer your way out of it (not with this uncontrollable suspension), power your way out of it (no way with 105 horses less 8% due to the automatic) and brake your way out (not a chance with this car).

If I got into a tight, I was convinced my chances of making it out unscathed were minimal. Factor in the poor crash statistics at www.hwysafety.org and, well, you get the picture. Younger folks going for their first car probably don't think they'll ever crash or ever be put in an impossible spot by another driver. I'm old enough that I knew instantly what that combination of squirmy tires, body roll, weak engine and brakes, and tiny size inevitably spelled for me.

So even though the Accent had taken me almost $1,000 over my $10,000 target (yeah, I'm cheap), the next business day I returned it under the dealer's 7-day trade-up clause for a leftover 2001 Elantra at $2,000 more ($3,000 over my budget). The Elantra's crash stats are almost as bad as the Accent's, but at least it's got acceptable suspension, a freshly-improved 2.0-liter motor, Michelins, and optional ABS brakes and traction control to give me a shot at dodging trouble when it comes. Take a cheapskate's word for it: sometimes cheap is far too expensive to bear consideration.
