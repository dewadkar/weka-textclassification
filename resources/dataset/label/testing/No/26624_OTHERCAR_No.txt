            In this review you'll find my personal experiences.  By now you've probably seen the statistics, so I won't bother repeating them.

  I initially had a 2001 Ford Escape, but after a rollover I decided I needed something safer.  The 2002 Honda Accord SE maxed out all the safety requirements.  Before purchasing it I spent a tremendous amount of time researching it and other cars.  I used Consumer Reports, Kelly Blue Book online, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration site.  It is www.NHTSA.com.  
     This car is SAFE!  The risk of rollover is almost nil.  Driver and passenger safety on impact is great.

     The price of the Honda was slightly higher than other comparable cars in its class.  I think your paying for the reputation of resale value and reliability.  The warranty is 3 years or 36,000.  Not so great compared to what everyone else was offering.  I drive over 12,000 miles a year so I added an extended warranty package.  I also added a clear coat and interior protectant package.  It didn't come with window tinting, so I added that. All this increased the price of the car by about $2000-2500.

     After almost a year, the surface has many whorls and scratches.  I don't know if the exterior clear coat helped at all.  I am about to investigate that warranty.  The interior stain-resistant package seems ok.  The car mats were protected, but they are not included in the warranty.  Just weeks after I got the car, I spilled chili on the floor mat and the stain wouldn't come out.

     The SE or Special Edition falls in between the EX and the LX.  It has a sun roof and wood-grain interior accents, alloy wheels, not wheel covers.  It is a 4-cylinder not a V-6.  The power is ok, not great.  I often find when I am speeding up for highway driving that the car hesitates.  The gas tank holds about 17 gallons.  The gas mileage is satisfactory but not impressive.  I'm getting about 22-24 MPG.  The 2002 Accord series is larger than previous years.  

     My big area of dis-satisfaction is with the comfort level.  The little things are adding up.  The cup holders don't hold larger drinks or mugs.  If you have two drinks they squeeze against each other, making it akward to remove and replace them.  I am a tall person and I can't seem to adjust the steering wheel and seat distance to be comfortable.  It is always just a little bit of a strain.  I wish the steering wheel was about an inch further out of the dash.  I either have to have my legs slightly too far from the pedals or the wheel to close to my chest and my arms in an uncomfortable position.  The height adjustment on the seat is inadequate.  There is no lumbar support or adjustment.  Individually these things are insignificant, but together they add up.  The longer the drive, the more noticable the discomfort level is.  It is for this reason that I will be trading the car as soon as I can.

     Overall the 2002 Honda SE is a satisfactory car.  It as no pizazz.  I have only seen the SE in fire pepper red.  It is a pinkish red.  In some light the car looks more pink than red.  Also it seems that there are a lot of these cars running around, all the same color.

    I personally would not recommend the car because of its comfort level.  If you are considering this car, pay close attention to this.  Don't assume that you will get used to it.  It has a lot of great features, but if you can't get comfortable then those things become less important.
