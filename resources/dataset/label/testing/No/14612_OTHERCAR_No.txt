            I test drove this because I was sent an offer that if I did I would receive a free pair of Teva Hiking Boots. As a Hiker in need of a new pair of boots, I couldn't pass this offer up. 

The Freelander is the next Defender. The Defender is known all over the world as one of the best off-road vehicles ever created. Can the Freelander fill the Defender's shoes? 

My first impression of the Freelander is that I don't like the rake of the hood. I know that it increases visibility and is a good idea, but it just doesn't flow when I look at it. 

<b>Power:</b> The Freelander had ample power for such a small 'ute. The 174 hp isn't bad, but I wonder if it will have a problem selling in the current market with horsepower wars against all the SUV manufacturers. Even the Ford Escape has 200 hp. And Ford owns Land Rover! 

Torque 177 lb-ft was good, too. It took off the line really well and I think highway passing would be easy. I did not get to take this on the freeway, but I wasn't test driving to buy anyway. 

The transmission shifted smooth and when needed. Too many vehicles you find get shifty and confused. This one was fine. 

<b>Interior:</b> The interior is really nice in this 'ute. The seats were comfortable, and I especially liked the storage area at the driver's knees. The fit and finish of the materials was expectant of a Land Rover at $28K. Compared to other 'utes in this market, I would say this is one of the better ones. Headroom was ample for my 6'0 frame. 

<b>Cargo:</b> Not much cargo area at all. Of course, considering how small this vehicle is, it's expected. I looked all over the website for the numbers (cubic feet) of the cargo area, but I couldn't find it. I guess it's nothing to brag about. I will say that this 'ute is too small for us. 

<b>Options:</b> Though, Land Rover offers a ton of accessories for outfitting your Freelander there are three trim levels are available:  the S, SE and HSE. Standard equipment on the S includes power windows and central locks, air conditioning, remote keyless entry with theft alarm, a CD player and cloth upholstery. SE has leather trim, 17-inch wheels, cargo cover, roof rails and steering wheel-mounted stereo controls. The top-of-the-line HSE receives a power sunroof, an in-dash six-disc CD player and a nonintuitive navigation system. Heated seats are an option on all trim levels. All trim level information came from http://www.edmunds.com.

<b>Overall:</b> My major worry about this vehicle is the quality. Land Rover has always had a quality problem and it's pretty well known. Used Range Rovers, their flagship, take a major hit in resell value. I can only imagine what this much cheaper vehicle will do. I guess I'll just have to wait and see. 

Because of my quality concerns, I cannot recommend this vehicle yet. I may change my mind after a couple of years, but the vehicle is just too new. 

I wish I could narrow down the quality problems that Land Rovers have had, but I can't.  It seems to me that if something could go wrong on a vehicle, it has on a Land Rover.  I wish it was just one thing!

<b>Interesting Tidbit:</b> When I was at the dealer I got to see Val Kilmer's Discovery. Apparently one of his aids(?) offered to change the oil in it, and only put 5 quarts in. I was told that the Discovery takes 7 quarts and now, Mr. Kilmer needs a new engine. Ouch! At least he can afford it.
