                 Unfortunately, I'd have to say our 1994 Olds Cutlass Supreme sedan is a dog. We bought it new as a family sedan, and in the last couple of years it has given us more than its share of troubles. Even before then, there were lots of factory recalls which we should have recognized as a warning. 

     To be fair, the car has only stranded us twice. The vast majority of the problems are little annoying things like the turn signal refusing to blink, power locks and windows failing, third brake light falling off, that kind of thing. However, you will also face frequent brake jobs, and ABS system problems, both of which will really drain your wallet.
    
     In its favor, the driving experience isn't bad. It's roomy and very quiet inside, and very relaxed on the freeway. There's decent power with the 3.1 V6 and the transmission is very smooth-shifting. It's still not especially fun to drive, though, because the steering is too light and the big pillars and low driving position make the visibility poor. It comes with lots of standard electric toys like power windows and locks, but you can bet these will stop working at some point. Many interior materials look and feel disappointingly cheap. In addition, the underhood area is inconveniently designed, so it's hard to do your own work, and parts are very expensive.

     I guess you could do worse for cheap family transportation, but I would personally recommend you avoid this model, especially the 1994 which is supposed to be particularly unreliable. It may be a cheap purchase, but it'll cost you an arm and a leg to keep it running well. <br><br>
