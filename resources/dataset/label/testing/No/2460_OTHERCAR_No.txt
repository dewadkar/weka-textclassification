            We bought our '99 Cherokee Sport in August of 1999.  It was a four-door, 2WD model.  The power developed by the 4.0L 6 cylinder was great.  However, I would not recommend this vehicle over a mini-van as a people mover, save for the fact that the towing capacity is 5,000lbs.  The vehicle rides very rough and is somewhat hard to get into and out of.  The back doors are particularly narrow, and loading a baby seat back there was an exercise in madness.  We had no mechanical problems with the vehicle whatsoever, and that's alot to be said with power everything on the vehicle.  The seats were uncomfortable, and the suspension is very stiff.  Like I said, if you want to use the vehicle for towing, that is fine.  We traded the Jeep in on a '99 Caravan Sport, and we just love our new van.  It is far more comfortable, economical, and roomy.
