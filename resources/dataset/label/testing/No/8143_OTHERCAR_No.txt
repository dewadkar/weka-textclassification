            My wife, who is a photographer, recieved this camera as a gift. She was in no hurry to use it. She see's digital photography as &quot;cheating&quot;. She is, I suppose, an old fashioned sort; she enjoys developing her film, and making prints in the small darkroom we have set up in our home.

It was left to me to try this camera out.

The design of this device is attractive, as well as being built with ergonomics in mind. It fits comfortably in the hands, and the controls are easy to work.

The camera has an LCD screen, which serves as a viewfinder. This set up takes some getting used to, but after awhile is quite nice.
The camera's built in flash is very bright. It seems that this camera requires a huge amount of light to create an image, which surprised me. I would have thought that digital cameras would function well in low light situations.

The image quality is slightly less stunning than I expected, nowhere near as sharp and clear as film. In fact every picture seems to be all grain, and soft edges.

The software that is included with the camera is alright, but really not very impressive. It seems to be mostly designed for doing things such as putting your head on a Barbie doll.

Don't misunderstand, I don't see this camera as all bad. I think that for the unexperienced photographer who only wants convenience, and ease of use this may be a great toy. It is not, however, a camera for those who are serious about photography either as hobby or vocation.

Perhaps my mind will be changed about digital cameras when I have occaision to use a higher end product, but so far I agree with my wife: Film is the only way to go.<br><br>
