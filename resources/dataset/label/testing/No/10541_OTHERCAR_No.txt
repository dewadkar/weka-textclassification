            We bought this vehicle for the space and flexible seating.  Also, it can carry a full 8' x 4&quot; sheet of plywood, but strangely enough I have yet to do that.  Unfortunately, at 35,000 miles it is already showing signs of a typical American car (the car I replaced with this Voyager was a 1985 Toyota Tercel that was running strong with 140,000 miles).  Here are the things that bother me:

- big thumping sound in back (related to gas tank I think)
- Rattles after less than 10,000 miles
- windshield wipers often come on when I use turn signal (fortunately they turn off by themselves when this happens)
- the accessory fan belt has always been a little too loose, which sometimes affects power steering
- water pump is leaking
- air conditioner is making weird noises like fluid under pressure then depressuring, and the A/C performance is not what it used to be
- the battery broke (yes it was THAT sudden!) within 3 months of purchase, covered by warranty but still who needs the hassle?
- two recalls, where they also reported that I needed brake work

I bought this Chrysler product instead of Toyota to save some money plus I had heard that American cars were showing good reliability.  I think after this experience I may try my luck with Japanese again and pay the money.  I cannot really recommend this car to friends and relatives at this point - I like the features of the interior design a lot, but I guess you have to be pretty lucky to get a trouble-free car.  I really don't like dealing with repairs and doing without a car while it's in the shop.
