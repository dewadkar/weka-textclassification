            The 900 SE (Turbo Convertible) is a fun car to drive, with great acceleration and a HUGE backseat for a convertible. I have sat in the back without a problem, but I usually have my two children back there in carseats. However, my car had plenty of glitches that were a hassle to get fixed.

First, the CD player didn't work an hour after I bought it. That took a drive back to the dealer, an hour wait, and finally they just swapped out the whole stereo system. Two months later, the convertible top failed to go down, and another trip to the showroom (and a one day drive in a loaner car) resulted in a (free) replacement of a microswitch for the top. Last, the car smelled like sulfur (rotten eggs) for the first 9000 miles. The dealer said this was &quot;normal&quot; but I never had that problem on by 1991 stripped down 900.

Now that the car has been running smoothly for a year, I have nearly forgotten about all these bugs and simply enjoy being able to put the electric top down in 30 seconds and cruise to the beach. Also, it is the one ragtop that really does get you through a New England winter! It is triple insulated and the heating system is great! (Thanks to those Swedish engineers.) It is tough for me to drive a car without heated seats in the winter, now.

I bought this vehicle because I just couldn't bear to buy a Mercedes or a Porsche (too expensive), an Audi (all those problems with the 5000 a number of years ago), a teeny car, or a cheap domestic convertible. The Saab has front wheel drive and is probably one of the safest convertibles on the road with two front airbags. As I mentioned before, the back seat is huge for a convertible, and you can also put the rear seat down to haul stuff around if you want.

There really are only 4 seats. Do not buy this car if you are married and have three children! Do not buy it if you plan to do lots of highway driving, because it is noisy at high speeds (crank the radio). Do buy it if you want to start tanning BEFORE you get to the beach.<br><br>
