            Very standard - looks very much like a million other standard sedans. No better or worse but where it truly pales in comparison to every other car I've ever owned is it's maneuverability. It handles extremely poor and keep in mind I'm a middle aged woman doing highway driving, hardly running it through a James Bond type obstacle course. It has THE largest turning radius on the planet. Don't even think of doing a U-turn with this baby - it ain't gonna happen. Very uncomfortable for long trips - almost a claustrophobic feeling. Lots of highway noise. It is however, fairly good on gas and does have considerable pep. After riding in it for 3 hours, my passengers jokingly asked me to call the fire department and have them bring the "jaws of life" to extricate them.  Should your company allow you to drive one for free, then accept it. Should your dealer offer you an exceptionally good deal on one, sleep overnight on the idea first.
