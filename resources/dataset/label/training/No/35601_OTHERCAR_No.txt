            My husband and I bought a Malibu LS because we worked for a subsidiary of GM and were able to get a price below invoice and great financing.  A similarly loaded Camry would have cost us about $5,000 more and didn't seem worth it at the time.  We had had one as a rental and were impressed with the big trunk and how easy it was to drive, meaning that nothing annoyed us about the design of the car.

Our Malibu LS came loaded with a V6 engine.  Some of the features the LS comes with: AC, power windows/locks, power driver seat, CD and tape ($200 option), lighted passenger mirror, daytime running lights and auto on lights, keyless entry.  When you compare these features to a similarly loaded Camry or Accord, the Malibu is a really good value.  

The Malibu interior is wonderfully designed but we have had several problems with the car.  The good stuff:  The car is very roomy.  There are 4 cup holders and the back cup holders fold out of the back of the front armrest so they are accessible with three people in back.  The trunk is humongous.  The controls are well-layed out, easy to read and reach.  The front seats are comfortable for multi-hour car rides.  The V-6 engine is very peppy.  The interior styling is modern and reminiscent of an Accord and not a typical GM ugly design.  All-in-all, the Malibu LS is hard to beat when you compare it to other family sedans.  The bad stuff:  We have had the same brake rotor problem as others have posted here.  Ours started shimmying when applied under high speed (a scary defect!) around 31K miles and the front brake rotors ended up getting replaced by the dealer under warranty.  At 51K miles, we have not had the problem show up again.  Very early on the radio lost reception due to bad routing of the radio wiring (under the front passenger feet) which was repaired under warranty and has not been a problem since.  For the past 15K miles or so we have experienced a problem where the AC cuts in and out.  We have not had this fixed yet.  My husband has recently noticed a problem with the cruise control not behaving properly.  Because of these problems and the fact that we commute 80 miles per day we are thinking of selling the car in the near future and getting an Accord or Camry.<br><br>
