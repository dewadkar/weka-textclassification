            When I graduated from college, I decided that my first purchase when I got a job would be a car.  I had been driving a car of my parents, but I decided I wanted a car that was in my own name - that was wholly mine.

So I began to do some research.  I test drove many cars within a moderate price range, and I decided that the best value for my money would be a Saturn.

My parents knew someone who was a used car dealer, and he agreed to find a Saturn for me so I could buy it through him.

I ended up with a 1992 SL2.

To sum up a year in a very short sentence, this car was in the shop more than it was out of it.

However, the service department at Saturn was very nice - and I had decided that when the time was right, I would buy a brand new Saturn.

That day came when the Alternator went on my car with just 50,000 miles on it (I had bought the car with 32,000 miles on it).  I finally decided that this car was more trouble than it was worth, and I purchased a brand new 1996 Saturn SL1 in October of 1995. 

Overall, I was happy with the car.  I do have to say that the way that the Saturn is designed helped it to save my life in a really bad accident that I was in - the entire side of my car actually crumbled - but the steel cage underneath was intact.  However, it was not enough to convince me that i should buy another one when strange things began to happen to it after 40,000 miles or so.

The final decision came to get rid of the car when at 51,000 the alternator went on the car.  I got it replaced, however at just 53,000 the electrical system started to go.

I traded it in for a completely different make/model of car in November of 1998.

So - though the service department is top of the line, I do not think after the similar experiences I had with BOTH cars at similar mileage points, I will ever get another Saturn.<br><br>
