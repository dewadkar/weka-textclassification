            We bought a used 1996 Corsica as a second vehicle and a primary vehicle for my teenage daughter.  I liked the fact that it had anti-lock brakes and, judging from other reviews I read, it was a reliable, solid car.  We've had one problem after another since buying this vehicle.  

First, we had to replace the tires -- it seems that they were bad and the car literally bucked like a bronco on the highway after the first month.  Then, my daughter was in a minor fender bender.  She hit a car that had stopped at a stop sign ahead of her.  She later told me that the brakes didn't work -- that the car just didn't stop.  I took the car out and tried the brakes and they appeared to be working to me, so I figured she was just telling stories to keep from getting in trouble.  THEN, I had the opportunity to drive the Corsica full-time for about a week while my primary vehicle was in the shop!  What a revelation!  The Corsica would skitter all over the road when you would attempt to stop if there was any kind of imperfection in the road's surface.  The back end would fishtail and the car was difficult to keep under control.  And, as my daughter had claimed, the car did not brake smoothly to a stop -- instead it would grab the road, then seem to loose contact for awhile.  I immediately took the car to a mechanic I trusted and found that the rear shocks were shot.  After replacing these, the back end handles much better, but I still don't trust the vehicle.  

We've also had to replace the main belt TWICE in the less than two years of owning the vehicle.  If it rains, the entire passenger floor becomes flooded.

Perhaps we just got the exception rather than the rule, but I would never buy another Corsica again.<br><br>
