              When I went to aruba for 5 days with my family I knew they were gonig to talk me into getting some kind of jeep, which is not my kind of vehicle.  i am a sports car guy since my early days and SUV's are only of use for family outings for me (I have a lincoln navigator at home).  So very reluctantly, I bought into them and went out and rented an old (for a rent-a-car) 1997 Geo Tracker 2 door automatic 2 wheel drive soft top from a friendly Indian man.

   My wife drove the vehicle most of the time just going aronud the little island in search of shops with my daughter while my sons and I layed on the beach for hours.  But that was until the weekend came, and I suggested to my wife and my son and daughter that we go to the desert end of the island to see the natural bridge and pool.

  Come saturday, me, my wife, my 14 year old son and my 12 year old daugter got in the tracker and headed out.  My oldest son stayed at the beach.  It was very small inside the tracker, but the smallness poayed off when we got to the desert. Bounding over rocks and sand dunes, the little traker remaind calm and got us through many places where we were 100% sure it would get stuck.  It was so easy to drive, I let my son drive it through half the desert.  2 hours later with a dusty little tracker, we headed to the natural pool.  When we got there, we were like WOAH.  THere was a steep grade completely on a rocky narrow trail that was 2 miles long to get up to the pool and most people thoguht only quads and horses could go up it.  We proved them wrong.  With another tracker and a samll suzuki SUV behind us and a quad tour in front of us, we hit the trail.  The little tracker bounced.  I hit my head several times off the roll bar and got blisters on my hands from sterring so much.  It was amazing that the 2 wheel drive model offered so much ground clearance that we could get over any obstacle in our way including gouging rocks and evil sand.  The little 4 cylender, even when equipped with a poiwer sapping automatic, provided good power  nad torque off road, but once you got back on ther road, it dangerously lacked it.  

    I was impressed that a 2 wheel drive economy vehicle could make it htrough such rough terrain, but the tracker safely provided, even though we shook it to peices.
