            I purchased my Saturn used in 1997. I was driving past the dealership and
saw a plum colored car. Any shade of purple is my favorite color.  After a couple of trips past I stopped to look. Went for a test drive, read the articles on the safety features,looked at the cutaway Saturn and decided to buy. The sales staff were very nice.

The one I got has a 5 speed manual transmission.  The mileage is terrific
in town I get 25 miles to the gallon, on longer freeway travel the mileage is in the 30-35 mpg range.  The car handles well in most situations.  I do
not have power steering so  parking is a real problem,it takes a lot of 
strength to turn the wheel, at a complete stop.

The interior was not meant for large people.  The front is okay for taller people, not great but okay.  My 6'3&quot; son doesn't like driving it as he feels cramped.  He cannot sit in the back seat at all except by sitting
crosswise on the seat.  I am only 5'1&quot; so the size is fine.  The seats in 
my very basic car are not really comfortable to sit in for long periods of 
time.

The maintenance has not been particularly high,  I have replaced the clutch, the battery, and have purchased new tires. My car has fairly high mileage.  I have it regularly serviced for all the basic maintenance items.

The car is positively prone to high road noise.  I feel as if there is not 
sufficient noise deadening insulation in the floor. At highway speeds there is a wind noise from the windows,they do not seal well.

The biggest thing that I am disappointed in is when Saturn has problems
with the cars.  They issue an advisory telling the owner that if they experience particular problems to bring it in to be checked.  They charge
a standard mechanic fee to check to see if your particular car has the problem. I feel this is unfair, if they have a mechanical defect that can
cause big problems in some of the cars they should check for the problem
for free not charge the owner.  I bought into the whole &quot;Saturn family&quot;
concept when I purchased.  I went to the &quot;family&quot; get together at the dealership, Wanted to go back to Tennesee for the &quot;family&quot; reunion.  I felt as if my &quot;Saturn family&quot; had cheated me when I was charged a $80
fee to check my car.  I had recently had experience with how the Ford
motor co deals with defects.  They send out an alert letter, you take the car to the dealer they check for the defect for free and fix it for free.
Needless to say when I purchase a new vehicle it will positively not be a Saturn!!  No more buying into a &quot;family&quot; concept!!  I no longer have the dealer service my car, I have it done by an independent company
now.  I want nothing to do with the &quot;Saturn family&quot;
