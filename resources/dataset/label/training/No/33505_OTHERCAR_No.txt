            I have gotten much use out of my ClickSmart 510.  I've done it all: had a videoconference with friends, taken snapshots, and even used the motion detector a few times to see who had been using my computer.  In no way should this be your main camera, however.

This Logitech camera is a fun toy to play around with, and is nice to have.  The quality of the pictures, however, just doesn't cut it for photos that belong in the family album.  The resolution is very limited, and pictures can turn out dark sometimes.  For simple snapshots to email to friends or post on a website, it gets the job done.

The interface on the actual camera is easy to use - there are three settings for picture resolution, and flash options as well.  Everything is based on icons, so it is necessary to know what the icons mean (it's not really that hard).  The camera itself is built like a brick, it seems.

Battery life does not seem that great - because I always have it plugged into my computer through USB, it would have been nice to see a recharge feature.  A (sometimes) nice feature is that the camera will shut off after a certain period of disuse.  While I haven't timed or read about the actual amount of time, it's not very much, and it does get repetitive and annoying if you're taking many pictures over an extended amount of time.

The 8MB SmartMedia card that came with it has been more than enough for me, storing 100  pictures in lower resolutions.  Cards of greater capacity can be inexpensively purchased just about anywhere, if necessary.

I really don't have many complaints about the camera - it can do a countless number of things.  I don't look for it to serve as my main camera to capture the family memories. The Logitech ClickSmart 510 really isn't the best at anything it does - but it can do everything.
