            Upon purchasing my vehicle new in 1998, I was doomed for failure when I never made it home that day. The car performs great on many days, and with some aftermarket items, dresses up quite well. However, I have tallied 19 shop visits in 23 months, and when I requested GM to repair many recent troubles under their &quot;goodwill&quot; program, the response I received was, &quot;We would recommend purchasing an extended warranty next time.&quot;  Perhaps the most immediate problem I have had is the replacement of 3rd water pump, which was in vain, because I warped a head gasket with only 72K miles on the engine (dealership claims it to be water pump failure, but that I did not recognize the signs of over-heating, I would not be compensated for my troubles). After that trauma, I have recently found my car (4cyl/Auto) slipping into Neutral for a quick moment, and then back into drive.  Apparently, there is a Technical Service Bulletin 67-71-64 issued February 22,1997 which addresses this problem for Grand Ams with the 4T60E automatic transmission. The technical bulletin acknowledges the failure of the control valve assembly within the transmission, but Pontiac will not reimburse the client in the event of such failure. In my finding by researching the internet, and haven spoken with many prior Grand Am owners, my troubles were not exclusive to my vehicle. Many, many other repairs have ensued, including a failed ABS thingie-majiggie, constant warped rotors, and seemingly endless amounts of serpentine belts. The vehicle has been in one side-impact accident in the rear door, and is religiously maintained mechanically (more for the fear of being trapped in nowhere-land), however, I have placed almost the same amount of money into repairs as I have into the principal amount owing on the vehicle itself. As to date, the car is running on it's third year of operation, 2 engines, 3 water pumps, and soon to be 2nd transmission later, with only 87K miles. My opinion? By a Huffy....<br><br>
