            I bought this camera in the summer of 2000, and I thought it was one of the best 2.1 megapixel cameras... I even convinced my friend to buy one... While it took excellent quality pictures during the day I found the flash to be weak and pictures turned out bad in dark settings. That gripe I could live with... however, just two weeks ago (about half a year after I purchased it), I picked it up and turned it on to find SYSTEM ERROR on my display panel. It produced a clicking noise as if something was wrong with the zoom. I rarely used my camera, and always treated it with the greatest care. However, it still broke after minimal use. 

Upon researching my problem online, I found that other people had exact symptoms like this on Nikon digital cameras spanning the whole Coolpix line. From my research I learned (not 100% accurate, but seems accurate to me) that Nikon's firmware had a bug in which in certain instances, your camera would exhibit symptoms like mine (they even said someone found a certain combination in one of the Nikon cameras that will reproduce an error that could potentially damage it) BUYER BEWARE!!! While an excellent camera when it works, there are inherent flaws in perhaps the firmware that obviously Nikon was too lazy to take care of in developing their cameras. Because of this error, I have to send it back to Nikon (good thing it's still under warranty) for them to repair it... I haven't got around to that yet, so I can't say anything about their service.

And about my friend who I recommended to purchase this camera, his ended up broken too, although he dropped it. Still Nikon should try to make their products more durable, I'm sure plenty of people have dropped digital cameras on accident and they still work... so while when the camera works, it is an excellent camera, however the reliability of it is another matter...

If you want even more details on my dilemma, feel free to e-mail me.

*** UPDATE ***
I brought the camera in directly (I could've mailed it in also but the repair center was nearby) to Nikon and they took it in. Since it was still under warranty, they repaired it free of charge, I would assume a non-warranty repair would be costly. Nevertheless, I received my camera back within a week (they shipped it to me, no charge) and it was as good as new. They said they replaced the zoom motor and did a general check and clean. So kudos to Nikon for fixing their product hassle free. However, it still never should have broke in the first place, and all this is an inconvenience. So my opinion is still not too great about Nikon, but its a bit better since they did well on the repair. They also fixed my friends which was dropped (even though dropping isn't considered a warranty repair), I would just say 'stretch the truth' and if they ask you if you dropped it, tell them no :P!
