            I leased this vehicle back in 1997 around the time it was being introduced on the East Coast. Some of the things that are in my Sportage are the standards like Power Windows, door locks, mirrors, AC, premium stereo/cassette. I got mine with a power sunroof. To make it more fun, I got it with 5 speed transmission. Apart from being a good looking car, the vehicle is a lemon. Some of the problems i've had with this car include my air bag light came on, my check engine light came on, loose belts, bad clutch (at 12,000 miles), replaced muffler, rough idling engine, and the list goes on. Of course you get a 36,000 mile warranty so all of this was covered. Unfortunately, KIA doesn't provide a rental despite the fact that their &quot;well made&quot; car was my ride back and forth to work. Even the KIA repair facility wouldnt provide me with a &quot;courtesy&quot; car. So, the car rental costs came out of pocket on over 3 occasions, which amounted to a little over 300.00. In speaking with KIA about this inconvenience, they would only offer that the repair facility MAY provide me with a courtesy car. 

Being that I leased this car, I am relieved that I will not be owning it when the lease is expired. Especially since, at 44,000 miles, the problems i've had with this car before have given rise again. Only this time, I am faced with the cost of repair AND a rental car. Sigh. 

UPDATE: 

In one week I spent over 800.00 in repairs (Brakes, tires, throttle body, and a wire short). These repairs were costly for normal wear and tear at only 52,000 miles. Since I haven't had a tune up yet, I forsee another trip to the repair shop. I will now plan my financial loss around this car. 

Do yourself a favor and DONT BUY OR LEASE THIS CAR. Unless you are wealthy and like putting your car in the shop. Sure, it's a nice looking SUV but you'll pay out of the &lt;insert bad word here&gt; for it!  <br><br>
