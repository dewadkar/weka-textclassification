            Repairs are extensive, expensive,  and many.  Service department from both agencies are way out of line on pricing parts and labor.  This problem existed from the beginning after the warranty expired.  
District office was not of any help either.  Very bad customer service.  The looks of the car is what originally sold me.  
It drives very beautifully. I would not recommend this used car for anyone who will need to use the back seat.  It is impossible to get in and out of the seat, without bruises, and strength in legs.  
The fuel injectors have failed twice $2,000 per job.  The computer chip in the electronic dash is out.  Can't read speed, oil, etc. 
$800 to fix.  Air conditioner compressor is out also $800. All these happened while the car was fairly new, but out of warranty.<br><br>
