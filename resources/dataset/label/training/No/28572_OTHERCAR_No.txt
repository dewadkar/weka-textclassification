                It is a fun vehicle to drive, I will give it that much however, safety is an extreme factor.  I would not suggest that any one purchase a Jeep, Wrangler if they are looking for dependability.  We purchased one brand new in the summer of 97, within one year my daughter was almost killed because as she was driving down a busy street there was suddenly no steering whatsoever, the mechanic at the dealership had never seen anything like it in his life.  Oh and did I mention that it was not covered under their so called warranty.  I had to pay for the service out of pocket.  Next major major problem was the powersteering seal.  We then decided to purchase the seal ourselves and repair the problem on our own, the instructions on the new kit explicitly stated to take out the four seals and replace them in the exact same position as the old, well we replaced four seals however, the factory failed to put in four they only installed three, no wonder it leaked.  The pitman arm also disconnected.  It is impossible to keep tires on these vehicles so if you are looking for something economical to maintain, the Jeep Wrangler is not the vehicle for you.  Even for a four cylinder, it does not even give good gas mileage.  The air conditioning unit it is was bad from the start.  Good thing it is a rag top and it is rarely used.  All in all I would never advise a friend or relative to purchase one of these vehicles.<br><br>
