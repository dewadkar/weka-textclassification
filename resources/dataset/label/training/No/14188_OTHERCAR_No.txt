            I bought my Chrysler LHS when it was a year old.  The car had just come in to the dealership off a 12 month lease and was in excellent shape.  Luckily, when I purchased it, I added the 7 year - 75000 mile extended warranty package that Chrysler offered.

This car has a ton of room inside.  In addition the truck is huge.  With the 3.5 Liter engine, its performance was very good, and, the car consistently delivered 25+ MPG running on the interstate.  The car also handled and stopped very well considering its size.

Mine had the deep forest green paint job that appeared to change color depending on how the light hit it.  During my period of ownership I got numerous comments on how pretty the car was.  I especially liked the leather seats.  They were very comfortable on long trips.

I ended up selling the car simply because it developed problems that the dealer couldn't solve.  The air-conditioning evaporator coil inside the vehicle blew out twice and had to be replaced by the dealer.  The most vexing problem was the cruise control.  On hot days, it either didn't work at all, or, hold the vehicle at only 70 MPH.  Despite many trips to the dealer, they simply couldn't fix it.  The car's parting shot at me was to spring a nice oil leak out of the front of the engine.  After several trips to the dealer to get gaskets replaced with no success, I'd had enough with this thing and traded it off for a new Dodge Intrepid.  Luckily the car had held enough resale value to just about pay itself off.
