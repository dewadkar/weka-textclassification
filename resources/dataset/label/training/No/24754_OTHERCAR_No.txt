            We had a 1999 Buick LeSabre Custom as a loaner car for two days while our Volvo was being serviced.  We put about 100 miles on it, in driving from the dealer to our home and back.

The LeSabre is Buick's best-selling model ever.  Supposedly about 2 million of these things have been built/sold since the 1950's.  I don't imagine they drive much differently, either.  If you like a nice comfy couch on wheels, this is the car for you.  It has nice soft seats, nice easy steering and brakes, and a nice stereo.  The ride is nice and soft.

Personally, I nearly got seasick driving the thing on the expressway.  I found the ride to be floaty like a 20' motorboat.  The 3800 V-6 had more than enough power to cruise at 80mph, but the brakes were absolutely without feedback, as was the steering.  I approached one curve at 35mph, a curve which was signed by the Indianapolis Street Dept. as a 35mph curve.  Somewhere away up in the front recesses of the car, I could hear a distant tire squealing away like a stuck pig around the whole curve.

Trying to drive in a straight line was somewhat of a challenge as well, as the car desperately wanted to float back and forth in its lane, and the numb steering assisted that desire.

However, the LeSabre does have a trunk the size of a hangar, plenty of stretch-out room, and a bunch of the gadgets Americans love, like &quot;Twilight Sentinel,&quot; (automatic headlights) and a dinger which goes off if you leave your blinker on for more than 3 miles.

And if you regularly leave your blinker on for that long, the LeSabre is right up your alley.<br><br>
