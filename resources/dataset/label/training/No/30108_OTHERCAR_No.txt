            CNET reviews were glowing - and the camera admittedly has the best essential features (2 megapixels, USB connection, and a whopping 20-megabyte memory card included).  I even shopped around and got a decent price.  

But the camera is disappointing in action.  The auto focus doesn't always work right, and high resolution doesn't make up for poor focus.  The shutter can be delayed too, especially when you're taking several shots in succession (hey, with a capacity of over 100 pictures at medium resolution, who ISN'T going to take several pictures in a row?).  There's no warning that the shutter isn't going off when you expect it to, and you can end up with lots of shots of your shoes.

A through-the-lens viewfinder would be great - and it's not impossible to do either, because other manufacturers have TTL models.  The LED display is awkward to use for composing, and non-TTL viewfinders can't be completely accurate at all distances.  

So - I have a camera that cost 5 times as much as my old DC20, and it isn't anywhere near 5 times better.  If I had it to do over again, I'd buy a mid-range model, like a DC200, and wait for the high-end cameras to live up to their hype.   <br><br>
