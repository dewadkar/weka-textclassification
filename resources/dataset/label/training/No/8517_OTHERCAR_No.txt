                 I recently took the top three full size pick-ups for a test drive.  I own a 2000 Silverado, and was in the market for another truck for my son.  I must say I didn't drive the GMC, because it really is the same as the Chevy.  The Dodge was my first choice, mostly because it was the least expensive, kinda.  The interior of the Dodge was great, it was a huge wide open area, well instrumented and comfortable.  It gave you a good solid feeling while sitting behind the wheel.
     Both the Dodge and the Chevy made you feel like you were driving a livingroom down the road.  Lots of room, nice comfortable seats.  The Ford felt kinda cramped, and a little on the cheesy side inside.  I didn't get the feeling of quality from Ford.  What a shame, they make a good product.  Since kids are kids, and he will be wanting to drive around his friends, I looked at the extended cab versions of Dodge and Chevy.
     Here is where I started to draw my line.  The Dodge's rear seat was nothing more than just a board covered with cloth.  Very uncomfortable.  I had the dealer drive me around while I sat in the back (I felt like a real goober sitting back there, no wonder I use to call shot gun).  The Chevy had a larger, more comfortable seat, It still wasn't much, but it was much better.
     Then for the killer.  The gas mileage.  The Dodge drank gas compared to the Chevy.  Two miles to the gallon really adds up over the years.  Believe me, I've been driving these gas drinkers for years, and I value my mileage.  The Dodge is a nice vehicle, but for a few (just a few) dollars more, I went for the Chevy.  I felt it had more quality, and the milage will help out in the long haul.<br><br>
