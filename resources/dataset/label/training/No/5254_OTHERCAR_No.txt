            Bought a 1990 Mazda Protege a few years back. All I have to put in it is gas and the key to make it go. I have had NO major failures of any component of the car.  Solid, dependable and does not drain my wallet with annoying repairs.  The drive is comfotable, quiet and steady.  Those of you who are sick of lemons would fall in love with this car.  The only problem I have had was a cracked radiator toptank, and that was not a pricey fix.  You do have to do the regular things though, oil, brakes the occasional exhaust but these are typical of any car.  As for a family car I wouldn't recommend since it tends to be small, but for your own personal vehicle it's great.  The only problem I could forsee is that IF I had to get it fixed at a garage the replacement parts would tend to be on the high side since the car is foreign.  But that has not happened yet.  I want to reiterate that the ride is solid, and i mean solid, no rattles or squeaks or whatnot, they designed and built this thing right.  I don't know about the other Proteges but the 1990 is the best thing I've owned yet.<br><br>
