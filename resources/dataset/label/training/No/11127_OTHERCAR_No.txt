            This review is based on the 2002 4 cylinder LE. My 1998 Accord EX was in the shop for repairs, so I decided to rent a Camry. My wife was very fond of the styling and we figured this car would be on the top of our list to replace the Accord, if we ever decided to trade it in. 

The exterior is the highlight of the Camry. With styling very much in the Lexus vein, the outside appears much more stylish than the previous Camry. On closer inspection though, the side body work looks too tall in proportion with the windows. This is very apparent from the driver's seat. The sills are way too tall creating the feeling of sitting in a bathtub. Other impressions from the driver's seat: the design team should be ashamed for so many mis-steps. The gap between the windshield and hood is very visible, a mistake usually seen on GM cars. And the dash is just terrible. I am 6' tall , but I had to lean to the right to adjust the radio. In contrast, my Accord's radio controls just seem to fall right into place and require no repositioning of the driver. The rest of the interior seemed decent enough, if not a bit bland. The materials fit together well and their quality is nice, much better than the cheap plastics preferred by the big 3.

But as bad as the ergonomics are, they can't hold a flame to the brakes. The brake pedal on my 1967 Mustang had less play than the Camry's. The pedal travel was about 50% before any sensation of braking. Full braking requires pushing the pedal into the carpet. We are not talking panic stops here, we are talking gradually slowing from 35 mph for a stoplight! And for those who feel this was a fluke: I took the first Camry back to Hertz as I thought the brakes were defective. Personally I want a car with communicative brakes, like a BMW or a Maxima. Maybe I am oversensitive, having ridden motorcycles for 10 years and expect good brakes on a vehicle. If you like mushy brakes, though, this is your car for sure. As for the Camry's handling, it was not too bad for a family sedan, but felt more Buick-like than my Accord. I rented a 2001 Camry and would say the handling is very similar. The engine (4 cyl) was nice enough and quiet until revved. Shifting was smooth. Am sure the drive-train will be good for at least 200k, given Toyota's reputation.
