            The good and the bad about the Passat!

I love this car - I love the exterior, the interior, the dashboard, everything about it.  That's why I bought it.

It's not too great on the power end, I have the Turbo 4 with Tiptronic transmission and the turbo has a lag and takes forever to kick in - but I'm still happy with the car.

The things I really hate - and I hate these so much that I'd take the car back today if possible - are:

that the display is great but should be reversed - black on blue background - it's nearly impossible to read during the day.

that the car gets door dings sooooo easily, the rubber guards are not on the correct part of the door, and they're not large enough.  Just changing these two things would prevent door dings.

that the mirrors do not cover blind spots at all.  The right side mirror is a lot smaller for no apparent reason.  This has caused me to have a few close calls!

that the bumper is soooo low that it scrapes every parking block and curb in the world... the plastic splash guard under the car &quot;should just be removed&quot; according to the dealership.  Just this week it finally scraped for the last time and the left part of my front bumper separated from the rest of the car.  If the car were two inches higher this never would have happened.  

This was the final straw... now I'll have to get another car after spending nearly $2500 on getting the door dings and bumper fixed before returning the vehicle - and I have another 17 months left on the lease!
