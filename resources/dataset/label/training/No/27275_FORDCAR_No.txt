            It is a 92, got it used about a year after it came out so it was basically as close to factory condition as you�r going to get without actually being there, so let me talk about ours, the cigerette lighter in the back doesnt work is our only major problem, but we don't need that anyway.  So we've been in several accidents with it, some in which would be classified as &quot;totaled&quot; to the cost, even though it wasn't all that bad anyway, so we got them all fixed, and it still runs pretty good, sometimes the heat doesn't work but besides that there little or no problems.<br><br>
