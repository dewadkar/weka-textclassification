            We bought our Voyager in May 1998.  We started by just looking because we knew we needed the extra room (we had a 1996 Saturn).  We bought it the first day in this particular dealership(mistake number 1).  In the year and a half that we have had it we have had it in for about 3-4 major repairs.  We have had to have all of the injectors replaced, some kind of thermostat replaced, the whole front windshield replaced and then little stuff replaced (like the light lens cover and door switch for the interior light).  
Actually driving the van, aside from the problems, it is ok.  It does not get good gas mileage at all.  I don't believe that I love anything about this vehicle.  For the money though I wish we would have looked at our other options, such as Explorer or such.
I don't really believe their is a certain type of person who should by this van.  It is pretty roomy.  The third seat does not have hardly any room for their legs though.  People with 3 or more kids could find this a useful means of transportation but I am not sure if I would recommend relying on this for your only means of transportation.<br><br>
