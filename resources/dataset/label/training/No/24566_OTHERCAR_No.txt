            I wanted a car that was not too flashy but still had lots of features, like leather, power everything, etc. The Malibu fit the bill at literally thousands less than its Japanese competitors. Lower price plus lower interest rates equals much lower lease rates, so the Accord, Camry and Altima worked out to be much more expensive.

The LS with the leather package is the way to go. It includes a half-decent radio with cassette and CD, cruise, power seat, windows, door locks and mirrors, remote keyless entry, a sunroof, auto headlights, etc. 

I wish GM had included heated seats, which are becoming the norm in at least the upscale model of most family sedans. I commend GM for including programmable automatic door locks, but I wish they had included a couple more lines of software code for a mode that unlocks the locks when you shift into park. The only options for automatic unlocking require the car to be turned off before the locks will unopen, a nuisance when picking up and dropping off. On the other hand I could have done without the spoiler that is mandatory with the leather package. The spoiler doesn't do much for the looks or handling of this car; I think it looks kind of silly on what is obviously a bland family hauler.

There is a driver's side cupholder on the left side of the steering wheel, an odd feature that is actually quite sensible for 90% of us.

Another curious absence is any kind of lighted indicator on the dashboard to show what gear you are in. It's easy to go right past overdrive into 3l, so be careful when putting this car into gear, especially at night. 

The seats are comfortable initially, but quickly become uncomfortable. The lumbar support is thick, high and unadjustable, so unless you are the perfect height, forget about it. If you are considering this car be prepared to sit in it for at least a half-hour before making any decisions.

Unfortunately, GM really dropped the ball on quality here. Their ads trumpet the Malibu's achievement in J.D. Power's Quality surveys. But if you read the fine print, you see that they are talking about initial build quality. 

I can't complain about the build quality of the Malibu. It arrived fully functional and with no obvious rattles, loose screws or build flaws. Sure, the panel gaps are way wider than on a Toyota or Honda, but the car itself is well built.

The problem occurs when you actually drive the car. In just one year of ownership and driving less than 12k miles, I've had to replace the radio, the AC unit (twice) and worst of all the front brake pads and rotors (twice) -- the latter not under warranty. After running very smoothly for the first month, the engine started getting rough, and fuel consumption has climbed dramatically. The dealership said there's nothing wrong with the car.

I've asked lots of Malibu owners about their experiences, and I am not alone in having trouble with the Malibu.
