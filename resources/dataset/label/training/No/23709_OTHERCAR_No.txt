            Recently our 12 year old Nissan Stanza decided it was time to retire so my wife and I went out car shopping, we ended up buying a 2003 KIA Spectra. It seemed like a nice car, fit and finish is good and the factory stereo sounds really nice for a oem job. We now have 9000 miles on it and the engine is just starting to get broke in. The power and mileage was poorer than I had thought it should be but now it is coming to life, we get about 31MPG (as long as we keep our feet out of it) with the Automatic and it can hold it's own on the freeway. There are a couple drawbacks to freeway driving, the road noise on concrete and older pavement surfaces is really bad, we had to install thick floor mats to help dampen this out and it is still loud! Also if you plan to put two adults in the back seat be advised that the little KIA will want to wander side to side as the front end gets a bit light from the weight of the rear occupants. The ride quality is pretty good, the seats are comfy and it has very ample leg room so long drives aren't too bad, just keep the stereo up a bit to cancel the road noise. I do my own oil changes on a lift so I had a chance to check out the underside of my KIA, most of it looks pretty good down there except for the rear axle mounts, they look to me a bit on the small side. The automatic transmission is a bit on the shift happy side, it shifts to overdrive at any speed even at 25 mph, this makes the engine sound like it is lugging a bit. I usually keep the transmission out of overdrive in town. One nice thing about the interior are all the little nick-nacks KIA has engineered into it, the overhead sunglass holder is just neat, as are the individual map lights. The cup holders are adjustable in size and the little cubby in the rear of the center console is nice since the top of the lid also opens up to store small items. All in all it isn't a bad little car for the money, would I buy one again? I think not. Should you? Depends on your prioraties.
