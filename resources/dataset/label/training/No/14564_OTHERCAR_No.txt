            Sony did it again! They actually screwed up! I can't belive it! This was thew worst Sony product I have ever seen!

<b>The Looks </b>
This camera is a very brick or box like shaped camera like all the old Sonys. You have the big ol' lens the flash and the &quot;Take Picture&quot; button on the fron of the camera. The colors which are silver and black make the camera looks shiny and expensive. On the back of the camera is the little LCD screen, the ON/OFF button, the round scroller, flash button, disk eject button, display button, and picture setting buttons, and the zoom buttons. On the side is the place where you put the floppy disk and on the bottom is the battery hole.

<b>Why it is so bad </b>
First the camera chomps away on the battery non stop even while not doing anything. The screen is very bad and the picture is ackward. You have to hold the camera straight forward because if it is not right near your eyes you won't be able to see anything! To take a picture takes way too much time unlike the Sony Mavica FD-91 which has the 2X Speed Floppy Drive which you can really see the speed change. Also when you view a picture the same thing happends that you need to wait very very long till the picture shows up. The camera itself isn't the prettiest thing on the market and resembles a box more then a camera. When you review the pictures on your computer you will see that they are very bad quality and they are quite off-color. Also the biggest fault in the camera is that there is no view-finder.

<b>What is good </b>
The camera's colors are very stylish unlike its overall shape. On the LCD screen you can see the battery position and how many minutes of the same mode you are in. You can also see how full the disk is. Also if you want to give your kids a cheap camera to use this would also be it. It is very durable for one thing. It is made from very hard materials which will last for a long time.

<b>Overall </b>
This isn't a very good camera if you expecting a camera which is worth the money you pay for it. The picture is bad, the battery dies out fast, but if you need a camera for your kids this is the camera for you. But remember dont expect to much of this camera.<br><br>
