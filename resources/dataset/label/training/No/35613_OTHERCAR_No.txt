            Owning this car has been a continuous nightmare.  I purchased this vehicle about 2 1/2 years ago and have been regretting my decision to do so ever since.  I have learned more about rotors, brake pads, and calipers than I ever knew before and this is because I have taken them in to get repaired at least 8 times since buying the car (this is not an overstatement)!!  The braking system on this vehicle sucks.  My first experience was similar to a few of the other reviews that I have read on this site.  The car would alternate between squealing and grinding sounds when pressing on the brakes.  This started about 2-3 months after purchasing the car.  Initially I was told that the brake pads were worn, then I was later told that the calipers needed replacement.  Ever since replacing the calipers, I have been averaging about 2-3 brake services per year.  In addition to the brakes, there are electrical problems with this car as well.  Every blue moon, the radio and interior display lights will shut off for about 2 seconds and, immediately after doing so, comes back on.  Why?  Who knows.  A couple of the radio dials broke off in my hand while trying to adjust the bass and treble levels.  Oh, and now the stick used to shift gears comes off in my hand every now and then and will sometimes get stuck in "Park". The trick to keeping it mounted on the floor and shifting gears is to keep your foot on brake and slamming the outer shell (of the gear stick) back on the base really fast. The windshield wiping fluid will freeze over in cold temperatures, which is extremely inconvenient for those residing in colder climates (i.e. Michiganians like myself).  I don't want to make this an entirely negative review because amongst everything else, the vehicle does get me from point A to B and I haven't incurred any MAJOR damages (knock on wood) thus far, so I will say that the gas mileage I get out of it is pretty good, considering current economic conditions.  The dashboard makes a continual "clank"ing sound while driving, though.  I could go on and on venting about the shortcomings of this vehicle, but my fingers would tire for typing so long.  For sanity's sake, look elsewhere before purchasing a Chevy Malibu.
