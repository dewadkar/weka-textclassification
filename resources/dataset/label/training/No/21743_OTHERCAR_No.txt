            I have read many other people's opinions on this car and was amazed to see that I was not the only one experiencing the problems I am having!

The roof leaking is a BIG issue. I just had the roof fixed a month ago and it is now leaking again. Also, I don't know if it is how the car is shaped or what, but you can't even have the window cracked open even a tiny bit or the rain will pour in through the window.  It just rolls right down the inside of the car. My arm will be all wet and my leg too. The top is very easy to put up or down though. You just pull a handle and it does all the work for you! 

The car door and windows are very noisy too. When you shut the door is sounds like they are going to fall off! I think it is mainly the windows that make all the noise. It is like they are not secure enough or something.   The windows are noisy too while you drive along a bumpy road. 

I have problems when you have to sit somewhere. The bank, train or whatever. The car wants to overheat all the time. I have heard many other people complain if the same thing. 

The back seat does not have much leg room at all. It would not be a car that I would take on a long trip if I had to have someone in my backseat. The front seats seem comfortable to me. I love driving the car, it is comfy.

I love the look of this car. I have the Z-24, they do look a little bit more sporty than the regular Cavalier. It has some pick up too. I have no problems getting it to get up and go.  

Also, for being a little car the trunk is a pretty good size. You can get to your trunk from the inside too, which I like. It is nice when the kids are in the car. They can keep their things in the back trunk so that they are not crowded in the seat, but when they need them all they have to do is open the back of the seat and be able to have access to what ever they need. 

The gas mileage is GREAT! Which has been so helpful since the gas prices have been so high. 

All in all, it is a pretty good little car. It has its bad points and it has its good points. I wouldn't want it as my only car though. I have a minivan too, so I can drive that in the winter or when I want a more comfortable ride. But, we love taking the car out with the top down and strolling around town. I would not take this car on a long trip or anything like that. It just isn't comfortable enough. It is a good second car to drive to work or around town a little.
