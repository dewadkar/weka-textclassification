            Did you ever think you car was a time bomb of problems waiting to go off as soon as the 3 year 36 mile warranty expired?  Mine was!

I have a 2001 Jeep Cherokee Classic.  I have not had the car 3 years and I just had to replace the engine (3 days after a regular tune-up at the dealership). The car actually broke down on a highway 130 miles from home.  I had to pay to have it towed (though AAA has provided great service - the tow was over their 100 mile limit - so I had to cover the last 30 miles) It took a week and a half for the engine to be replaced during which I had to have a rental car.  I had to pay $1600 for the labor, $500 for the rental and $150 for the tow.  Chrysler paid for parts b/c they know they made a poor quality engine.  But - as a customer who has not had the car for 3 years - I should not have had to incur this expense or inconvenience due to their poor quality.  They should cover the labor and reimburse me for my additional expenses - if they care about their customer or believe in their product.  To top it all off - 1 day after picking my car up from the dealer with the new engine - the car broke down again - and I had to have the radiator replaced.  The dealer agreed to cover this (at their own expense)because they felt terrible for me.  My dealer is awesome - but Chrysler has hung them out to dry - by not standing behind the products they work so hard to sell and service.  I have always done all of the suggested maintenance on the car and should not have had this trouble.  I called Chrysler to ask them to cover the entire cost and they were rude and told me that they could not satisfy their customers and were not going to try.  I spoke to Eddie who's employee number is 116.  Eddie told me that his supervisor would not talk to me b/c he pays him to keep customers like me off of his back.  He also told me there is no corporate address or number I could call to escalate my concern to the next level.
