            I relate this story second hand from what I know� my parents don�t want to think about this anymore or take time to type up a testimonial.   I�m really angry at Toyota�s lack of customer loyalty, so I am venting my anger here.  I don�t have all the exact details of what happened and Mom and Dad are not in the mood to rehash the whole thing.  However,  I can relate what I remember learning while driving my Dad back and forth to the Toyota dealership during our last visit in January.   (Visiting Toyota three times was not what I had in mind for my limited time with my parents.)

First a little background�

Our family�s first Toyota was a used 1985 Camry that my Dad bought from a friend.  It was a dream car� no problems whatsoever.   After having owned multiple Chevrolets, all of which proved troublesome at one time or another, Mom and Dad were totally thrilled and figured they had finally found a manufacturer who understood the importance of quality and reliability� finally, no more maintenance headaches and unpredictable expenditures.   They purchased a used Corolla as a second car and once again had no problems.   Of course, we�ve heard many stories from friends who have put 200K or 300K miles on a Toyota without any problems.   �Everybody knows� if you buy a Toyota, you wont have to worry about reliability, right?  Isnt that the �brand promise�?  

So it was with the utmost confidence that my parents plunked down $18,000 in 1997 for a brand new Camry.  They really don�t like to buy new cars� but they figured it�s a Toyota, so at least they�d get their money�s worth and not have to hassle with repairs.

In 1999 the brakes started making weird noises.   Not the normal squealing brake noises that cars sometimes make, but a strange thud sound that definitely wasn�t normal.  They took the car in multiple times and ended up getting a different set of brake pads.  Toyota said something about a new material in the originals that did not work out.  Toyota covered the cost.  But the problems continued� the new brakes wore out after only 15K more miles of driving.  Now, my parents are retired� they drive slower and more carefully than ever, and they�ve never gone through a set of brake pads nearly that fast.  They definitely are not what you would categorize as aggressive drivers.   And the brakes went out after 15,000 miles??   More visits to Toyota, more puzzled looks and finally Toyota comes back and wants my parents to pay $300 to have the brake system �upgraded�.  Toyota wanted to put larger brake cylinders on the rear drum brakes.  They said that the rear brake cylinders were not hefty enough, and so the front discs were overheating and glazing as a result of the increased load.  Amazingly, Toyota wouldn�t admit that this is a design flaw, and when my Dad pressed them to pay for the repair, they refused, saying the car was now out of warranty.  Never mind that these problems had all started well before the end of the warranty period.  If Toyota had diagnosed the problem correctly the first time, the car would still have been under warranty.  And why should the warranty matter anyway?   We�re talking about a Toyota here.  If they thought they would need the warranty after only 3 years, my parents would not have bought the car in the first place.  

I talked to my Dad about it� we concluded that someone in upper management would surely understand the value of the Toyota brand image and would quickly fix this shortsighted decision by a lower manager.  
My Dad called Toyota corporate HQ, and kept getting the same response, eventually all the way up to the president�s office.  Some assistant to the president brushed him off, still insisting that brake cylinders needing to be upgraded is not a design problem, and if he wants it done, he will have to pay for it.

What a crock.

So my image of Toyota is definitely tarnished� I would have expected them to gladly repair this problem and be apologetic about it being there in the first place.   If they had done that, all would have been forgiven.    Is Toyota losing it�s edge?

BTW, I went shopping for a new car recently and ended up buying a 2000 Honda Accord SE.  Nice, nice car.  I had planned on buying a Camry...<br><br>
