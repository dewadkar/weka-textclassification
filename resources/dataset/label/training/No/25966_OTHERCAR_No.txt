               I drove Chevy Cavaliers for 9 years as company cars. I was given a new car each year(always a Cavalier).  When Chevy updated to the new body style a few years back, they also took a huge step back in many respects. This newer style car is quite frankly a piece of junk. It was by far the most uncomfortable, poor riding car I've ever had the displeasure to drive. Sitting in the seats is like sitting on a rock. They possess no lateral support and are shaped such that you are in a constant slouching posture. After 20 minutes in these things, my back was hurting and my legs went numb.
    The anemic 4 banger in the base model has barely enough power to get moving, much less get you on the highway in a hurry. Fuel economy wasn't great either, only 27mpg highway.
    There is adequate room up front, rear is a little cramped but OK. I did like the way the rear doors open to an extreme angle allowing ease of loading stuff into the rear seats.
    As far as reliability, forget about it. These cars have to be run so hard just to keep with traffic that they don't hold up. Our fleet consisted of @70 Cavaliers. Our problem level was so high we had trouble keeping everybody in their own cars. We suffered numerous engine troubles, transmission trouble, exhaust problems, as well as windshield trouble. Seems these cars eat windshields. I went through at least 2 per year with the new style.
    The really strange thing is that the old style wagons we used were fairly comfortable, powerful, and reliably. But not these new ones. Driving this car is like driving my old Radio Flyer. Rides like a buckboard. I can't recommend this car to even my enemies. <br><br>
