            Alright, to start out, I did not buy this car, but my sister did, and I had to drive it when I was younger.  It is cherry red, and has that very powerful V4.  This vehicle has served its purpose, getting you from place to place, however, other than that, it hasn't been all that great.  We tried to get it from Indiana to North Carolina, but it had no chance of making it.  The engine just plain gave out, the alternator went kaboom, and we had to tow it the rest of the way.  Then, I had to fix it, and the way that this cars engine is built is the most annoying thing I have ever put up with.

You cannot reach anything.  It is all hidden underneath something that you don't need to get to.  The engine was not designed very well, but I guess it was more meant for people who would have the car taken to a dealer, or repair shop, where they have better tools and such, but with this car, no one could afford that.  I like to do things myself though, so I went ahead and changed it.  It took me well over five hours, and most of it was spent getting the thing out of there.  I had help, and he said that he had never seen anything like that before(he owns a Mustang, and they never have problems like this.).  Well, enough about that story, lets get onto some specifics with the car.

<b> Engine </b>
Well, the engine, yeah, to start out with, it's a little quad four engine, with not very much power.  Good luck getting it much over seventy.  Not that speeding is good.  The engine tended to run poorly in lower gears.  If you were just idleing through the neighborhood, then it would often stall, or sometimes even die on us.  Now, as for the pickup from the engine, well, there was none.  If you wanted to get onto the highway from a still stop, then you had better have a lot of room.  As far as engine work however, there hasn't really been any, so I suppose you could call it a rather &quot;reliable&quot; car in that sense, but it just wasn't built for a whole lot of driving.

<b> Interior </b>
The interior has held up rather well over the years.  It is just a plain grey color.  The seats have not had to been fixed or anything.  The interior I would say is the best part of this car, there is nothing too flashy, but it is all very sturdy.  It has had no holes, no tears, and it is all around, very well designed on the inside.

<b> Exterior </b>
The exterior is also rather nice in this car.  It is cherry red, and when buffed right, has a rather nice shine.  It is before cars were made of mostly plastic, so if wrecked (she did it twice already), it does most of the damage, instead of taking most of it.  There is no rust on the car, and that is pretty good for going through nine Indiana winters.  Not a whole lot that you can say about the exterior, although, it looks rather nice.

<b> Ride </b>
The ride is not all that grand.  If you push the pedal very much at all, you can really here it.  It is not that it is a powerful loud, it is that the engine is struggling.  The ride is rather bumpy, and things that I can't find tend to rattle.

<b> Handling </b>
The handling in this car is very loose.  You can swerve the wheel back and forth without much reaction, and believe it or not, it does have power steering.  The handling is not one of the &quot;highlights&quot; of this car.  If you want a smooth ride, with easy comfortable handling, I do not suggest this car.

<b> Reliability </b>
Well, I suppose that it doesn't break down a whole lot, however, it does often stall, and sometimes dies.  We have not yet have it die on us while we were out of our neighborhood, thank god for that.  The brakes have been reliable, the interior and exterior have been reliable, however, certain parts of the engine haven't been.  It tends to run funny a lot, and I like to mess with it to try and improve it.  However, whenever it sounds good, she messes it up again, maybe its just her.

<b> Value </b>
Well, considering it only cost $4500, I suppose that I just feel partially ripped off.  It was cheap, however, so was the final product, so I suppose the value was a little less than what I paid for it.  It seemed to be reasonable at the time, but now I am not sure.

<b> Overall Wrapup </b>
Well, I don't suggest this car to you.  I would like to because it has some good features, but the bad outweigh the good.  I can't just ignore the engine because the interior and exterior look good.  Overall, if you are looking for a cheap car, with some steel for safety to help your kids out, then I do suggest this car.  However, if this car is for yourself, then I would not buy it.  It is not worth it, and you won't have fun in this car.  And having fun is what driving is all about.

I hope that you have enjoyed my review, and that maybe it has help you decide upon this car.
