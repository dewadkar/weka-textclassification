            I don,t want to write a long drawn out opinion on this only to say that a cars transmission should NEVER go out after 36,000 miles on a new car. I read a prior article and for a minute I thought my boyfriend beat me to this story. I had the same sad story of the transmission just dying and getting a $2,000 estimate... Luckily it was still under warranty but the rental car was not and they did NOTHING to help me out. Their explanation was that the warranty was like 2,000 miles prior. If they expect to give you warranty on the transmission they should expect to be willing to pay for the rental. Especially when it takes them THREE days to get parts, and the car is not ready when they say it will be. On top of that, nobody including Mitsubishi Corporate wants to say who is responsible for their decisions.  I had better luck with my old clunker than this. People buy a new car to not have these problems.. Ive had problems with the brakes, and the transmission- way too early in the game. My mom also bought a Mitsubishi prior and had her transmission go AFTER THE FIRST WEEK. Not a good choice if you buy one cross your fingers and pray.<br><br>
