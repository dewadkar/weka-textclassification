            This is an amazing car, given the ability to climb a step 18 inches high, go up a 45 degree incline, and be able to wade through water 3 feet deep.  But the value is just outrageous.  It just doesn't make sense to buy a Hummer.  Take a look at the stats: it goes 0-60 in approximately 20 seconds, it gets less than 15 miles/gallon, it costs $70,000-$90,000, and it is absolutely enormous which makes it hard to drive and park.  I will admit that it is nice and it attracts a lot of attention.  But unless you are rich and have nothing better to with your money or you go off-roading, this car just isn't for you.  There are many other NICER trucks and SUV's out there that are worth your money more than the AM General Hummer. <br><br>
