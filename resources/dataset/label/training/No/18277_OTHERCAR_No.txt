            I bought a 1997 Tracker brand new.  Unfortunately, when I test drove it, I didn't drive it on the highway and the wind wasn't blowing!  After having my Tracker for a few weeks, I realized what a mistake I had made!  Boy was I sorry!  It was not only the noisiest vehicle I ever owned, but the worst sitting, riding vehicle also.  Okay, so I didn't buy a luxury car!  But I expected to be able to hear my radio with the windows rolled up!  And heaven forbid if the wind blows......even a little wind.  It would blow you all over the road!  I would NEVER recommend this vehicle, not even to my worst enemy!  Hated it and could not get out of it fast enough!<br><br>
