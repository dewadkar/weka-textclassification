            My wife and I purchase a used 1998 Beetle.  It had 16,000 miles, and the warranty covers it up to 20 or 24k.
Just as soon as the car went out of warranty, the problems began.

The windows are huge in this car.  The power windows have a regulator ($240 plus dollars) that likes to fail.  Our passenger side regulator went out first, then the driver side.  Within 1 week of each other.  Can you say LEMON? 
Next, the engine started cutting out between shifts.  According to the dealer, the knock sensor regulators were bad, and needed to be replaced.  Another $200 after all was said and done.  I fought with Volkswagen to cover the costs.  The best they could offer is 50%.  For everyone out there experience the same thing, call them right away and fight till they will give you the 50%.  They claim that no matter what, you can't get more. 

It seems the dealers are offended that you as a consumer would call Volkswagen directly.  They act out on this offense by sluggishly finishing the work, and never calling you to let you know if the car is done or not.  They have yet to treat you like a customer, and would rather put you on hold for 15-20 minutes then give you a straight answer.  In fact, the dealer we went to had the gall to ask "Have you ever owned a Volkswagen before?" when we were upset.  As if to indicate that we were idiots to expect a quality vehicle, or quality service.  Sheesh.

In my opinion, - Volkswagen can take their trash back.  If I could find someone to offer assistance with a lawsuit, I would jump in.

We have had several troubles with the headlights.  I have taken the bulbs out so many times, I could do it with my eyes closed.  I finally discovered it is the wiring harness that is bad.  I crimped the harness real hard and that fixed it.  In the past 2 months, I have noticed about 6 other beetles with one headlight out, my guess is that they have the same issue.  Volkswagon Service denies any problems with their headlights.  

To top it off, 5 months later, the car is running poorly, the Engine Light just came on, ..... Ka Ching, there goes the wallet again.
