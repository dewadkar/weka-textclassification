            This vehicle has been nothing but trouble.Would never buy another one.
Do not recommend it to anyone.Dodge does not stand behind their product or their dealers.Have had 4 dodge dealers do diagnostics in the last 4wks.
and found 8 different things wrong.Had to have a new transmission and a
rear main oil seal put in to.Only has 64,000 miles on it.the repairs that
the 4 dealers found totaled 1,980.00.I wouldn't recommend this car at all.
Driving is good in handles very nice and is easy to drive.I bought this 
vehicle because I wanted room for my family and though dodge was a good
product.I've called the dealers and dodge all I have got is we have no control over what other dealers find.That all dealerships are privately
owned and are not dodges responsibility.I know cars do have repairs that
need to be made,but to have 8 different things found in 4wks. by 4 diff-
erent dealers is a bit extreme to me.<br><br>
