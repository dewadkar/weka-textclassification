            <b>Disclaimer:</b>  We don't own this car.  It was a rental for two weeks as our
Camry was being repaired.

This car has very few positive points, so I will get them out of the way first.

The Cavalier's greatest assets are it's responsive braking and acceleration.
It has ABS brakes and a 2.2 liter engine that performs well. Surprisingly,
the engine always sounds like it is struggling, even at slow speeds.
It has that tiny lawn mower engine sound.

The seats are comfortable enough. Even the back seat is OK given what you'd 
expect from a car this size.

<b>Now for the complaints.</b>

The quality of design and construction are severely lacking in this car.
The electric window controls are not on door, but on center console where
beverages can spill on them.

The power door locks jammed on the right front and rear doors when activated.
This couldn't be overcome manually either.  Trying to use the key in the door
from the outside and pulling up on the knob from the inside were both
fruitless in opening the door.  I was forced to ride home in the back seat
behind the driver.  This provided an opportunity to find another fault with
the vehicle.  All the windows were closed, but I kept heard the sound of
rushing wind as if something were open to the outside.  It must have been a
hole under the back seat for all I know.

The car has a very bumpy ride, even at 10-15 MPH.  It is very noisy as well.
We continually heard clunking sound as if the car were falling apart around us.
Are GM workers back to their old tricks of leaving tools in the door panels?
We didn't dare take it on the freeway.

The car feels smaller than it is, and it's a small car.  That is not good.
The dash seems to stretch out forever in front of you giving you quite a sloped
windshield.  This actually places the sun visor uselessly over your head.
Wear a baseball cap instead.  There is no gear selection display in the dash
forcing the driver to look down on the shifter to confirm the gears.  The
climate controls are not easily accessible.  You have to reach around the gear
shift to find them.  This can be dangerous in traffic.
Overall it is a poor layout.

The attempt at an ergonomic steering wheel is cute, but dangerous.  It has
normal thickness at the top, double thickness at 10:00 and 2:00, cute little 
thumb holes at 8:00 and 4:00, making cornering an exercise in fumbling for 
a grip.  It is especially unsuitable for people with small hands, carpal tunnel
syndrome or arthritis.

The parking brake is a real design of lunacy.  It isn't in the center console
where you would expect it (I guess they needed room for the window
controls!).  Instead it is mounted to the left of the console, against the
driver's right leg, and sticks up between the console and the seat when set.
Tell me how comfortable this is going to be for any trip of more than 5 minutes?

The door handles are another poor design.  They end in a depression in the door
which too easily catches trash.  Appropriate, though - the car is trash!

The low slung sporty design scrapes the nose on every gutter - probably why
it's falling apart.  This car is a loser all the way around.  Do yourself a
favor and get one of its competitors.
