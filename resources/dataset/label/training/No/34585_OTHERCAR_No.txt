            I bought this Saturn in the fall of 1997.  I went in looking for an older Honda, and ended up test driving this.  It was one of the more user friendly manual transmissions I had driven, and had a surprisingly smooth ride.  I was a student at the time, and it was the perfect car for me.

It had options added of Anti Lock Brakes (which were great) and cruise control. 

One of the first 'incidents' I had with the car was when an overweight friend of mine sat in the passenger side seat.  As we drove down the rode, I heard a crack, and his seat fell straight backwards.  I was later told by saturn that this part could be replaced for $130 (which I never did).  I normally never took passengers after that.

The other big cosmetic problem with it was the sunroof.  It leaked so bad I could have cried.  On a sunny day it was great, but on a rainy day my seats would get soaked.  I had tried to have it fixed, but to no avail.  Also, the inside part of the sunroof, that manually pulled back, fell apart.  

I had to replace the clutch within the first year I got it, which may have been in part due to my misuse of it.  I bought it with around 50,000 miles on it, so it could have been anything.

This car had FABULOUS gas mileage.  I made it 1100 miles, across country, on 2 tanks of gas (and the gas tank is maybe 10 gallons). 

All said, though, it was a truly reliable car.  The only complaints I have are cosmetic.  I hope that in years after 93, Saturn worked on making the body as nice as the rest of the car.  The cosmetic ineptitude of the car made me want to move on.
