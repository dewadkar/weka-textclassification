            UPDATE: In March 2002 I got rid of this clunker and got myself a 2002 Mitsubishi Galant. Check out my review of it if you're interested. I'm much happier now. :)

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 

I bought my Grand Am used. Mistake #1 probably. It was 2 years old, and still under warranty when I got it. That warranty came in useful...

Three months after I bought it, the nightmare began. It was making a chugging noise and stalling out. I took it into the Pontiac dealer to have it checked out. They couldn't find anything wrong, but suggested I have the 30,000 mile maintenance done since it was fast approaching that mark. I did that, and 3 days later I was stranded on the side of the road with the car. I had it towed in to the dealer, and they replaced a few things on a hunch - but still weren't able to find an exact problem. Two days later, when I had to have it towed in *again* they found the problem. A seal on the gas tank had more or less just dissolved itself and the pieces had gotten into the fuel system. The entire fuel system was replaced, and all was ok. 

A few weeks later I noticed this crazy squeaking and grinding noise when I turned the wheel. My mechanic friend said it sounded like the brakes. I took it into the shop again, where they showed me that all the rotors had rust on them. (This was likely a fault of the previous owner.) They told me that it was ok for now, but I'd need to have the rotors replaced in another 10,000 miles or so. 

A year later I noticed that my brakes were barely working... I had to have the entire brake system replaced, and the guy at the Midas I went to (the car was no longer under warranty) told me this was common with Grand Ams. Apparently, they have lots of brake problems. 

Less than a year after that the low coolant light came on. I was almost at 50,000 miles at this point, so it didn't really concern me. I purchased some Dex Cool (the recommended coolant) and filled it up. The next day, the low coolant light came on again. Terrified of being stuck in LA traffic with no coolant, I took it to a local mechanic. A day later he called to give me the news - there were so many things wrong with the car (despite my having regular maintenance done) that he even suggested I might want to try and sell it. $900 worth of repairs on the cooling system later (completely rusted through - I'd never put water in it, and I'd had it for three years by now), not to mention that the power steering system needed some work, and I still have the car. (The power steering issue seems to be common among Pontiacs altogether - not only did my mechanic tell me that, but my friends who have a Sunfire experienced the same problem.)

The horn quit working about 2 years ago, although for some reason if the car gets really hot (I recently had to drive out into the desert in 105 degree weather) it works temporarily. 

On top of all that, there are some basic complaints I've had with the design: There is no leg room in the front (I have a two door, so I don't expect it in the back.). The seatbelts on the two door version hit at the wrong place - I'm constantly having to explain the red marks on my neck. (And my mom - who's nearly a foot shorter than me - had the same issue.) The trunk opening is a good bit smaller thank the trunk's actual width, making it awkward to try and get larger objects that will fit in the trunk actually *into* the trunk. 

If you're looking for a car - check into others. I wouldn't recommend a Grand Am.
