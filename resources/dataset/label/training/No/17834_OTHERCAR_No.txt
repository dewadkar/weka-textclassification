            Call me crazy! I have owned four Blazers in the last decade. Two were 2.8 liter V-6's and two were 4.3 liter V-6. Both of the 2.8 liters (a '88 tahoe edition and a '91) had severe engine problems develop around 60,000 miles. The '88 blew a head gasket and dropped a ton of oil all over my driveway one night and the '91's engine siezed up because the serpentine belt that runs the fan that cools the engine broke while I was on the highway and the engine overheated.

I sincerely believe that many of the problems with the 2.8 liter engines arise from the fact that this is too much American steel to be hauled around by this tiny engine. In addition, throw in the extra weight of a four wheel drive differential and you are asking this little engine to blow up. 

A word to the wise for owners of cars that use serpentine belts (one belt to control the heating/AC, engine coolant, power steering, etc...), if you are ever driving and lose your power steering, it is a good sign that your serpentine belt has just broken and you had better STOP FAST! If you continue to drive, even for a short while, you risk overheating the engine and cracking the block.

After my 2.8 liter fiascos, I decided to try the 4.3 liter Vortec engine because several of my friends recommended theirs. I have been pleased as punch with this high performance engine. There is much more power and I haven't had ANY engine trouble with either of the Blazers with the Vortec.

I am still a big fan of the S-10 Blazers because of their versatility and their price, but anyone purchasing the Blazer should either skip the 2.8 and get the 4.3 OR get a good extended warranty because it will be in the shop.

With respect to the other aspects of the S-10 Blazers, be aware that the pre-1996 models drive like trucks. I had the opportunity to test-drive a 1999 model recently and the handling and steering is much smoother than the older body-style. In addition, Chevy's newer body style boasts a much more luxurious interior.

In summary, if you are looking to purchase an S-10 Blazer, avoid that 2.8 liter engine and opt for the 4.3. Depending on your needs and budget, I would also highly recommend the newer body style rather than the older.
