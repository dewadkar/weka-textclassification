            The sheer idea of owning a digital camera was one held by myself in high regard.  I never wanted to drop the cash to pick one up however.  Well about 4 months ago I was wandering around my local �screw you over with high prices� mega computer store chain, and I stumbled across a great deal for a little gadget known as the HP Photosmart 215.  Being the frugal Dutchman that I was, the price of 149.00 tickled my pallet.  So I purchased the shiny silver beast and took it back to my den.  I can now say that 8 bit graphics never looked so good.

<B>The Basics</b>

The camera itself is incredibly simple to use.  I�d wager to say that even a kindergartner could operate it without too much of a problem.  Granted the pictures may look similar to that of an authentic Divinchi, but hey, who am I too judge.  The package comes complete with a 4-MB storage card, the camera itself, the owners� manual, and the USB port connection.  You also receive a software package for unloading your creations on the world.

<B>Now Showing</b>

There are only 4 major buttons on the camera itself.  The two switches located on the back of the camera operate as follows.  The first is the power/recap button.  This button has three settings: center the switch for power off, flip the switch up to turn the beast on, and toggle the switch down to recap/review the pictures you have already taken.  The second switch has one function.  The 215 has an LCD view finder located in the back for picture review and for aiming purposes.  If a certain time period elapses, the camera goes into standby mode.  This switch allows you to refresh the LCD display and take the camera out of standby.

Located on the top of this contraption is the �shutter� button.  I�m still stuck in the era of manual cameras, so I still refer to taking a picture as snapping the shutter.  Pretty simple to understand here: point, aim, click and voila! Instant visual presentation for your viewing enjoyment.  I might add presented in a magnificent 2x2 inch box.

The final button is located on the rear, and no it�s not a hemorrhoid.  This �gear�, as I�ll call it, is probably the most important button on the camera.  This is where you adjust the settings for your pictures.  Before you snap the shot, you can push the gear in, this will bring up a menu of options.  The first option is quality.  Here you can choose the photo quality you would like to take your pictures in: Basic, Fine, or Super Fine.  From here we progress to the flash button.  From this designated local you can choose to set your flash to automatically adjust, reduce for redeye, use flash fill, or turn the flash off.  Next in the line up is the auto focus.  Choose weather or not you want the camera to use its auto focus feature for taking your prized nature photo.  Second to last is one of the only promising features offered by this camera, a self-timer.  I shouldn�t need to explain this one to you, as it is fairly self-evident.  Last, and certainly not least (or so I�m told that�s how the adage goes), is the digital zoom.    You can choose to shoot in standard, or crank this sucker up to 2x view.  So many options, so little time.

There is also an option here to adjust the camera settings.  This is nothing to imperative to the operation of the camera.  Just a few minor setting such as date/time, language, formatting the memory card, and setting your instant review features.  The reason I called this last button a gear is simple; it turns like a wheel.  This is how you move from option to option in the setup menu, and also how you move from picture to picture when you are using the recap feature.

<B>The Verdict</B>

After using this monstrosity for about 3 months now, I can safely say I wish I�d saved my money for the bigger and better model.  The pictures, even when set at super fine quality, are grainy at best.  Yes I know that most digital cameras have shoddy pictures, but the super fine here doesn�t match the basic I�ve seen on many other cameras.  Try using this camera inside, you�ll regret it.  The auto-focus and auto-flash features combine pathetically at best to give you a mixed color, and somewhat blurry picture.  On the latest picture of my cat, I could barely discern him from a cute cuddly feline, to a dropped smore on my couch.  Anyone got a stick?  I assure you that the black, brown, and white color mixture was superb.

The weakest factor in all of this is the battery life.  The batteries in this camera drain faster than a rave in LA when the doors are rammed down.  I�ve spent enough in batteries in 3 months to buy a top of the line camera 3 times over.  Literally one shoot, roughly 36 pictures on basic mode, and you�ll be replacing the batteries.  Now if the camera only took two batteries, that would be a little more tolerable.  But this sucker takes 4.  Have you seen the price of batteries lately? I rest my case

If I haven�t made my stance on this blatantly clear by now, you must have taken a snapshot of this review with a 215.  I hope someday  that you decipher it.
