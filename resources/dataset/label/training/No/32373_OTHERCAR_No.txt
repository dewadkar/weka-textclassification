            I ordered my 1999 Navigator to replace my 1997 Expedition which I was really impressed with. What I loved about the Expedition was its space, comfort and above all reliability. It was the 1st year they were out and I NEVER took it back to the dealer and I drove it pretty hard for 31K miles in 24 months (lease). Frankly, Ford converted me with that one truck. The Navigator represented a vehicle I already liked with even better features. 

I custom ordered it 1999 1/2 (AWD/300hp InTech V8) to get the bench rear seat as I needed the seating for adults. The 3rd seat is great for kids but torture for adults. Its a complete pain to remove too so if your not a reasonably strong man you probably can't do it by yourself. My truck has dual A/C, Motorola phone (rare), Alpine sound syst, heated seats, and all other options except moonroof because @ the time it was incompatible with dual A/C. 

The first year went great. We had a massive midwest snowstorm and I felt complete confidence. The 4 wheel (high) works great. the 4WD low range will get you unstuck from just about anything. I towed several times and felt very little difference from the engine. The engine (300hp) is just enough for this truck but you know it's always working to pull 6000lbs when you have 2 passengers. Odd that towing doesn't affect it much. Ford has this towing thing down. The air suspension is much improved over the Expedition and levels the truck out when loaded with people/cargo/tow. The ride is surprisingly smooth. Handling is pretty bad so get ready to hang on because seats aren't made to hold you in. Front seats adjust well but really lack support for long drives (over 4 hours). Steering feel is nonexistent but the truck responds consistently so there are no surprises. Braking power is adequate and resists fade pretty well which again is essential for towing. Pedal feel is not so great however. ABS works as it should. If you respect the mass you're moving you will never spin or roll this truck....otherwise read one of the other reviews on here. 

The interior finish is a mix of nice wood, soft and so far fairly durable leather, cheap plastics and so-so build quality. Overall an impressive look but little cover trim pieces have come off at the rate of one per year. I find them and say hmmmm where does this go. The exterior is decently painted, cheaply trimmed, so-so build quality and again an overall impressive "look". The effect back then was a little like the Hummer is today because there were not many luxo SUVs . 

Frankly, the build quality screams Ford F150. That's especially disappointing when I paid $45K for the truck and because I owned the Expedition b4, I could see the feeble effort to build this truck any better. It's really just a materials upgrade package from the Expedition and a new motor. I would describe the overall build effect as "unengineered". Kind of like having Queer Eye come over and redo your grandpa's basic home. No matter what they do the house isn't going to make it into Architectural Digest (nor him into GQ). 

Mileage climbed from 7.9mpg (4 real folks) to 12.7 where it is today. My driving is 80/20 city/highway. Range is about 380-390 miles per tank and what a whopper to fill it up and remember premium fuel only. I've paid $65 for a fill-up once! But I knew this wasn't a hybrid Honda so I'm not complaining too much. Insurance is reasonable at $500/bi-annual for suburban Chicago. 

First problem was I had to replace a defective tire (ContiTrac 17") where I was given a pro-rated credit based on tread depth so it cost me about $80 but because I had maintenance included that was really the only money I spent during the first 3 years. Dealer service was good but not at the level of Lexus. Kind of like being a VIP at the Holiday Inn and paying Four Seasons prices. 

At about 2 yrs the drivers heated seat coil went out (under warranty). I had a minor accident and had to replace the passenger fender and was surprised to find out it costs only $600 for the huge thing (covered by insurance). Another tire went bad (pro-rated again). Brake job @ 30K miles $289 from the dealer w/coupon. 

At 3yrs the transmission failed. Roadside assistance came and that part was a positive experience. The warranty bill to Ford was $3200! Car was out for 10 days. The driver's heated seat coil went out again. The next month  the steering box failed. It feels like a wobbly wheel but all the lug nuts are tight. I bought the extended warranty after the steering box failed ($850) and that should have been my hint (duh). Made the first claim on it at 55K miles when the fuel pump went out. Still had to pay $170 for the fuel filter (filters/belts/hoses/tires never covered by any warranty). Drivers heated seat coil went out yet again. 

Otherwise other electronics are holding up extremely well. 
Phone works flawlessly. Wood, leather and carpeting are in good shaped. No rattles or squeaks which is a surprise after everything. Tailgate drums a little. Interior painted plastic pieces are not worn or scuffed. Paint finish is holding on nicely. I noticed that the grey plastic trim on the rear bumper step gouges very easily. Different material than running boards even tho it looks the same. 

In the end I love the overall look of this truck but I can't live with the drama. As a truck it performs incredibly well hauling, towing, snow duty,etc. I'm disappointed because I paid a premium price for a total luxury vehicle and only got half of one. Ford lost me again with this one. Looking at Lexus LX470 now. Better resale on that one too.
