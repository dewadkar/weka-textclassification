            I have owned a Chevrolet Cavalier 2000 for 1 1/2 yrs. I have had nothing but problems with it & can only say it is good on gas. I had numerous problems recurring from the brakes, driver's door window jammed shut during 100F heat,defrost humming, door panel falling apart, etc. But not just once, several times for most of these problems. Of course, all is covered under warranty, but who has the time to continuously drop off your car, arrange alternative transportation & take some time off work to do all this? When I contacted GM Canada to address the concerns, their Customer Service Rep suggested as GM's final resolution that I sell my car. Well you know what, I would but why should I be the one to lose out on the car value because the car has never been what I thought I bought! How is this fair? The warranty is up after 3 yrs of ownership & who knows what will happen then! I still can't believe that GM's resolution to the problem was to sell my car. It is obvious they have no good intentions toward providing total customer satisfaction & they think that if one customer is not satisfied that it is not a huge deal. Well how many people are reading this right now and now know why they should not buy a GM vehicle regardless of which model because the very same thing could happen to them? GM has better quality vehicles but I bet their delivery of service is just the same.
