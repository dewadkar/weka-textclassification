            I rented this car from Hertz on a recent trip to Chicago and we had one 3 months ago in Georgia.  Both times I was very uncomfortable in this car.

On the earlier trip, we were very crowded with our 3 children.  My husband had to drive the entire trip because there was no room for him in the back seat with two carseats- in fact, it was very squished for me and I'm a very small person.  Our oldest daughter had to sit in the front seat in her booster seat.  I wasn't happy about it even though she is legally able to sit with an airbag.   Our luggage was quite a squeeze but with good maneuvering, my husband was able to fit an Emmaljunga stroller, 2 rather large suitcases, two (very) small suitcases and some miscellaneous items around the car.    

On my second trip with this car, it was my baby and myself.  There were good anchor points for his tethered rear facing carseat so he was safe in the back seat.   My one small suitcase fit just fine.  :-)  

I was in pain during and after driving this car.  The steering wheel felt small and unstable.  The cruise control was erratic and not easy to adjust.  Instead of just using the cruise button to accelerate, I had to use the gas pedal and then click and often re-click the buttons to set my new speed.  

The instability of steering was dangerous for me.  Since I was driving with an infant, I was distracted a couple of times and had to hand him something in the back seat.  Normally I have no problem doing this on the open road.  In this car I almost drove off the road.  It happened more than once.  I don't know if it was a tire problem or steering wheel problem, but it was very scary.

The seat was fantastically uncomfortable.  I drive a lot with no problems but driving for less than an hour in this car hurt.  My lower back and shoulders seized up and my wrists were in agony.  I had pressure on so many pressure points that everything started to hurt.  I have never been so happy to turn over a rental car.
