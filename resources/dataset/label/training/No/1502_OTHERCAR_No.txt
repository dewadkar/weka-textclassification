            My Saturn was purchased for me as a birthday present from my grandparents.  We decided on the Saturn because it was inexpensive, attractive, and economical.
Since it was purchased, I have had 2 alternator bearings that had to be replaced, a battery die, 2 sets of brakes, water in the brake fluid (which caused my breaks to go out while I was driving down the highway)and the service engine soon light has been on more times that I care to remember. 
It is a good car to drive.  The ride would be very quiet, except the antenna screws in and it looses itself just enough to rattle and every time you make a turn, you can hear it. I love the way it rides and I love how it handles; however, I cannot afford to be fixing a car every other week.  I also have friends who have had the same problem, and a local alternator shop swears that Saturns just do not have good alternators. 
All in all I like my little car and would probably buy a Saturn again because 1 bad experience with it doesn't mean that they all are going to be bad, I would just make sure that I got a good warranty with the company at the time of purchase. <br><br>
