            we purchased the 95 model with the 3300 engine. While the larger v-6 provided plenty of power it was as expected a little dissappointing in mileage. We have had no serious problems with the car it runs well at 120k miles. However, we have had troubles with the elect windows and door locks the  wires to the rear defrost and the elect antenea. All minor problems that did not take a lot of expense to fix. Currently we have the idiot lights going off from time to time and have been told it is just the sensors and no problem with the car. So it has been a reliable car and no real problems yet but a major source of inconvenience in having to deal with the constant bs problems.<br><br>
