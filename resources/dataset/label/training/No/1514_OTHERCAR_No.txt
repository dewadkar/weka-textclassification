               I bought this vehicle because of the &quot;Different Kind of Car&quot; slogan and I wanted to buy an American made car. I had heard how this was going to be the import fighter.

 Well with great disappointment to me it is not and will not be. I used this car for everything it was the only car I had at the time. I had a new baby, new job and a wife that stayed home with the baby. So the car got a lot of miles put on it. It currently has 138,000 miles on it.

 The first problem I had is when the power window on the driver side went dead. Then the battery went dead. The alternator went next. 

Then the big one happened on October 1, 1999. That was the day my second child was born and the day I was coming home from work after working the night shift. I noticed that my temp gauge was running hotter than normal. When I pulled into my driveway I noticed a substance that can only be described as a milk shake oozing out from under my hood.

 I took my car to a trusted family mechanic because I did not trust the Saturn dealership in our town. He found out that I had a cracked cylinder head. He also told me that he called Saturn and they said that it was a defective cylinder head. So my mechanic told me to call Saturn to see if they would fix it under warranty. Saturn of Bakersfield, The Saturn Corp., and a Saturn District advisor told me that Saturn would cover the defect up to 100,000 miles and I was assured that this was very generous of them. 

At the time I was not able to take advantage of their offer. Due to the fact I was way over their 100,000-mile warranty period with 107,000. I went round and round and to this day I am emailing them to give me the refund I am deserved. It ended up costing me $2000.00 to fix my car. Iï¿½m still paying on that loan. So really it is costing me a lot more than $2000.00.

 I do not recommend this manufacturer's products. They do not stand behind the vehicles they sell. At present time my transmission is going out. It shudders out of first into second and my car vibrates badly I can only imagine that it is probably bad motor mounts.

 In the beginning I remember when Saturn did care about their customers. I remember on the news one night about this guy who had paint peeling off his rear bumper and the President of Saturn was online while this guy was telling his story. The Saturn President told him to take his car to the nearest Saturn dealership and they would fix it for free. That was the Saturn I bought into not the Saturn of today.

 This Saturn was supposed to be the import fighter instead they are possibly in talks to have Honda start supplying their engines. So much for an American import fighter I think KIA would be a better import fighter oh wait their foreign also.

 On October 1, 1999 Saturn of Bakersfield contacted me to say that they had the color of LS2 that I wanted. I had already taken out a loan for it and was ready to buy. Luckily my SL1 broke down or I would probably be stuck with two headaches. 

I know that if you own a Saturn you will go on the defensive. At least here other people out at yahoo Saturn auto chat or at saturnexposed.com Also this experience drove me to buy my first foreign vehicle. I am know the proud owner of a Toyota Sienna LE. Good luck if you decide to buy a Saturn.<br><br>
