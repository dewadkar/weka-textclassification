            I'll be the first to defect from the long list of Sienna lovers... But first some background. I've been a loyal Toyota owner since 1989. I've owned numerous Toyota vehicles including 2WD Truck, 4WD X-Cab Truck, 4WD 4runner, Celica GTS, Avalon. Two of the above vehicles are still in the family and running strong with mileage ranging from 130k to 160k. I'm a firm believer in Toyota reliability. I also own a 2000 Toyota Tundra which has been totally problem free since I bought it less than 7k miles ago. The Sienna, however, is the exception.

<b>I really didn't much consider other mini-vans before I decided to purchase the Sienna.</b> (I looked at the specs on the Honda, but didn't think seriously enough about it to test drive one.) I have family members that own and absolutely LOVE their Sienna. I've been impressed with their 2000 Sienna also, and that's mostly what sold me on it, aside from my history with Toyota.

<b>Unfortunately, my Sienna has had a number of problems since I bought it new about 2000 miles ago.</b> These problems are currently being addressed with both Toyota (Corporate) and the Dealer, but so far, nothing has been fixed to my satisfaction. I honestly believe that 95% of the vans that Toyota sells are probably problem-free for a long time. Unfortunately, my van is not one of those, which makes it extremely difficult for me to recommend this vehicle to anyone, and do so with a high level of confidence.

<b>First</b>, the biggest problem I've had with my Sienna is with the power door. Frequently, it will close only to suddenly re-open and close itself again several times. Finally is just returns to an open position and you get to try it again. Several times, the door appeared to close properly until I started to back up. Then, the power door light would flash and a buzzer would go off. I would put the van back into park and try opening and closing the door again. Nothing seems to help. But, the door only exhibits this behavior about 40% of the time. (FYI... There is a TSB that addresses problems with the power-door computer.) This problem is dangerous and downright scary because I'm afraid that my small children could get their arm pinched in the "runaway" door.

The <b>second</b> major problem I have is with the front doors. Both driver and passenger side doors do not unlatch properly and require an extreme amount of force to be opened. When they do open, they open with a loud "pop". You have to pull on the handle so hard to get the door to release that you can see the metal door panel flexing. The dealer thusfar been unable to correct this problem.

The <b>third</b> major problem is that when you're backing the van up with your foot partially on the brake, all of a sudden you hear/feel a loud "THUMP" coming from the rear of the vehicle. The first time this happened, I though my wife had backed into a kid on a bike or something! It was really scary. Fortunately, we hadn't hit anything... It feels like the rear brakes suddenly grab without warning or driver intervention when backing up. Fortunately, the problem doesn't happen all the time - it's totally at random. (That makes it even worse though, because you don't know if you hit something or if it's just your van acting up.)

The <b>fourth</b> item that is a great annoyance is the Sienna windshield. The sides of the windshield are distorted - starting about 8-10 inches from the edge of the windshield, there are vertical wavy spots in the glass. If you look into this area while you are driving, the scenery seems to move up and down. This can easily cause a headache for some people and is very annoying. Your windshield should be free from distortions. The service department has replaced the windshield, but the replacement windshield was worse than the first.

<b>Other problems</b> I have with the van include various fit and finish items such a rearview (compass/temperature) mirror that continually vibrates while you're driving, and a sun visors that will not stay positioned when unlatched. If you have the visor pushed to the left of your head to block the sun while driving, if you turn a corner the visor will swing around and smack you in the head. This is only funny the first time!

<b>Another complaint</b> about this vehicle are the choice of poor-quality Firestone tires as a stock tire on the LE. (If you purchase the XLE or opt for the "factory" alloy wheel upgrade, you get a larger tire that is a different model and seems to have a smoother ride. Unfortunately, in many areas of the country, vans are "packaged" at the port. The alloy wheels that come on your van may look the same as the Toyota alloys, but don't come with the upgraded tires. Buyer beware!) These stock Firestone 205/70R/15 tires are loud on the highway, and transmit every bump into the van, in the city. The ride is much more rough than you would expect from a van in this price range. This bothers some people more than others. This is simply a quality complaint and is definitely subjective. Some people simply have no complaints about the stock tires. However, I'd strongly suggest driving the XLE before settling for the stock tires on the LE. <b>At a mere $475 for the optional AW package on the LE, you get Toyota alloy wheels and upgraded tires, which are larger and higher quality, and are smooth and give less road noise.</b>

<b>Likes:</b> The van is designed well. There is a lot of interior space, the AC is excellent (important here in Texas), the new JBL stereo system is good sounding (for a stock system), the materials seem higher quality than most vans - i.e. thick fabric, durable carpet, etc.). I also like the excellent crash-test results. I feel that my family is safe driving around in the Sienna. That's a big plus! I think the seats are fairly comfortable and I don't share the same complaint that many people have about the seats. The keyless entry is really nice, as is the remote power door and dual sliding doors. I also really like the smooth engine and transmission. The van seems to have more than enough power.

<b>There is a lot to like about this van! It's just a shame that their build quality appears to be slipping.</b> This many problems on one vehicle is definitely out of character for Toyota. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come... Buyer beware! Check the vehicle over COMPLETELY before buying. Report any problems to the dealer immediately. Don't expect that just because it's a Toyota that it will be problem-free. My experience is proof that this isn't always the case.

Good Luck!

-----------------------------

<b>Update 08-15-2001</b> - After submitting a written complain to Toyota about my vehicle, a case was opened up with my regional area to solve the problems with my van. The first time I took it in to the dealer to have the problems addressed, none of the problems were addressed except for the windshield, which was poorly replaced with a worse windshield. The dealer claimed that the rest of my problems were normal characteristics of the vehicle. When I complained further to the regional Toyota customer service department and indicated my intent to have the vehicle bought back under the Texas lemon law, they took me seriously. They sent a specialist out to look at the problems with my van, and talk to me about the problems, as well as look at other vans to compare. Indeed, most of my problems could not be observed on other vans with the exception of the windshield and sun visors. 

After a week of the van being in the shop, nearly all of the problems were resolved. The power door now functions normally thanks to Toyota replacing half a dozen parts or so, the front door latches and handles were replaced on both sides, completely resolving that problem, the rearview mirror was replaced with one that didn't vibrate, the windshield was replaced (again) with one that did not have distortions, and the shift-lock cable was lubricated to make the shifter work more smoothly (though it still seems to "stick" periodically).

<b>The problems that cannot be resolved are:</b>
- Thunk noise from rear of vehicle while backing up. This is apparently "normal" function of the ABS system and is more prevalent when you're backing down an incline. Many previous Toyota Vehicles that I've owned with ABS never exhibited this problem, nor did they exhibit the "groaning" noise caused by the ABS self-test when you start the vehicle. Nevertheless, Toyota claims that this is normal and they are aware of it.
- Sun Visors: The only Toyota vehicle I've ever witnessed having sun visors that are loose and swing around when unlatched is the Sienna. According to Toyota, this is "normal", and the same problem existed on every new Sienna on the lot.
- Tires: If you live in the Gulf States area and you want your vehicle to have a decent ride and lower road noise, your only option is to buy the XLE, which comes with larger tires that give a smoother ride and are much quieter. The Toyota options such as the AW package are NOT available to buyers in my area. Toyota charges $475 for the AW package and includes factory alloy wheels and upgraded tires. Gulf States Toyota (the distributor) charges $679 for a set of generic alloy wheels only. 

<i>Beware of other required "packages" often added by the distributors. These are shown in the right-hand section of the sticker, and are non-genuine Toyota options. They are usually expensive and replace genuine Toyota options at a premium. They add things like Road side assistance, Road Hazard warranties, non-Toyota security systems, non-Toyota leather upholstery, wood trim, pin stripes, etc. </i>

<b>In conclusion,</b> I am satisfied that all the problems that my vehicle came with that could be repaired, are now repaired. I think the dealership did a good job repairing the problems, though I wish they would have repaired them the first time I brought the vehicle in, rather than making me escalate my problems to Toyota corporate for resolution. <i>(I was without my van for about two weeks total while they worked on the problems.)</i> The Customer Service manager at the dealership was very understanding and a real pleasure to deal with. Gulf States Toyota is another issue entirely. While I give the dealership thumbs up for doing everything they could to rectify the factory defects, I give Gulf State Toyota a big huge thumbs down for their apathy about my problems with this brand new van. Indeed, the only thing they seemed to want to do was the bare minimum required to keep them out of a "lemon-law buyback" situation. Customer satisfaction was not a priority.

Would I recommend the Sienna now? Well, Maybe. I still believe that most of the Siennas sold are relatively problem-free. I believe you have a better chance of a Sienna being a reliable vehicle long-term than their competition. But I have to wonder if Toyota isn't becoming sloppy with their quality control...? If they are, the long-term effects could be very damaging to the company. If Toyota's competitors had better track-records, I might have considered them instead. As quality among Toyota's competitors increases, Toyota is going to need to rely more and more on customer loyalty - which is a very fragile thing. Selling flawed products and then putting the customer through lots of frustration in their attempts to get their problems fixed, is not going to help them in this area. Neither is trusting their "precious customers" to their regional distributors to handle (poorly).
