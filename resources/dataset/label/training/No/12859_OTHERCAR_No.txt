            I guess I am a victim of this technological age where I hear the word digital and I think it has got to be good!   I should have checked further...

<b>What did I want?</b>
I wanted a <i>digital</i> camera.  Something simple and small that would be easy to use.  A camera that could take pictures and then I have them instantly available on my computer.  I could sell junk on Ebay!  I could send daily pics of my little darlin to all my family!  I could put real pictures on my web site taken TODAY!

Well, that is well and good but I learned my lesson the hard way.  Digital does not equal <b>good</b>.

<b>What did I get?</b>
I bid and won 3 of these cameras at an online auction.  MSRP is $129.00 and I saw this camera listed for that amount on many retailers websites.  I won these for $46.00 each and thought I got a GREAT DEAL!  I wanted one for myself and the other two were Christmas presents.

I ripped open the box the minute these cameras arrived.  I could not WAIT to try it out.  <i>Especially</i> since I planned to give 2 away as gifts.  I wanted to be able to give instructions Christmas day to the recipients.  I struggled with the battery compartment cover and finally got the battery installed.   The camera is just a &quot;point and shoot&quot;.  One beep tells you it has taken the picture.  It also has a 10 second timer if you want to run in front of it and take one of yourself.  That's all two buttons, simple no?  After taking 10 shots of my toddler I ran to the computer and downloaded the software. The software was easy to install and somewhat intuitive to use.  I needed to plug the cord that came with the camera into the computer.  I had an available serial port and I had no conflicts with it when I attempted to download the pictures.  This camera does not save to a disk.

The camera has &quot;4 Mbit internal memory&quot; and will hold 24 shots.  I thought that was pretty good.  I waited for the images to pop up.  What I got was a teeny tiny, itsy bitsy thumbnail. No problem I thought, it's a <i>thumbnail</i>.

Then you can save your thumbnail into your gallery in a variety of formats including jpg, ivue, tiff, bmp, and pict.  I chose a few different formats for testing purposes.  After your picture is saved it shows up in the &quot;gallery&quot;.  On my 21&quot; screen monitor the gallery picture is about 1 1/4&quot;l x 1&quot;h.  Bad news.  That is the BEST the picture will EVER look.  Make that puppy ANY bigger and you begin to lose quality.  To make matters worse, when you launch the picture into the software provided it blows it up to a huge size and you can NOT recognize anything in the picture.  The image is grainy, blurry, and broken up into millions of what I can only describe as &quot;squares&quot;.  What was going on???

I must have done something wrong.  I checked the manual, nope.  I checked my computer, nope.  I tried other file formats and saving strategies, nope.  I tried some of the softwares' image editing.  Finally, I called technical support.  ARGGH, turns out the number listed in the manual doesn't handle support for this camera anymore.  No, they did not know the new number either.  

Being the resourceful gal that I am I found the customer service department for Vivitar on the web.  I filled out the eform and they responded by the next morning.

Bottom line?  The resolution on the camera is only 160 x 120 pixels.  It is a <b>LOW RESOLUTION</b> camera.  Period, end of story.  I was FURIOUS!  I couldn't imagine a company like Vivitar would market such an incredibly inferior product!!  Especially for $129.00.  As far as I was concerned this was just <b>junk</b>!  Even the tiny gallery picture was so small you can't really DO anything with it.  Customer service wrote back and said the camera was for &quot;kids&quot; to use with the software.  If they thought that the pictures as interpreted by the software were acceptable they they have some serious problems over there.

Another problem is that the viewfinder does not line up at all with the lens.  I have several pictures of my cat with no head, my son with no head, and test shots of various objects and lighting that are off by about 25%.  Just ducky.

Oh jeez.  These were to be Christmas presents!! Now I have to drop everything and go shopping because I can't give this &quot;digital camera&quot; to my mom and brother.  I played with the pictures a little more and found that if I launched a jpg directly into my browser (not using the LivePix software) I got a 3&quot;lth x 2.5&quot;w picture.  The quality still isn't that good but it was good enough for me to decide that I could give these as gifts after all.  Limited use but they could have some fun.

A few days after Christmas I talked to my mom.  She was afraid to touch it because it was &quot;digital&quot; therefore &quot;complicated&quot;.  I had to tell her my story of woe and hoped that she didn't think her present was too lame.  I honestly didn't feel good about them.  I found myself explaining the best way to get a somewhat reasonable picture out of this camera...which wasn't how I &quot;pictured&quot; my cool gift idea.  The kicker was that my brother gave us a $150.00 gift certificate to buy a digital camera!!  Oh the irony....

I learned my lesson.  Digital does not equal good.  Price does not equal good.  Homework and knowing your stuff equals good.

How many times am I gonna have to learn that?? &lt;G&gt;

Thanks for reading!<br><br>
