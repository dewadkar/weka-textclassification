            This is one of my buddies car, I do the mechanical work on it. He got the car for free w/42,000 miles (for graduation) and basically just wants to make it a nice driver. We've put in springs and sway bars and replaced the cooling system. Other than that, at 125,000 it's in great shape and drives nice for what it is. It really like it's regular service (oil/transmission fluid changes, etc.) and runs smooth and quiet. I don't like the fact that it's carbuerated, FI would raise the power and effienciency of this vehicle into something fun, not mention removing needless complexity from the engine bay. It's fine for urban driving and parking, but freeway driving before the suspension upgrades was quite taxing. Turing radius is fairly tight. Up front seating provides great visiblity (typical for a Japanese sedan) and the interior is clean and functional. I find seats a little on the cardboard side.
