            We bought our Town &amp; Country LXI after having owned a wonderfully reliable Caravan for 10 years.  We thought we'd upgrade - what a mistake!  At 29,000 miles, this car has had three blow-outs (all on the highway), the rack and pinion replaced, the a/c system replaced, the window wiper system replaced and the brake pads replaced.  

The vehicle does not handle well.  It is all over the road (almost like skating) at highway speeds over 60mph.  This adds a decided thrill to all our long distance trips.  There is little or no sound insulation - the wind noise inside the car would lead you to believe that you are driving through a hurricane.  Our luggage rack rattles at speeds over 60mph.  The dealer claims there's nothing to be done about it.

I believe that ours is probably an errant lemon in an otherwise decent line.  However, the dealer has been impossible and continues to insist that there's nothing wrong with our car.

Therefore, I would recommend this vehicle only if:
1.  you are a gambler - if you do get the lemon, you're stuck with it, there will be no response from your dealer;
2.  you have unlimited resources to fix the problems until they get so bad that it becomes overwhelmingly apparent that it should be covered under warranty (we spent over $750 on the steering before the rack &amp; pinion gave out altogether),
3.  you own other cars which you can drive while this one is in the shop,
4.  you don't work and have the time to spend taking this car to and from the shop.
