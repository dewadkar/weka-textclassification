              I considered the Jetta because it had a sporty yet functional appearance.  I purchased the automatic gl 4cyl model new in 1999.  The seats are appealing to the eye but extremely uncomfortable. The transmission is slow to respond and there is a significant 3 second delay to shift from reverse to drive; there is also a noticeable jerky response when it does finally &quot;catch&quot;. Mechanics at VW claim, &quot;the transmission is functioning to specs&quot;. In other words, the car was designed poorly. The driver's side window leaks during rainy days. And there is a loose rattling sound in the passenger-side dashboard, VW mechanics can't seem to locate the source. 
  A lemon? Perhaps. Though I've spoken to a few Jetta owners who think otherwise. My advice is to consider, research and then consider again before buying a Jetta!<br><br>
