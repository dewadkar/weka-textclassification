            I must first apologize to anyone who bought one of these cars after reading my initial review.  For the first 4 months I owned this car it was wonderful but I have since changed my opinion and here's why.

After only owning it for 5 months the distributor went out on it while I was 7 months pregnant no less and left me stranded on the highway.  Then around 8 months while I was out of town with my newborn visiting family, a tumbler in the ignition was defective and I couldn't even get my key in it.  The entire ignition had to be replaced and I was stranded once again, but this time was 6 hours away from home!  THEN, after about 11 months, the computer/electrical system went out and left me stranded AGAIN forcing me to walk the 1/2 mile left to home carrying my baby.  

I have less than 8,000 miles on this car and as far as I am concerned it is a piece of crap.  When it works, it's great but for a car that is less than a year old and has already had to have 3 major components replaced, I am not at all happy with it.  I am looking into the lemon law as the dealership I am leasing it from has been no help at all and has shown no interest in resolving the problem.  I hope no one bought one of these after reading my initial review because I take back every good thing I have ever said about this hunk of junk.


(Original Review)

This is the first "family" car my husband and I have purchased.  We were going to buy a Nissan Sentra but after looking at both we decided that we would get a lot more car for not much more money.

Among the many features available we opted for the LXE package which included power windows, power door-locks, CD/cassette player stereo system with 6 speakers, security system, cruise control, rear fold down seats, chrome hubcaps, etc.

We have always heard that Nissans were extremely reliable and we knew we would be making a great investment in buying one.  

The Sentras although reasonable, were a little too small.  The Altima is in between a Sentra & Maxima.  It gives you more room with all the little features we all want but for a lot less than a Maxima.  It handles so well and what impressed the most was the power it had for a 4 cylinder engine.  The salesman explained to us that Nissan has changed the way the engines are designed to give you more horsepower even with a smaller engine.  I no longer feel like I am "chugging" to get on the interstate.  My Altima is fast and handles very smoothly.  It even handles speed bumps and railroad tracks like they're nothing.  It has dual airbags and a very nice interior.

And to any parents who might be interested in buying one, I highly recommend it.  We are expecting our first child soon and we were impressed with the built in child seat anchors on both rear seats.  Also, the rear seats fold down which will come in very handy when we have to transport the baby's stroller, etc.

I absolutely love my Altima and recommend it to anyone.  Make sure to ask your dealer about incentives because when we bought ours (6/00) they were offering some nice deals from Nissan.
