            Just to let you know I owned a 1989 Grand Voyager and LOVED it.  I had very little problems and it went 120,000 miles before I bought another Grand Voyager.  My 1996 Grand Voyager has been nothing but problems. One month I need to replace some parts in the transmission to the tune of $1,000 the next month the rods blew in the transmission and I need a new one.  The dealership was good about this and gave me a huge discount but I couldn't drive it for some while.  I have a short in the electrical system somewhere that cannot be found.  Some days the speedometer doesn't work, the break light flashes all the time and windows refuse to go up for a time. The cover for the lights in the hatch are constantly falling off.  The covers on the screws on the doors have popped off may times and some of them are now missing.  <br><br>
