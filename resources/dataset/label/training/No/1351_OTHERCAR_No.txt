            My 4x4 3-door extended cab 1999 Silverado has:  lots of power; good looks; reasonable gas mileage; excellent handling; and ample interior space.  However, at 30,000 miles and purchased new about one year ago, the Warranty has been put through the test.  

1. The rear brake disk had to be replaced since Chevrolet realized the    disc had to be larger in order to stop this big vehicle.  That was the    beginning of endless trip to the dealership.  
2. Sliding window had to be replaced due to water leaks.  
3. Ashtray replaced (paint peeled off).  
4. Computer has been &quot;updated&quot; over 3 times to update the shifting, etc... 
5. Door hinges squeaking terribly, passenger side, which is hardly used. 
6. Brake Master cylinder defective. Replaced at 12,000 miles.  
7. Steering shaft - Upper sphere and lower steering shaft replaced.  
8. Pads glazed, rear brake pads, replaced again. 
9. Daylight running passenger side lights replaced twice in 2 weeks time.
10.Paint peeling on hood. 

All these items have been replaced/repaired since truck was purchased in October '98. Considering this was a brand new vehicle, and quite costly, it is very hard for me to be delighted at owning this Silverado, my 2nd Chevrolet.  

My neighbors and co-workers actually make fun of me and my truck:
  &quot;That Chevrolet spends more time at the dealer than it does with you&quot;. Since it goes to the dealership at least once or twice a month since it was purchased.  

Was this truck built after the &quot;strike&quot; ended or just before?  Will never know.

There is another item which no solutions have been found for:  windshield fogs up even though you have it set on vent.  We still have to figure that out.  

I understand that all the changes took place with the new 1999 but that the 2000 model has been pretty much debugged!  Considering that my truck has been customized with after market wheels, rims, and many other items, it is not practical to trade for a 2000 model. 

It is very disappointing to experience all these problems with a new truck, and I cannot say for sure that I would purchase another Chevrolet. However, they are machines, man-made, and nothing is built as it used to be.  

For the past 2 weeks, no new problems.  No guarantee this &quot;good trend&quot; will last.  Will keep you informed though!
