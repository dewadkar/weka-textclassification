            I purchased my Malibu from the Chevrolet dealer in February 1997.  I had many problems with the ABS (anti-lock brake) indicator light comming on while driving.  I was informed to stop the car and restart the engine to reset the computer so the ABS light would go out.  I lost control of the car one day at a red light and ended up sliding sideways to stop the car.  I took the car into the dealership several times to correct the problem.  The dealer eventually replaced the entire braking system at 10,000 miles.  This was all during the first six months I owned the vehicle.  By the time the warranty ran out, I had the braking system, the front end control arms including bushings and valve cover gaskets replaced by the warranty. Also, about a week after purchasing the vehicle, the rear speaker covers  warped and were replaced by the dealer.

It is now August 2002, the vehicle has 45,000 miles.  Very low miles.  I have been having problems with the ABS light comming on for some time.  I was told by another dealer that it would be very had to diagnose the ABS light problem unless the light was stayed on all the time.  

Yesterday, the ABS light came on while driving then the AC quit cooling, the Airbag light came on and the gauges went haywire.  I stopped the car and tried to restart it and it would not start.  I was not in a convenient spot.  A man jumped the car for me and told me to get to a station as soon as possible and to not kill the engine.  Well, I made it to the first red light and the engine DIED.  A good semaritan stopped to help me push the car off the road.  I called a wrecker and had the car towed to another local dealer.  The dealer is replacing the Alternator today (a $280.0  repair).  I am glad that I have towing on my auto insurance.  At least I will be reimbursed for the towing.  I have been researching Malibu problems today and have noticed numerous Alternator problems.  It makes me wonder if I have had a problem with the Alternator all along (Hmmm).

By the way,  I paid about $18,000 for the car new and I was offered 12,000 by the dealer six months after I bought it because I was so unhappy with the reliability.  I was home ill one day while the car was in the shop and saw MY car on the dealers commercial for sale???  The car was not for sale.  I guess they didn't have any Malibu's in stock and needed one for a prop.  They had the car for over a week for repairs.  I was informed the delay was for parts.  Hmmm?  

I love the car...but, not the mechanical problems.  "The car you knew America could build".  In conclusion, the problems are likely due to bad design.  GM should compensate all Malibu owners for their trouble.

Best of luck!
