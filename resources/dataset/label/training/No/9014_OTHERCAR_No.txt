            My husband and I purchased our 2000 Kia Sportage brand new in June of 2000.  Since then we have had the work done on the following items:
The Actuator was replaced, the front Brake Pads and Rotors were replaced, then the Rotors were Machined because they warped a second time and it was not under warranty to replace them again.  The Air Compressor was replaced, the Mass Flow Sensor, Air Filter and Expansion Valve were also replaced.  The Power Steering belt has been replaced twice.  The second time it was only under warranty because the first replacement was under a one-year parts warranty.  The passenger side Airbag and the Glove Box were both adjusted because some how they had become loose and rattled like crazy.  The Tire Stopper on the back had to be adjusted because it became loose and sounded like the back door was going to fall off if you drove over a bump.  The Heat Shield fell onto the Muffler and rusted it through so the Muffler had to be replaced.  Not to mention that we still have on going transmission, brake and belt problems most of which will not be covered under our 3 year 36,000 mile warranty if any more work needs to be done.  Our Sportage is only a year and a half old and has 21,000 miles on it.  I am fighting Kia right now because we want our money back.  After I have read comments from other Kia owners with the same problems, I am more convinced that Kia makes shoddy cars and won't back them up.  It is time for more people to speak up and make some noise.  Mail your complaints to Margie Wirz-Head of Consumer Affairs with Kia Motors America in California.  Her address is: Kia Motors America, 9801 Muirlands Blvd., Irvine, CA 92618.  Also send a copy of your complaint to the Better Business Bureau at P.O. Box 970, Colton, CA 92324.  Unless you report to the BBB in the state where the Headquarters are, chances are your complaint will not get heard.  I do not intend to pay for any repairs on this piece of junk and neither should you.  Feel free to e-mail me at Mldrdn@cs.com.
