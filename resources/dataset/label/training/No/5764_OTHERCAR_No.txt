            JVC has always had a good reputation for quality, but maybe this is their first digital camera. I've owned the camera for only one month, but I have spent twice as much time reading the manual as using the camera.

The camera is much too complicated for the average user. To learn how to use all its functions would take me at least 6 months of full-time schooling. The design is simply OVERKILL. Far to complicated for the everyday user. 

Instruction manual is VERY poor. In some cases totally ambiguous and unfathomable. Also, the controls are poorly designed. The so-called 'Power Dial' (which is the main control) is cumbersome and poorly designed. The Power Dial, the Zoom control, the Mode control are are located so close together, that it's very difficult to avoid changing the Mode or switching the Power Dial to another function. 

Erasing photos from the Smart Media card is very cumbersome, and if you happen to let the card get full, it becomes virtually impossible. The film copy mode (for shooting negatives or slides) is very poorly explained in the manual, and even when you understand how to do it, the challenge is considerable and the results are poor.

Having two LCD panels (one on the back and one on the top of the camera) is a pain. Also, many functions are much too slow. Also, outdoor daylight, it's almost impossible to determine whether the picture has been taken or not. If there is a beep. I've never heard it yet. The flash is annoying, because it's on by default and you have to turn it off before taking each picture. A royal pain that is.

It's an attractive looking camera, but let's be realistic--function is beauty. In terms of function this camera is very ugly. If you ask about shutter lag--who knows?? You never when when the camera has taken the picture.
Also, photo quality is not nearly as good as my Canon PowerShot A20. which has only 2.1 Mega. This camera is best for professionals because the average person will go crazy trying to learn how to use it and putting up with its deficiencies.
