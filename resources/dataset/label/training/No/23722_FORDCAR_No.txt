              I personally do not own this vehicle, but my in-laws do.  After listening to all the complaints about this truck that my in-laws have, I felt compelled to write an Epinion about it.  My in laws do not reside in any one State, they are constantly travelling, so they accumulate <i>many</i> miles on their vehicles.  Keep in mind that this truck has not been in the shop only in Utah, but in several states, sometimes more than once in the same State.  The following review will be based on my father in laws opinions and experience with his <b>Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat</b>, written in question and answer form.

DnDn4kidz: &quot;Why did you purchase this particular truck, the<b>Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat</b>?

Father In Law(FIL from here on out): &quot;We bought the Ford because it was the only truck that met all the specifications we were looking for, including full size rear doors.  We've never had any trouble with any of the other Ford vehicles we've ever owned, and figured we would not have any problems with the  <b>Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat</b>.&quot;

DnDn4kidz: &quot;What do you like about this truck, and what do you not like?&quot;(this list will be long&lt;g&gt;)

FIL: &quot;We like everything about this truck, except the mechanical failures we have experienced.  We like the looks, the comfort, and every other aspect.  The mechanical failures we have experienced have considerably overwhelmed the details we like about this truck.&quot;

DnDn4kidz:&quot;What have been the problems with the<b>Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat</b>?&quot;

FIL:&quot;Where do you want to start?Hehe~Within the first 1000 miles we drove this truck, the transmission and the after-cooler on the turbo failed.  Within the first 15,000 miles the steering box and the brakes failed, losing complete control of the truck.  The torque converter in the transmission broke within 20,000 miles.  The transmission failed and the torque converter failed again, a second time after <i>Ford</i> 'fixed' them.  Several times we have lost all the gauges, which are electronic, to include fuel gauge, speedometer, tachometer, overdrive on transmission fails, etc.  If you lose the power steering fluid, like when the steering box broke, you can no longer steer, <i>nor</i> stop the truck, because the fluid is all in one column.  We continue to experience these same problems over and over.&quot;

DnDn4kidz:&quot;What does the dealership do about these problems?&quot;

FIL:&quot;The dealership(in Utah where the truck was purchased) continues to fix the problems within a timely manner, but the problems continue to occur.  But, for $43,000 you would expect to be purchasing a vehicle that did not <i>need</i> to be in the shop every other week(or so it seems).&quot;

DnDn4kidz:&quot;Why don't you turn it back in as a 'lemon'?&quot;

FIL:&quot;The *law* in Utah states that a vehicle can not be considered a lemon until the same problem has occurred at least four times within 12 months, or unless it has numerous safety failures.  The next time one of these problems occur with our truck,  we will be able to turn it in as a lemon.  If we have one more major problem with this truck, we're turning it in and buying a Chevy.&quot;

DnDn4kidz:&quot;Aside from all the mechanical failures, how comfortable is this truck to ride in?&quot;

FIL:&quot;Well, it would be a lot more comfortable if we weren't constantly worrying about something breaking!  The front and back seats are all extremely comfortable.  There is plenty of leg room for short or tall passengers, and plenty of head room.&quot;

DnDn4kidz:&quot;Aside from the constant worry of something breaking, how is driving this truck?  Could someone such as myself, who has never driven a big truck(only my bus/van&lt;g&gt;) drive this truck?&quot;(My FIL is <i>not</i> much taller than myself, so if he can drive it, I'm sure I could..hehe...)

FIL:&quot;Oh, it's easy to drive.  When everything is functioning properly, it's an excellent vehicle to drive.  It takes a barnyard to turn it around in, because it's a huge truck, but you have to expect needing a lot of area to turn such a large vehicle in.&quot;

DnDn4kidz:&quot;How does it tow?&quot;(My in laws own/tow a trailer.)

FIL:&quot;It tows it's maximum allowed towing rate with no problems or lug on the engine. With the size, towing capacity, and deisel engine it can tow about anything you would want to tow.&quot;

DnDn4kidz:&quot;Would you recommend the <b>Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat</b> to anyone, if so, who?&quot;

FIL:&quot;I would recommend this particular truck to my brother in law..hehe..but nobody I actually like.  I would recommend another Ford truck similar to this one, but not this particular one.  We would even purchase another <b>Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat</b> and try our luck with it, but we think <i>this one</i> that we got is a lemon, and someone on the manufacturing line had to have been on drugs.  We know several people who own <b>Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat</b>, who have not had any problems with thier truck, we just got *lucky*.&quot;

Personally, I do not know what any of the following 'specs' mean, but based on the above 'interview' with my father in law, it sounds like over all this would be a good truck, that he would highly recommend, but just not the one they got stuck with.  The 'recommend to potential buyers' is a yes <i>and</i> no response.  He would recommend this truck, but beware, you may get stuck with a 'lemon' also.
