            We purchased a pontiac sunfire last year because of the looks.  It's a sporty little car, but unfortunately has no pick-up.  You would think by looking at it that it would be fast as all get out, but it's not.  It's been in the shop once while it was under warranty to replace the fuel regulator.  We've had to rotate the brake drums 3 times already because they wear fast.  Gas mileage for such a small car is not good.  We get about 25 miles per gallon on the road, about 21 in town.  Sportiness and looks are it's best features.  A spoiler is a must with this vehicle.  A popular car, but wouldn't buy another one.<br><br>
