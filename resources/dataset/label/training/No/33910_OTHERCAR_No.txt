             I bought this car because I was sick of my sedan and wanted something a bit more sporty. This car has been a dream on handling. The clutch will give you problems if you are not used to driving a manual transmission. Clutch is stiff and goes back far. Feels like a sport's car clutch. I have the S model, which is not as fast as the V-TEC or the SI, but I have definately not had any problems with acceleration  at all. The design is sleek from the inside out. Digital dash makes for a nice change from the ordinary, however this does have drawbacks. Messing around with a blown circuit or shelling out cash for some sort of computer chip just so your fuel gauge will work is no fun. The cabin noise is a bit loud on the inside when driving on the freeway, but the fun of driving this car makes up for it. Airbags make for a more confident drive and sunroof is a big plus. Sits low to the ground, so it is a bit of a task getting in and out. If you're not fairly small, be aware of having to lift yourself out of your bucket seat.
