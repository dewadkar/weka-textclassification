            Okay...I got sucked into all the hype.  And the PT Cruiser is a good looking car, minivan, suv...whatever.  So I ordered one.  One day I happened to drive into the local dealership (Fresno Chrysler) and my salesperson told me he had just gotten one in and it was EXACTLY what I wanted.  I test drove it and it was okay.  Frankly, the fact that it is based on a Neon became clear when I drove it.  It feels like a 15-20,000 car.  As I was the first person to arrive it was going to be my honor to purchase that red, limited edition PT Cruiser. WOW...what luck.  There was only one, little tiny problem.  My $22,000 (according to Chrysler Corp. literature) Neon based, 4 cylinder car, truck, whatever was now going to cost $30,000.  That's right, thirty grand.  My salesperson admitted that it was a huge markup, and that the dealership was going to make a bundle.  But, If I didn't want it right then-and-there that it would be his pleasure to sell it to one of the two other suckers who he had called &quot;just in case.&quot;  Hey, I love capitalism, but it is interesting that the corporate website still says these little, Neon based cute-mobiles are 16-22 grand.  

If you can't stop thinking about how cool you'll be if you can just get one...if you think that the your chick magnet will suddenly become hundreds of times more powerful if only you can just be seen in a PT Cruiser...  if you think that you will be happier and more attractive in Chrysler's newest style enhancer then go ahead - pay 30 THOUSAND dollars for one of these Neons on steroids.  Me, I'm gonna put in an extra 5 grand and get me a BMW three series.  We'll see who gets the chicks!   <br><br>
