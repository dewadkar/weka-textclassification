            The Polaroid PDC-640 is an okay camera for someone who simply want a digital camera to play around with.  It is fairly easy to use, inexpensive, and fun to use with friends.  The images are viewable instantaneously on the camera which always makes for a good quick laugh.  The biggest problem with the camera is that the pictures usually look best on the 1.8" LCD.  Once transferred to the computer (which can be a pain unless you buy a separate flashpath floppy disk adapter) the images don't seem as nice.  With the camera set to the highest resolution (640x480) you only get about 12 pictures on the memory card and they are still fairly fuzzy.  The battery life is also very poor.  It takes 4 AA batteries that will most likely be drained before the night is over.

If inexpensive and "okay" image quality is what you are looking for, then this is a great camera.  But if you are trying to take higher quality (ie: photo quality) pictures then this is not the camera for you.
