            Call me a dissenter, call me a sore thumb, but I've never associated quality and reliability with Japanese cars.  Fuel economy and low price? Yes;  Reliability? Maybe;  But quality? Never.  Perhaps every single one that I've driven or been driven in have been the defective sour grapes of Honda, Toyota, and Nissan, but that has been my experience.  Here's one story to illustrate that fact.  One summer, I was endowed with a 1996 Toyota Tercel 2-Door that was as stripped down as you can get except for the automatic transmission option.  Quality, safety, and performance are last things that comes to mind.  (I was without a car that summer because the owner of this Tercel was connected with &quot;borrowing&quot; my beloved '84 Buick Regal and crashing it.  My poor baby!)

Mind you, this <b>is</b> Toyota's bottom-of-the-line model in the U.S. and they phased it out after 1998, probably to replace it with their subcompact hybrid vehicles like the Echo.  The Corolla is a much better choice of car if you're in the market for a low-end fuel efficient Japanese car: I'd recommend staying away from the Tercel at all costs.  Here's why:

First, the car looks and feels cheap on the inside and outside.  In typical conservative and bland Japanese econobox styling, the side panels and the rear are slabs of metal with no curves or tasteful bulges anywhere in sight.  The 13&quot; wheels and 155/80R13 tires are tiny, but typical for a car of this size and purpose.  There is cheap, hard plastic everywhere on the inside and the seats are one of the most uncomfortable, stiff excuses for support that I've seen in a long time.  There is no reassuring &quot;thud&quot; when the doors are closed and even a small guy like me (5' 5&quot;) felt a bit cramped inside the car.  The 3-speed automatic transmission is so inadequate and probably robs you of about half of the engine's power (which isn't much: the 1.5L 4-cylinder produces 93 hp @ 5400 rpm).  Definitely get it in manual if you were to get this car, otherwise you'll have to hang on to dear life while on the freeway or passing.  To its credit, I will say that visibility was great and the rear windows were large enough for spotting blind spots during lane changes which seems to be a rarity in coupes/2-Doors.  I sit very high in this car, perhaps too high that I feel like the car is probably going to tip over if I go through a turn too fast.  The trunk is average for this class and there is no fold-down rear seats so what you see is what you get in terms of trunk space.

If you've never driven a stripped-down economy car (like me), then you will begin to notice all the little &quot;features&quot; that you always took for granted.  Examples?  How about adjustable steering wheel column, or remotely controlled side mirrors (I'm not even asking for power mirrors, just a cable!), or air-conditioner, or power steering?  Yes, power steering!  My old Buick had the infamous American car &quot;over-boosted&quot; power steering and I was so used to driving with a few fingers on the wheel.  Imagine my shock when I had to use <b>both</b> hands (to be clear, that's 10 fingers and 2 palms) <b>and</b> my arms and maybe even part of my upper body muscles to turn the steering wheel!  I didn't realize that cars came without power steering nowadays-- it's the 90s, are we making any progress or what??!!  I definitely got more workout driving this car than I would at the gym.  Parallel parking or any other maneuvers that requires turning the wheel over a short distance was a nightmare that I tried to avoid at all times.

The car rattles a lot, even while going 35mph.  Toyota=Quality?  Says who?  There is so much road and wind noise that driving on the highway gets tiring and scary very very fast.  Call me crazy, but I took this car on a 6-hour (one way) road trip to upstate New York and back so I know about wind and road noise!  In fact, even a light gust of wind will make this car sway on the highway which had me clutching tightly at the steering wheel with fear in my eyes at all times.  I had to take many breaks along the way because the seats were so uncomfortable and the noise levels unbearable.  I usually only take one break while I drive up to Ithaca.  As if all the noises and rattling wasn't enough, I got my first and only speeding ticket while coming down from Ithaca in this car.  &quot;But you can't possibly go fast in this car!&quot; you say?  Well, there is a little thing called brakes that don't work too well in this car.  I was doing about 60mph the whole time, but just then I was coming down this long hill and the car picked up momentum and started to go faster;  I was trying to keep it straight (wind was knocking it left and right) while trying to brake which rattled the car like a washing machine, so I was pumping it and taking it easy.  But I guess it was too late because the state trooper saw me before I got the speed down to legal levels...

I don't like most 4-cylinders, let's make that clear.  I need 6 or more, otherwise you can't please me (with few exceptions: Integra GS-R, Civic Si, Prelude SH).  Acceleration (with the automatic transmission) makes the engine beg for mercy and does not instill any confidence in the driver because it takes too long for downshifting and to kick in.  It is so loud under hard acceleration (such as merging back into 60mph highway after a rest stop) that you wonder if you are going to blow up the engine.  The ride is fairly harsh, but not in a good sports car kind of way.  Handling is poor and I wouldn't dare turn corners above 15mph in this car.  I know it's not built for performance, but there <b>are</b> other economy cars that don't make you feel so unsafe and underpowered like this Tercel.

If there's one thing to love about this car, it's the fuel economy.  Toyota touts 31/35 mpg for the 3-speed automatic and up to 33/39 mpg for the 4-speed manual.  Compared to my 4.1L V6 Buick Regal (that's almost 3 times as much engine displacement, ha!), this car presented a novelty concept for me: driving around for weeks without refueling.  Another positive aspect about this car is its reliability, true to the Japanese car mantra.  It has not gone any major repairs that I know of to this day, so if you find a used '96 Tercel, it is probably mechanically reliable, although some of the interior may be falling apart and you still have all the quality issues I mentioned above.

It's probably unfair to judge Toyota based on this low-end model alone, but it's just one of many experiences I have with Japanese cars (yes, that includes mid to high-end models) that are such low quality it makes me think twice about having them on my car shopping list.  But if you find Toyota on your used car shopping list, I suggest skipping the Tercel and go with the next higher-up model, the Corolla.  Hell, I might even be so bold as to suggest a new Daewoo, Hyundai, or Kia at this price range ($6,800 - $11,000 for 1996 Tercel)!
