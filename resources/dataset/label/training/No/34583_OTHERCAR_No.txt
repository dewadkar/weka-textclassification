            In 1997, I bought a '93 SC1 with 61,000 miles and automatic trans.  I
bought the car because I wanted something fuel-efficient, and it deeply
disappointed me in this regard.  With the automatic, it was rated 26/33
but with 70% highway driving, the best it could muster was 21 mpg.

A couple of visits to the Saturn dealership confirmed there was nothing
wrong mechanically.  These visits, however, further disappointed me.
Prices were high, and both the sales &amp; service personnel absolutely
refused to hear any negative comments.  With a smile and polite style,
I was repeatedly told rehearsed lines from what is a good marketing dept.

On the positive side, the seats were comfortable (though someone like me
who is 5-11 or taller will wish the sliders went back a little more),
the handling was surprisingly good given the skinny tires, and though not
blazingly quick, the motor seemed to like being revved up.

The automatic transmission started having trouble, and after taking care
of that, I sold the car (after 8 months of owning it).  That process was
equally disappointing.  No one wanted this car!  The Saturn dealerships
all advertised that they wanted used Saturn's and that they would pay top
dollar, but when I tried to take them up on their claims, I was offered
ridiculously low deals.

I hope that Saturn has learned from experiences like this, because all
the spin doctoring in the world won't beat word of mouth.
