            I have owned my new Chevy Astro since June 2000, and overall have been rather satisfied with its performance. However, the other day I found out something that I want to never repeat! While turning into a parking lot from a busy intersection my Chevy Astro stalled. I lost the ability to steer and the breaks were so hard to engage I had to put every ounce of strength into the breaks to stop the vehicle. Luckily I was only going about 35 and would have only went over a curb and into a tree if I had not gotten it to stop. I restarted the vehicle and was able to steer and break again. It just chills me to think if this had happened when I was going much faster with my two kids in the van! Needless to say I will be taking it in to be checked by professionals! It is scary to think you can loose almost complete control over your vehicle because it stalls!<br><br>
