            I am the proud--or at least most of the time--owner of a 1995 Jeep Wrangler with the Rio Grande package.  I have enjoyed it through my days in high school.  It has been an excellent car for me, but is it right for you.  First off, a major part of buying a Jeep Wrangler is the image which comes with the vehicle.  This is an image of youth, excitement, and basically &quot;I don't want a economic car.&quot;  This is a great vehicle for young people such as me but also for older people who want to redefine their image.  Also great about the Wrangler are riding through the country with the top off.  If you like to have the wind rushing through your hair and do not mind the laborous task of taking off the top, then a strongly recommend buying a Jeep Wrangler with a soft top.  The Jeep is also excellent for off-road purposes but it is equally qualified on-road.  I just recently drove my Jeep to Panama City Beach--almost 600 miles away and it performed fine.  I strongly recommend a Jeep Wrangler to anybody regardless of sex or age, but the final decision is up to you.<br><br>
