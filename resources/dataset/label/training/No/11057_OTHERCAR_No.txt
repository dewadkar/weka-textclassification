            I have a 95 Mercury Mystique.I've had it only 3 years and interior is falling apart! My cup holders have snapped. My air conditioning vents have fallen off. My ashtray was automatic, so If your a smoker do not buy this model. you cannot dump your ashtray and the vacuum doesn't fit in the small opening . My ashtray is stuck in the closed position and will not open. The carpet is pulling away from the door on passenger side.I'm not hard on cars, okay maybe I am  where driving is concerned but not on the inside. I wanted to keep this car because my dad got it for me with his savings.driving performance was really good until recently,transmission is bad. Overall, I'm very disappointed in how my car looks now and how it is performing due to transmission slipping.The Mystique would be an excellent lease or travel car but it can't hold up to the wear and tear of everyday use.<br><br>
