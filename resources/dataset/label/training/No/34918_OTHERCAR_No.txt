            Interesting review on the Odyssey Safety Hazard - catching fire due to static electricity.  I have experienced extreme static electricity.  Enough that I hate getting out of the van and closing the door.  I try not to touch with bare hands and create quite a spectacle when I do, as I get shocked so bad.  Not to mention what it does to my hair.  It is extremely annoying.  I have thought this too could be a safety hazard (like fire).  I have had my van for 6 months and I do not like it.  Yes it is easy to configure, but the seats are so uncomfortable. 

The sliding door sticks at the most inopportune times, when I am dropping my daughter off at school and have a line of angry parents and school bus drivers behind me.  The next big complaint is that the transmission will not go into any gear lower than D4.  There are no interior lights under the dash or by the control panel so it is pitch dark below the steering wheel without lighting a dome light.  I am trying to figure out how to rid myself of this van without losing over $5,000.  Any ideas.  I feel like there is no way out.  <br><br>
