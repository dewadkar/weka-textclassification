            I am a huge Nikon 35mm fan.  I have owned an N70, F100, and currently own an F5. So when I decided to go digital, I went to straight to Nikon.  I wanted something simple, primarily a camera to capture images for sending emails or photographing items to advertise on Ebay, etc.  I didn�t want to cross the self-imposed $400 to $450 barrier so I considered the Nikon Coolpix 775.  

When I got it out of the box, I was surprised by its stubby size.  It�s small, but not quite compact enough to stuff in a shirt or pants pocket.  It was also very light weight (almost too light) at about 7 ounces with the battery in it.  It seems the whole camera body was molded from plastic, which kind of gave it a toy-like feel.  

Nevertheless, I looked past its questionable feel and focused (no pun intended) on its features.  The 2.01 million effective pixels delivered surprisingly detailed color saturated photos in the 1600 x 1200 mode (its highest resolution).  It has a wide 3x zoom that is equivalent to 38-115 in a 35mm format.  It also has a �Best Shot� selector which fires a number of shots of an object then it selects the photo with the clearest details to store. 

Another nice feature was the 256-element Matrix Metering system that was dead-on most of the time.  The exposure control (+/-2 EV in 1/3 EV steps) allowed me to get just the right amount of brightness when I wanted to be more creative.  The flash also worked well and didn�t produce any noticeable flare.  I often shot in Automatic mode, but the camera also has 7 other modes: Party, Backlight, Portrait, Night Portrait, Landscape, Beach/Snow, and Sunset.

Then there is the focusing system.  It honestly was a disappointment.  Even though it has Single and Continuous focus modes like Nikon�s SLRs, focusing was slow and images were a bit softer than I expected, even when mounted on a tri-pod. (yes, I did fiddle with the sharpness modes)  My biggest gripes were the lack of a manual focus and spot focus modes. With its contrast detecting through the lens system, focusing on objects without a lot of detail was particularly tricky, especially if there was more contrast on objects in the immediate background.  There was also no user control over shutter speed or aperture for depth of field control.

Another disappointment was that the low and slow ISO 100 sensitivity.  As a result, the flash often fired on indoor shots even though it has a fast f2.8 lens in wide angle.  

On the plus side though, the camera menus were intuitive and pretty quick to learn.  And downloading the images from the camera to the computer was a snap.  Pressing one button on the camera or clicking once on the computer screen icon downloaded the images through a USB cable.  For some reason though my Win98 computer would often freeze and subsequently crash when I unplugged the USB from the camera.  I never could figure out how to resolve that problem.  

Another big plus, a rechargeable Li-Ion battery and charger (a $100 value) was included in the package. The proprietary rechargeable Li-Ion battery lasts about an hour-and-a-half and takes a few hours to recharge.  Expensive 2CR5/DL245 lithium batteries can be purchased as backups. If spending the afternoon out, I found the rechargeable battery was short lived.  For that reason, I would honestly prefer AA NiMH battery system. (AA's also drive F100's and F5's)  They are not only cheaper, but if they died, cheap alkaline AA�s can be found everywhere would be great backups until a wall socket could be found.   

All in all, the Nikon 775 is a very compact point and shoot digital camera that is capable of producing very good photos.  I know I risk being flamed by Nikon fans, but I cannot recommend this camera, especially not to experienced photographers.  Although I really love Nikon's engineering, at a street price of $450, I felt the 775 lacked several really important and basic user controls that are found elsewhere in its class, mainly spot focusing, and faster ISO sensitivity (not to mention shutter speed and aperture controls).  

I ended up trading this camera and for a $400 Olympus C-2040 which has an even faster f1.8 lens and slew of SLR style controls including Slow Sync!  I highly recommend you check out the Olympus digicams.  For the money, they are very tough to beat.

Have fun with it. 


10/18/01 The price has dropped since I wrote this article.  The average price is around $399.  Note that Nikon's competitors have done the same with their own lines as well.
