            Some cars simply are not content to fit in with the norms of Detroit auto styling.  Some of these design gambles, like Chrysler's PT Cruiser, have experienced enormous success while others, like Pontiac's befuddled Aztek, have done nothing but elicit negative response.  So where does the 1992 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme fit, with its unique styling (which seems to have been born in the 80s, destined for the 90s, and set for the scrap yard in the 00s)?  

The Cutlass Supreme has something of a love it/hate it appearance that leaves no room for ambivalent feelings.  If you happen to like its body design then you also most certainly find its grandma-type cloth interior and dash appearance to be perfectly suitable for your needs.  Moreover, if the interior of the Supreme pleases you then you also must enjoy the car's power, handling, and reliability.  The point is that every aspect of the Supreme's design lends itself to another part leading people to either an overly positive response or a full-blown hatred.  

Appearance aside, the most important aspect of a car is its driving feeling and ride.  The Cutlass Supreme feels a bit awkward at first but you soon adjust to its quirky front end and curving rear window.  The Supreme is front-wheel drive and therefore provides excellent winter traction... but limits the car's handling.  The turning ratio is rather wide and is not as crisp or responsive as one would like.  Nevertheless, the Olds makes up for what it lacks in control with an adequate 160 horsepower V6 powerplant.  The engine makes up for its occasional roughness with overall reliability and low maintenance responsibility.  

To drive the 1992 Cutlass Supreme you must enjoy its styling, since it essentially encompasses everything this car has to offer-- quirky design details combined with overall dependability and functionality.
