            Oh, the excitement!  We were going to trade in our 10 year old Volvo and buy a brand new Plymouth Voyager.  After the requisite 7 hours of haggling with salespeople, we finally left in our new car!  Our excitement was short-lived. 

A few months later, we took out the removable center seat to transport a large object, and the seat would not go back in.  Six months after purchase, the driver's side seatbelt broke and it took over a month to get the replacement part.  However, these were only minor problems compared to what was to come.

After we had the vehicle for 9 months, it stalled constantly and died, usually taking several tries to restart it. Unfortunately, this particular problem repeats itself about every 2 years.  It's apparently caused by a part called the AIS motor - we're on our third one of those.  

The car was less than two years old when the transmission went out completely. Of course we were on vacation about 100 miles from home - it was quite an ordeal driving home in a car that wouldn't go above 20 miles per hour!  The car is currently on it's third transmission. 

Three years into ownership of this lemon, one day before leaving on a trip to Phoenix, AZ, the air conditioner broke.  It now works sporadically - at best, only 50% of the time.  It's apparently one of those things that has to be malfunctioning when you bring it to the dealer or they can't diagnose the problem, short of suggesting you replace the entire air conditioner for $800.  No thanks.

The topper was bringing the car in because of a loud noise and heavy smoke coming from the exhaust pipe.  The bad news?  It needed a new engine.  Fortunately we had 500 miles left on our warranty, so it was covered.  In all fairness, much of what had to be done was covered under warranty, but who expects to be bringing a new car back to the dealership for repair every 3 to 4 months?  

The brakes constantly need replacing, we've replaced the water pump twice, the driver's side window broke, the battery exploded - everything you could possibly imagine going wrong with a car has happened, and then some! This has been the most unreliable car I have ever owned.  I have a stack of paperwork from the dealership so thick that it no longer fits in the case designed to hold it!  

I would never buy another Plymouth Voyager, and would steer anyone else away from doing it too.  The only good thing I have to say about this car is that it is a very nice shade of blue!<br><br>
