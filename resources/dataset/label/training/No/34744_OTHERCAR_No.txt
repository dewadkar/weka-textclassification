            I bought my '97 Passat new, feeling like I was back in a family friend. My father had had 4 VWs when I was a child, and had put over 300,000 miles on his 1977 Rabbit. At first I really liked my Passat, except lots of little things kept breaking off or going wrong - for example I shut the door with a window down and the regulator broke, at $348 to repair, and then the replacement broke 3 weeks later. At least the dealer honored the 1 year warranty on parts and labor. The cupholders are fragile and broke a couple of times as well, stuff like that.

At 34,000 miles the air conditioning went out, and I was quoted $2400 for repair - $1650 for parts and $750 for labor, since the whole dashboard would have to come out. Needless to say, it remained unrepaired. Around the same time it developed a severe drinking problem, burning oil like crazy. The dealer tried to tell me that burning up to one quart of oil per 1000 miles was normal, but could never explain why it had not done that for the first 4 years I had owned it. 

The oil problem got worse and worse and finally the dealer had to fix it (something to do with a compression problem on cylinder 6) under the original owner 100,000 mile/10 year warranty. Interesting that they no longer offer that on the new models... Engine check lights would go on and they would charge me $400 - $700 each time for some obscure valve, and then the light would go on again, always with a different problem. The dealer is very expensive to use but very few other places work on VWs - there are BMW and Mercedes and Porsche mechanics all over, but not a lot of VW shops. Parts are not cheap, either. And tires...! be aware that they use a high performance tire not often kept in stock that only lasts about 30,000 miles and costs $199 each to replace ($149 if you can find a sale).

About 1 month ago (at 56,950 miles, with almost exactly 6 years of service and extremely loving and diligent care) the car threw a rod. The engine was of course, completely destroyed. The dealer again had to fix it under the warranty, but by now I had had enough. As soon as I got it back I traded it for a new Honda. I am bitterly disappointed but will never buy a VW again.
