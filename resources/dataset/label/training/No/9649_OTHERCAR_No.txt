              I am the type of person who buys a used car for a thousand dollars and
would accept the fact that I will have to get my hands dirty repairing it.
If I were lucky it would last approximately two years.
  We recently had an addition to our family and my wife said that she has had enough of the uncertainty, so we go out looking for a fairly new used car. &quot;Something more reliable&quot; she said, so we looked around and found a 1997 Dodge Neon at a G.M. dealership. 
  The car rides very well under 50 mph.,but it only has three gears which
makes highway driving less fuel efficient[made for city streets].
  We have had this car for six months and have had the head gasket replaced twice, steering knuckle replaced, and the gears in the transmission had to be re-aligned.
  Gas mileage is lower than would be expected in a compact car.
  I would not recommend this car to anyone unless they lived in a city and bought the extended warrantees.
