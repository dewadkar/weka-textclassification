            I was very excited to buy the &quot;new look&quot; BMW 323i as it had been so well-received by the press.  I bought the car a year ago, in December, 1998. Although there are some positives to the car (e.g., comfort, styling, pretty good handling), my new car kept drifting left (i.e., it wasn't properly aligned) and it took multiple trips to my dealership to get that properly fixed.  Also, the car vibrates more than the prior BMW 3-series cars.  (These vibrations can be felt in the clutch, while holding the steering wheel, or while holding the gearshift knob when the car is at about 2900 rpm or higher.)  Additionally, my right front window squeaks a bit (which I still need to get properly fixed).  And the transmission has flaws.  For instance, it takes a very long time for the transmission fluid to warm up -- often 20+ minutes (especially if temperature is less than about 40F) -- so gear-shifting does not happen smoothly for short winter trips.  Another disappointment: when my car had about 2,000 miles on it, a friend of mine tried my car and drove up a steep hill -- the clutch slipped and within a matter of seconds, my clutch was fried to a crisp, costing my about $800 to replace -- none of which was not covered under the warranty.  I wrote a letter to BMW arguing that a properly working clutch should not be able to be severely damaged in just a few seconds, but the letter BMW wrote back reveals it did not understand my point.  Additionally, gear-shifting between 3rd and 4th gears (up or down) is not as smooth as shifting between other gears.  Most bizarre, the dealer closest to me refuses to service my car in a timely manner.  I wrote to BMW about that too.  Oddly, BMW replied that it has little/no influence on its dealers -- in other words, it was okay for the dealer to discriminate against me and treat my emergency problems 3 weeks after the fact just because I bought my car at a different dealership!  (Yet when I bought the car, I asked whether I could get the car serviced anywhere and I was shown a long list of dealerships that would be happy to service my car.  Also, BMW suggests the car has 170 horsepower, but I know that my parents' 1992 Chevy Cavalier (6 cylinder, 130 or so horsepower) accelerates much more quickly.  The BMW seems a bit sluggish at low speeds (given its 170 horses).  I suspect this has to do with the torque curve and the gear ratio.  Finally, my front and rear windows fog up a lot (on the inside) making night driving a bit less safe.  Overall, I'm unimpressed with the &quot;new&quot; BMW 3-series.<br><br>
