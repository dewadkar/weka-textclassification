            I bought a DX-10 last year.... First problem I had....There was 'supposed' to be an included coupon for a free 'floppy drive interface card'... The 'interface card' was one of the prime motivations for selecting the Fuji....  No card! and neither the retailer (Xoom.com) nor Fuji were willing to rectify the problem...
Secondly, although the camera does take excellent pictures, I never could take more than 3 or 4 of them before the battery's were COMPLETELY drained- and I mean DRAINED!.....  I would put in 4 new battery's...take 3 or 4 pictures and the camera would be dead.... Since I didn't have the optional AC adaptor...it would also take 4 battery's to upload the pictures to my computer..and yes again the New battery's were completely drained!   I have been told by owners of DIFFERENT brand digital cameras that they don't have this problem, that they can expect 50-100 pictures from a set of battery's....  FUJI still hasn't responded to my questions regarding the performance of their %%$#%^ camera so I don't know if 'I' have a lemon or all Fuji's work this way..in any case I would recommend a Kodak, since everyone I know that has one, gets better pictures and MORE of them!<br><br>
