            <b> Battery Life is TOO short </b>
The only problem I have is the battery life Buy a large 64 MB memory stick. 

<b> What about the Flash? </b>
The indoor pictures have been super (have taken shots when the LCD screen on the back was totally dark because of lighting conditions.....but the photo turned out fine!!!!). However It's flash really is sub-standard. You can compensate with adjustments but that does defeat the purpose of a built-in flash.

<b> Software </b>
Software could be a little easier to use but I have not had any real problems so far.

<b> Perks and Bennys </b>
TV presentation of this camera is superb for many uses. Try it!

<b> What about Windows ME? </b>
The USB driver for Windows ME is available at:
http://www.sel.sony.com/SEL/service/usbme.shtml 

<b> No controls </b>
Unable to control: shutter speed, focus, exposition.

<b> Compact Design </b>
If you don't want to look like the 'American Tourist' this is small enough to fit in your pocket and bring to you 35MM quality.
