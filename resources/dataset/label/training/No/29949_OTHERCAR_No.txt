            I bought a 1992 Dodge Caravan from a dealer. Being a loyal Chrysler buyer since 1979, I did not research the product but rather trusted Chrysler to be dependable. When I bought the vehicle it was used, and I expected some repair and maintenance. After about 6 months my transmission started acting up and would not shift properly. Since I purchased an extra warranty, I was forced to take it to one of America's largest and most well known transmission repair facilities. They recommended a full rebuild only $1600.00. When I asked why, they told me they average 3 to 6 Chrysler mini vans a week for transmission break down, and that they are ONE of the worst on the market since 1988, and they still use the same transmissions on the new Mini vans today. After rebuilding it, I picked it up and had the same problem, within 1 block. Took it back and ended up in shop for over 1 month taking it out 5 times, rebuilding it 3 times and replacing it with another factory rebuilt before discovering, that it was getting contaminated by the cooler set up in the radiator. They refused to sell me a lifetime warranty, stating that these transmissions are so bad, they would lose money on it. Now after 1 yr. my reverse is out. JUST HOW DOES CHRYSLER GET AWAY WITH IT.  CHECK IT OUT BEFORE YOU BUY!! There is much more but no more room to write..<br><br>
