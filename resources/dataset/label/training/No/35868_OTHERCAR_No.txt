            My wife and I needed a four door family car after having our first baby in 1997.  After some research and speaking to owners of these cars, the Chevy Lumina was something that we thought we would take a closer look at.  After scanning the newspapers, we found a 1990 model for sale and called the seller to arrange a meeting.

It was the base model, which we preferred because the Euro models have a wing on the trunk lid that makes the car look strange.  Sort of like a four door &quot;mommy&quot; car that is trying to look sporty, but I will digress.  It had the 3.1L V6 engine and three-speed automatic.  The interior was still in great shape and the body had no rust, thanks to the sunny California weather.  Taking it for a test drive, the car rode smoothly enough and the large amount of glass allowed a good view of the road and surroundings with no blind spots.  The transmission shifts quietly without being jerky and the engine is very quiet with enough power to accelerate well.  The 3.1L engine in 1990 made 160 horsepower, which is ample enough for everyday driving.  We bought the car that night.

After owning it one year, I must say that I feel ambivalent about it.  It has been mostly reliable, with a few maladies which is to be expected from a car that is now ten years old.  

For instance, the water pump decided to puke coolant all over my father-in-law's driveway on Christmas morning.  There was a real bad oil leak, which was the fault of a seal on the top of the engine.  The mechanic told us that this problem is common on Chevy's 3.1L engine.  The alternator went dead as my family and I were coming home from dinner one night.  Luckily, we were only 10 minutes from home at the time.  The wheels were mysteriously bent one day and they were replaced with 16&quot; aluminum alloys from a newer Monte Carlo.  Handling and ride really improved with these new wheels, as the original ones were a little undersized for a car of this stature.

After one frightening afternoon, however, we decided to sell the car.  My wife was driving home from work and a peculiar smelling odor was emanating from the vents (the air conditioning was on).  It soon became so bad that she had to pull over because her eyes were watering and she was having a hard time breathing.  After towing it to our mechanic, he reported that some wires behind the dash had inexplicably melted and that was the odor that she smelled.  We drove the car for one more week and traded it in.

Overall, I would say the Lumina is a decent car if you're looking for something that is cheap, with lots of room and comfort.  The size is good for a family car.  It will fit 5 adults comfortably and 6 will fit tightly with the front bench seat.  The gas mileage was average; we got an average of 21 miles per gallon in the time that we owned it.  However, because of the unusual amount of things wrong with it within the first year of ownership, I would not buy another one.<br><br>
