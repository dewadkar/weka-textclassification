            I recently had occasion to rent a 2001 Kia Sportage while on an extended business trip. This car had 3800 miles on it when I received it, so it was virtually brand new. 
My first impression was very favorable. It looks like a very nice compact SUV. That impression lasted for about two minutes, until I tried to get my luggage in the back. There is no remote release for the liftgate, so you must manually pull a lever to swing open the spare tire, then use the key to unlock the door and pull up while keeping the key turned. Already I wasn't a happy camper. Then, I was unable to get the liftgate closed so that the "open liftgate" light would extinguish. I opened and shut it several times, trying to get it securely fastened. Actually, the liftgate rattled a bit, so that the light would periodically go out, then re-alluminate when I drove over a bumpy patch. 
This is a very compact SUV, I would say that the only passengers who are going to be happy in the back seat are small children. Even in the front seat you are shoulder to shoulder with a front seat passenger. Not necessarily a bad thing if that's what you want. 
I did expect the compactness of the car to translate into good gas mileage, but surprisingly, the gas mileage wasn't that great either. I did a lot of driving while in southern CA, and I had to put gas in almost every day. Another negative aspect was that the car felt like it was blowing all over the road in windy weather. The first night I had it, I had to drive over a fairly mountainous stretch of road (the Grapevine, for those of you familiar with southern CA). I was definitely a white knuckle driver for a bit!
Otherwise, for normal driving, this car is extremely responsive and easy to drive. The small wheelbase means that you can make tight turns with ease and fit into compact parking spaces. Parallel parking is a breeze.
Since this was a rental, I can't say much about long term reliability, but I did make some observations that are not flattering. The third day I had the car, it developed an annoying squeaky rattle from somewhere in the front end. The steering wheel gradually drifted off alignment until the normal "10 and 2" positions were really at 8 and 12. The low fuel indicator light came on when there was still 1/4 tank full. I really feared that it might tip over while making turns, even when I wasn't driving that fast. The narrow high body seems dangerous.
I didn't have occasion to use the 4 wheel drive capability, so I can't comment on that aspect. 
Overall, I would say this car can be fun to drive around town, but the minuses definitely outweigh any plusses. It is definitely off my list of future cars to consider.
