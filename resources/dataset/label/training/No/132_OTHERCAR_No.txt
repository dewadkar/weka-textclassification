            I bought this product in December of 1999.  It was my first purchase of a digital camera, and I bought it more as a novelty, than as a serious camera.  I own a Pentax point and shoot camera which is very weather resistant.  My Pentax is my preferred camera when camping or backpacking.  Since the Fuji is fairly small, I wanted to experiment with it to see if it could replace the Pentax on trips where weight is a consideration.

Frankly, in terms of image quality, the Pentax wins hands down.  Here are some general thoughts about the MX-1200.

1. Image quality is very average.  Compared to my Pentax, images are really disappointing.  Compared to sample images posted by other MX-1200 owners, my pictures seem fuzzier/more grainy.  Also, the lens on my camera probably has a defect, since the upper right corner of my pictures are all uniformly blurry.

2. The flash is really inadequate.  This is true of most other point and shoot digital cameras.

3. No carrying case and no lens cover.  I realize this is a cheap camera, BUT...

4. Fuji offered a rebate for a free card reader which would be delivered in 4 to 6 weeks.  The reader finally arrived five months later.  In the meantime, I had become so impatient with the serial downloads that I went to the store and bought a card reader anyhow!

If you have very low expectations, then this camera may suffice.  Otherwise, I recommend saving your money and buying a digital camera in the $450 to 600 range.<br><br>
