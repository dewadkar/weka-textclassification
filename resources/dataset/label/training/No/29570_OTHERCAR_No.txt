            My Vivitar 2700 is now broken - the battery door is gone, and the display is cracked - but I can honestly say I don't miss it much. I bought it at an online auction for about $100, so it didn't set me back much, but I was also very disappointed with it. It is a very simple camera, that takes low quality shots. Occasionally it did actually give me really good looking shots, but there was no system to when it produced good shots and bad shots... not one that I could figure out anyway :-) It is a very basic camera, and if you get it, don't expect anything to turn out like what you would expect from a non-digital SLR or point-and-shoot. The pictures I got most of the time were grainy, lacking in colour and contrast, and generally looked just boring. It is a fairly small camera, but there are smaller and better cameras around today.
The 2700 eats batteries, especially if you use the LCD display a lot. Keep a lot of extra batteries around! Transferring pictures from camera to PC is fairly easy, although it is obvious that Vivitar didn't exactly kill themselves when they designed the software ;-)
So, take it for what it is - a cheap digital camera, with quality to match.<br><br>
