            This car is cool.  It definitely has a round �funny� kind of styling that stands it out in a crowd of boring designed cars.  First time I saw it, I was interested in the car.  I saw myself commuting, shopping and hauling things on weekends with joy.  

So recently I went to a Chrysler dealer looking to buy this car.  After calling about four dealers, I was able to find a location with a car in stock that I could not buy, but at least take a look at and test drive.  

I arrived at the dealership and found the lack PT Cruiser with several parties looking at it.  I could not believe how much interest this car stirs for the car-buying population, even after six months of introduction.  

I gave the car a look, and I really like the features.  The interior was pretty neat with the white speedometers, and the upright seats.  The outward visibility is great, except the sloping front fender does not let you see how far the front corners extend.  The rear seats and the rear storage were adequately spacious for me.  

Then came the test drive.  My wife and I hopped in and got on a pretty busy local road.  The first impression was that the car was more solid and stable at in-town speeds.  Then the road cleared up, so I stepped on the gas, and went��.nowhere.  This car is slow!  I�ve driven a neon with I believe the same engine, and Chrysler was able to make a good, peppy city commuter, but the same engine in this car was sluggish, and with a mismatched automatic, this car was outright slow.  That really turned me off and after the test drive; my wife and I decided to leave.  

The car I think still looks cool, but the four-cylinder engine was way too underpowered in the PT Cruiser.  I wonder whether Chrysler ever tested this car while they were in the design and production process.  I understand that this car was a parts bin car (in terms of the drive train), but I cannot believe mundane this engine makes this car feel.  I think I will reevaluate this car when Chrysler decides to add a V6 under the hood.
