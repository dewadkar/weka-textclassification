            The <b>defects, recalls, and failures</b> we've experienced with our <b>4 door, 4WD 1995 S-10 Blazer</b> make us argue over who's going to get &quot;stuck&quot; (sometimes literally) with it on any given day.  

On the positive side, I like the way it drives compared to my 1991 GMC S-15 Jimmy, a slightly more truck-like GM predecessor.  The air conditioning is very strong, and the Blazer has enough room inside for me to sleep in the back when I get to my campsite late and I don't want to set up the tent (I'm 6'2&quot;).  It even gets decent gas mileage for a truck (16-21MPG).

On the other hand, the cargo space can be a bit cramped.  The floor heater vent blows right onto the driver's ankle, and you can't escape the cold or hot air without taking your foot off the accelerator.  The car &quot;leaks&quot; air in through this vent, so on warm or cold days you need to have the A/C or heater running.  The transmission sticks out so you can't quite put your heel directly under the accelerator pedal, which aggravates my knee, and the driver's heel wears a hole through the floor mat and carpeting.  Braking can be a dicey affair, especially in four wheel drive (apparently there's an issue with the ABS contributing to loss of traction).  The four wheel drive is relatively ineffective, even in low gear (if any one tire can slip, you may be stuck down in that canyon, no matter how many people just drove out ahead of you in all sorts of vehicles).  

In the time we've owned it, there have been at least <i>7 recalls </i>:

<b>Service Bulletins</b> (over 220 since we bought the vehicle in October 1994)
(Checking for recalls and Technical Service Bulletins on any car can be done through: <b><i>http://www.alldata.tsb.com/TSB/yr.html</b></i>).  In spite of the commercials touting the chip-resistant paint, the paint is chipped and neither the factory warranty nor the expensive &quot;bumper to bumper&quot; additional coverage we purchased covered defective paint wear down to the metal at every door jamb within the first couple of months (having done nothing more aggressive than drive it skiing on a couple of weekends).  

We've gone from dealer to dealer seeking acceptable service (we keep getting charged for a dealer's misdiagnosis).  <b>We recently had a door lock fail ($4-500), the alternator failed ($3-400), the windshield wiper motor failed (and the dealer argued that it wasn't covered by the windshield wiper motor recall), the brake rotors were badly warped and needed to be replaced, the differential is leaking, interior map lights seem to have electrical connection problems, the &quot;service engine soon&quot; and &quot;check air bag&quot; lights come on for no apparent reason, and these are just the recent items that are fresh in my mind.</b>  The funny thing is, GM has a great program to call every person who receives service, and it seems like we have something to complain about nearly every time and give permission for our name to be given to the dealer, and they never follow up.  What a great way to show the customer that you <i>really</i> don't care!

It appears that most of the recalls were in the first year, so perhaps the lesson to be learned is to be cautious regarding vehicles that are brand new models in their first few months of sales, when not all of the bugs may have been worked out.  On the other hand, <b>our 1995 Maxima has had no major recalls and nothing ever seems to break on it; we just add gas and change the oil (and 30k scheduled maintenance is $200 less).</b>  As much as I hate to admit it, maybe the mistake was to buy another poorly designed, poorly built American car.  I don't know what we would have done if we didn't have a third car for much of the past couple of years.

One thing I vow never to do again is buy a car onsite at a Chevy dealer.  We knew what we wanted and were willing to pay, and simply wanted to walk in and sign the paperwork and be gone.  They played the &quot;let me check with my manager&quot; game for hours.  They insisted that they were giving us maximum high blue book trade-in value of $10k on the Jimmy and even pretended to call other dealers to see if they'd pay more (we didn't know at the time they owned other dealerships), then they put it on the lot for $15000 (a $5000 markup, when Consumer Reports and similar sources say that dealers are comfortable making 3%, or about $750 on a $25k new car sale).  Then they gave us the hard sell on the extended &quot;bumper to bumper&quot; warranty, which never seemed to cover anything (maybe if we had received a defective bumper...).  They even tried to tack on a couple of &quot;document processing fees&quot; (a commission to the guy who was trying to sell us the lease?), then I believe they sold us floor mats for $75, after we had a final agreement and handshake.  It was grueling, humiliating, it effectively wore us down and did make us more likely to say &quot;yes&quot; to anything in order to escape, and 5 hours later we drove off in our shiny new car, feeling violated (reinforced when we found out how much they had nailed us on the trade-in value).  What a nightmare!  

Hopefully we'll be able to order our next vehicle off the Internet, for delivery to our driveway.  I'll certainly buy a consumer-tested model and check here for user experiences.

Update 3/15/00:
In the short time since this review was written, we've had to replace a rusted-through muffler (never had that happen before with so few miles), the rear passenger door lock has started malfunctioning, and the transmission has developed a slow leak that stains the pave ment wherever we park.
