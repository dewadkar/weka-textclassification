            We had the misfortune to rent a Buick Century LTC for a month last summer. It was incredibly small, little leg room, tiny back seat. Our two car seats for our children barely fit. My husband and I rode shoulder to shoulder in this &quot;luxury&quot; car. Loaded with leather and options, it was a waste of engineering and design. It was so tiny, long car trips were uncomfortable. The Century LTD was pretty powerful, terrific on turns, fair on gas mileage (about 27 mph highway).It's a terrific car for one person, maybe two very short people, but terrible for a family. It offered a quiet ride, powerful air conditioning, but too little space. Not my idea of a luxury car in the least.<br><br>
