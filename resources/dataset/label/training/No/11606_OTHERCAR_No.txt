            I have tried two models of the Casio Digital Camera to take some photos for my web design works, a QV-700 and another older model. Fortunately I just borrowed it from my friend. I said fortunately because the camera's quality is below my expectation. I met the problem about the automatic light adjustment function which always works improperly. Some pictures I took are dim and unclear. I also met this problem in the old model of Kodak's camera but never met this problem in Sony's and Rico's camera. When I got pictures from the camera, the resolution of the picture did not meet what it should be. While Casio said I can get 640*480 pixel image, yes I could, but the quality is unacceptable. The picture is distorted and unclear. I myself, somewhat disappointed about this point.

The worst is that the camera consume A LOT OF alkaline battery. I spent a pack of battery (4 batteries inside) for taking only 14 to 16 full resolution pictures. Compared to the use of the positive film, it might cost the same or higher price in my country.

The things I think it's goodness is its ease of use and convenience to take some quick snapshot. Just for fun, not for professional work.<br><br>
