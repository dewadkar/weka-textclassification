            I leased a 1998 Toyota Camry LE with the 4 cylinder engine in September of 1998.
The Car has been a total nightmare when driving into any driveway, over speed bumps, or dips in the road. When going over these items the car always bottoms out with 2 or more people in the car. I have taken this car in approx. 10-13 times for this same problem only to get a the remark from the Dealer &quot;You should drive slower or maybe enter the driveway at an angle&quot; If I wanted a lowered car I would have bought one. After about a year of this problem the 1999 models came out and the suspension on those had been raised.

I went back to the dealer to which they advised &quot;Yes the suspension has been raised on the 1999 models because of the complaints on the 1998 models. But, we cannot modify the suspension on the 1998 model because that would void your warranty.

Other than that and the radio being replaced 3 times in the last 2 years for buttons breaking the car drives excellent on the open road as well as in the City.

When the car goes back on the lease in 2001 you can be assured I will not be leasing another Camry.

Who should buy this vehicle - People with lots of patience and no friends to add weight to the car.<br><br>
