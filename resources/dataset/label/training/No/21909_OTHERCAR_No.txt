            I wanted to give a used car perspective on this model.
I purchased it in April of 2002 with about 35k on the car. BMW performed their usual inspection and repairs on the car. I was presented with a car that looked so new it was unbelieveable.

In the 6 months I have had the car, the following has happened:
Rear automatic locking mech. jammed. In the shop for 3 days

Rear passenger window would not roll up. In shop for 2 days.

Rear drivers window would not roll up. In shop for 2 days.

Check engine light came one. Pipe replaced before resale was clamped too hard and shattered. In shop for 1 week.

Driver's seat control knob broke off and the seat stopped moving. I was told that this was not covered under warrenty and paid a $600 repair bill.

Lest you think I have a lemon, my numerous trips to the BMW dealer has put me in contact with more people with the same story who also happen to own the 2000 5 series.

Driving the car is wonderful. Its ike no other car I have ever drove.
If you do not mind and can afford the repairs, go for it. Otherwise, think twice.
