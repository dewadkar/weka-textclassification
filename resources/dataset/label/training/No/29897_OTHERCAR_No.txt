            <p> I saw this camera in an ad circular and was astounded: A 2.0 megapixel camera with LCD display for only $75? Needless to say, I ran to the store and snapped up their very last one. Now I wish I had stayed home. 
<p> I wanted this camera primarily to take pictures of items to sell on eBay. Trying to get detailed pictures with it is impossible. I ended up with horrible, fuzzy blurred photos. If the item you want to capture is smaller than a person, then forget it. This camera just cannot do it. 
<p> This camera is also not good in low light. It has a supposed "indoor" setting, but I didn't notice a difference at all. And the shutter lag is ridiculous. It takes a good full second or more to take a picture after the button is pressed. You need a really steady hand or the image comes our blurred. 
<p>Now, as disappointed as I was with this camera, I think if I had bought it with a different purpose in mind, I would have been satisfied. (After all, I did pay only $75). I took this camera camping and was pleased with the results. It took awesome pictures of nature/people even on the lowest resolution setting. The batteries (2 AA rechargeables) lasted and lasted. And it was small enough to fit in my pocket. This would be a great camera for someone that only wants to take pictures of family or landscapes.
