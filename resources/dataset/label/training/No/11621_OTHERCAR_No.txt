            Maybe it is just that our 1994 Suburban is a lemon, but let me summarize what we've had to replace on this heap:  3 starters, 2 air conditioning compressors, 1 windshield wiper motor (ever tried driving in a heavy rainstorm with no windshield wipers and a four year old saying &quot;mama, why are you saying those bad words?), the rubber gasket around the back door (there wasn't one - ah, the smell of mildew), a water pump, and one fuel pump part that was made out of aluminum so cheap that it collapsed and had to be drilled out and replaced (the mechanic said he was constantly replacing those things on Suburbans.) That's just the unusual stuff, not the wear-and-tear kind of things you'd expect.

There are at least two annoying but not dangerous things we've not had fixed:  the motor that makes the driver-side power window go up and down (this makes drive-through fast-food windows and parking garage ticket machines fun) and the part of the hinge on the back doors that would keep the door from swinging shut and banging me in the posterior every single time I'm trying to get something out of there.

Another beef I must mention is that the brakes are inadequate for the size and weight of this vehicle. If you have to really slam them on, they make an odd groaning noise, lock up for a second, and then work. There have been many times when I've been uncertain whether they were going to work in time.

We got the Suburban because we needed it, and frankly I'm not sure what other vehicle is going to be big enough (we have three kids in car or booster seats.) Overall, however, I'm so sorry we ever bought this thing. Don't make our mistake.
