            Researched SUVs for 9 months...drove everything...ended up buying our first SUV, our DREAM SUV, the Durango.  Too bad it turned out to be such a pile of junk.

Dodge lures people with lots of power and great looks.  I will give those 2 things to the Durango...it IS, if nothing else, powerful and good looking.  I will also give it roomy with lots of neat compartments for your stuff.

Starting at 1200 miles until we traded it at 20k we had nothing but problems.  Cupped tires, always out of alignment (no off-roading either) steering column replaced 4x, power windows working intermittently, fog light switch out, intake manifold replaced, large paint chips, ball joints replaced, brakes not working properly.  Is that the kind of car you want to own after your 3 years/36k miles are up?  I tell you, I couldn't AFFORD to own this vehicle were not the repairs covered by warrantee.  What happens after that warrantee period if the car's always in the shop in the first 20k miles?

Owning this vehicle was nothing but stress.  Of course I always looked good driving it (and after all...that's what's important, right?)

The ride was bone jarring and skittery.  You felt every bump in the road.  It had a tendency to feel like it &quot;lost the road&quot; on bumps and then regained traction.  

The rear air was a nice option but otherwise you don't get very many goodies (I owned the top of the line). No heated seats or driver side memory seat, no power passenger seat.  Rear seats don't recline.  Air conditioner was anemic.<br><br>
