            After our second child was born, we decided to purchase an inexpensive minivan.  We figured we would trade up in a year.  Our local independent dealer had a red 1993 Dodge Caravan and I fell in love! 
It was a very basic model however.  I love that it has air conditioning, cruise control, a tailgate release button, map lights and the seats were comfortable (all of them; my husband and I took turns riding in all the seats during the test drive), you sit up higher than in a car and you can see well because of all the windows.  It has a storage bin under the front passenger seat that locks, 2 cup holders near the ashtray, a small storage bin near the ashtray, 2 small storage bins in the rear at the ends of the third seat and 1 small storage bin beside the middle seat.  There are 6 cup holders-2 by each storage bin.  I do really enjoy having all that storage room since we have 2 kids and lots of stuff.
The middle seat sits up high enough that you can put plastic storage bins underneath to hold food and drinks.  I do miss having a trunk to put jumper cables and tools in.  The back seat can be moved forward so there is more room for storage in the rear and the back seat also folds down easily.  The ride was fairly comfortable considering it is an inexpensive van.
What I dislike (beware-long list): lack of power because of the 4-cylinder engine.  I have since found out that you should never have a 4-cylinder engine in a minivan. It was a short van although I didn't realize that at the time of purchase.  I think the extended van might give a better ride.  The door locks and windows are both manual. The front stereo speakers fade in and out. 
My biggest complaint was the amount of time this van has spent in the shop since we've only had it less than 4 months.  About 2 weeks after purchasing it, it started missing like it wasn't getting enough fuel.  I thought it was the fuel filter, so I had it replaced, but it didn't help although the filter was clogged.  Next we had the distributor cap, the timing chain, the fuel pump and the TPS switch replaced.  It still had the same problem.  Finally someone figured out that the oxygen sensor was bad and the problem was fixed.  Luckily the van was still under the 30 day warranty from the dealer.  Now it's in the shop with a cracked head.  It will cost $1000 to repair.  After this repair, we're trading for a Villager or Windstar. The mechanic told me that the next thing to go on this Caravan would be the transmission and it would cost around $2000.  It also needs new brakes in the rear so we've had a host of problems in the short time we've driven it.  I've probably gotten to drive it just a few weeks total because of all the time it has spent in the shop. 
I was so excited to get a minivan finally and it has been a big disappointment.  I should've researched this particular model on the internet and asked my mechanic for suggestions before purchasing a Caravan.  I have since read on the internet that the 1993 Caravan is notorious for having  the head crack and the transmission go bad.<br><br>
