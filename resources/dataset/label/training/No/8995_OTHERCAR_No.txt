            This is not a good SUV to use running around the mountain.  The overall impression I have of the KIA Sportage is a poor one.  I had the longest test drive you can have: a rental car.  I drove over 1,100 miles in eleven days throughout the San Francisco area, Sacramento and north to Eureka.  There were just over 6,500 miles on the odometer when I rented it.  This was a four door.

<b>The Good</b>
This car seemed to be well suited for city driving.  With its small size, I could easily pull into any parking space.  If I needed to &quot;Flip a U&quot; I never had to worry that I would come too close to the curb on the other side of the street.  Brakes were very responsive, which may be simply a factor of the newness of the car.  Although it is a little SUV, there was plenty of room for a man 6'2&quot; to feel comfortable driving.

Other incidentals: the ashtrays were removable, which I found out because the car had not been totally cleaned.  Also all of the doors unlock by turning the key in either door, and they all lock when the driver's side lock is pushed down.

<b>The Bad</b>
However, there are no &quot;lock switches&quot;.  This means that if I opened the door from the passenger side and wanted to open or lock the other doors, I had to reach over to the driver's side lock or pull out my key.  Very inconvenient.  Why have power lock capability for only one door?

Also, the doors would not shut all the way unless I slammed them or shut them very firmly.  This was very aggravating, especially since I had to unlock the door and shut it again.  I was sick of doing this after having to do it five times in an afternoon.  Finally I just started slamming the door as hard as I could.

Although this was a new car, the dome light didn't work.  Probably a minor repair and a warranty would cover it, but what a bother.  Another electrical problem was the warning light indicating that the back hatch was open was constantly on.  Although we slammed the back tightly and lowered it gently, the light always burned.  The rental agent said it might be electrical, but there could have been something wrong with the latching mechanism.

If that were the case, it wouldn't be a surprise.  The back was difficult to shut.  There were two parts: the first was the hatch door, the second was the spare tire.  Both of these had to shut (obviously) but usually I had to try two or three times to get them properly latched.  I finally gave up putting luggage in the back area, which was pretty small anyway.

The backseat was small too.  Although there was plenty of room for the 6;&quot;2 driver, I didn't have any when I sat in the back.  I am 5'6&quot;, and my knees were squished if I sat behind the driver or the shorter front passenger.  Fortunately I only had to sit in the back once.

<b>The Ugly</b>
Although I liked driving this car in town, I didn't like driving it on the freeway at all, much less winding, curving roads.  There is a higher rollover risk, and I did not like the feeling of the car when I went around a turn, even smoothly at the posted speed limit.  

Driving the speed limit was never a problem because this car has extremely poor acceleration.  Several times I was flooring it to get up a hill, flooring it to get to 60 when the limit was 65.  I didn't do that too much because I didn't want to waste gas or listen to the engine scream, but what about when I wanted to merge onto the freeway?  Acceleration was poor then too.  You have to get from 40 to 70 very quickly, and I was nervous in my little lawn mower.

Finally, there was a nice blind spot in the back.  The spare tire and the wide strip of body frame at the back hatch somehow made me feel like I couldn't see anything.  I found this ironic, since I have often driven a full size suburban filled to bursting with opaque cardboard boxes, never feeling like I had a blind spot.  I guess it was some trick of the construction of the vehicle.

<b>Conclusion</b>
In all, I am glad I only rented this car and don't own it.  I only liked it while driving in the city.  I prefer a vehicle that isn't so high and narrow (hence the rollover risk), has better acceleration, power locks, and more leg room in the back seat and space in the trunk.
