            I own a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The rotors snapped while I was driving 55 mph on the highway.  I veered off of the road, went down an embankment, almost flipped over, and landed in the middle of railroad tracks.  ten 
minutes earlier, my 13 month old granddaughter was in the car.  Luckily no one was hurt or killed.  I called Mick's Jeep/Chrysler in Pittsburgh and was swore at and hung up on.  When I contacted Chrysler, they looked at 
the car and said it was a defect in the jeep's brakes and they would pay to have the brakes repaired, but they would not pay for any of the damage 
that was done to the car.  They were extremely rude and uncooperative.  In light of the recent Firestone situation, I expected them to be more 
concerned about the safety of their consumers and their reputation as a corporation.  Almost every member of my family owns jeeps and they have 
all had problems.  I will never purchase another Chrysler product again, and I suggest anyone that cares about their safety or the safety of their 
family members should not buy any of their products.  Not only are they unsafe, but when you have a serious problem, they do nothing to remedy the 

problem.  It is a miracle that nobody was killed.  Chrysler should have been grateful that they do not have a milliion dollar law suit against them.<br><br>
