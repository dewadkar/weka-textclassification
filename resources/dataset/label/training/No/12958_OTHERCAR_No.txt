            When I took my first chevy Malibu for a test drive I was very impressed.  The ride, power and comfort were all comparable or better to a Toyota Camry or a Honda Accord but at a much better price.  The interior may have not been as nice, but for several thousand dollars, this was not an issue.

I kept this car 1.5 years and put on 40,000 thousand highway miles.  During this time it was in the shop a total of ten times and had to be towed to the shop 3 times.  The electronics in the vehicle NEVER worked correctly and the car was prone to just shutting down and not restarting.  GM said that it wasn't a lemon because it was a different problem every time which was in fact a total lie.

I think Malibus in general may be quite nice, but my was complete garbage.  GM stood behind the car for a while but eventually the dealer even backed away from it.  

I do not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  Had my wife not wanted a Blazer, (which has been a great car thus far) I would have never owned another GM car.<br><br>
