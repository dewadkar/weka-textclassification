            When I purchased the CR-V, I was looking for fuel efficiency, dependability, and versatility.  Having owned Honda's quality vehicles in the past, the decision to buy the CR-V was a virtual no-brainer.  The 2000 model has met or exceeded my main requirements.  Some of my particular likes about this vehicle are:

-Excellent mileage for an SUV
-AWD activates when it should and provides excellent handling in
 rain and snow
-Good visibility and sight lines
-Dashboard display and controls are simple, conveniently located,
 and visible

However, there have been a few disappointments that I wasn't expecting from Honda.  If you are considering the CR-V, I suggest you review them.

-The seats are incredibly uncomfortable during long 
 trips (over 100 miles).  This seems to be even more of a problem 
 for taller drivers.  Do not underestimate this issue.
-The A/C sometimes activates when other climate controls are touched.
 I thought this might be a defect on my CR-V, but I have seen it
 on others, as well.
-The engine is underpowered.  Granted, I wasn't expecting the 
 power of a Yukon or an Explorer, but merging onto a fast moving 
 highway is a challenge I'd rather not experience.

Overall, the CR-V is a versatile SUV, with quality features above and beyond most cars in its class.  However, relative to the high standards of Honda vehicles in general, it falls kind of short.<br><br>
