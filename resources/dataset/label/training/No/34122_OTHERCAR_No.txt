            As I prepare to buy a new car, I look back on my years with the shadow. I don't know if I love or hate this car. I bought it in high school, hoping it would last me through college. Now it's been over 7 years and approaching 171000 miles. This car has gotten regular maintenance and has always been parked outside in the elements.

The good news is, she is still running. I find that amazing - people predicted 150000 out of her. In her day, she got over 30 mpg on the freeway, but these days 27 is more normal, and more like 20 mpg city. And she starts up in the coldest of weather. Though the heater takes a while to get started in really cold weather. I have really enjoyed the hatchback style with the fold-down back seats, as this has been helpful for moving, biking, and camping. 

The bad news is, I have replaced countless parts on this car. Radiator, 2 oxygen sensors, alternator, wiring for the alternator, wheel bearings, the exhaust from the muffler back, 3 mufflers, the bar that keeps the trunk open, temperature gauge for cooling system, shocks, struts, ignition, timing belt (off the top of my head). The tripometer is broken, the lock from the passenger side snapped off, the console light for the drive shifter wasn't working for a while, and there is a leak high in my gas tank. Currently, my blinkers are on the fritz, though I just had the light sockets replaced. And my head gasket is leaking. Which means my car's days are numbered anyway, since this would cost over $1000 to fix. If I hadn't know some people that are good with cars along the way, I don't know if I would have had her this long. 

This is my first car, and I have really driven few other cars. She's as basic as you can get. I'm not knowledgeable enough to talk about handling, and in any case, my main concern has been practicality. This car is high on practicality (as far as buying cost and longevity, and as far as I knew when I bought it), low on luxury. She runs smoothly and quietly. For people who like power, this car is not particularly "fun" to drive and has slow pickup. Other complaints include the high amount of road noise on the freeway, and lots of clunking going over rough areas. The ride is generally stable enough for my tastes - drove from WI to TN and back comfortably enough. 

Due to a defective paint job, paint has peeled everywhere which is causing rust on the roof.   

I am so pleased that this car is still running, because it's more than I've expected.
