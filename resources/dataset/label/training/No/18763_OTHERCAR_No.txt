            I bought this product because the online photos looked incredible and I needed a watch. Now I think that those Wrist Camera photos shown online must've been taken with a high quality digital camera and downloaded onto the Casio. I don't mind poor quality, but the advertisement is a little deceptive. 

I have only had this watch for one day, and am ready to return it. Why? Because it's no more than an overpriced gadget. The picture quality is lame, and the watch doesn't even have a backlight! Getting a focussed snapshot is a task. Most of my photos came out blurry. Inputting text and numbers is tedious to the bone. 

A man that I know bought one online for the same price, yet his has a high tech chrome/silver design and a Rolodex-type band. Mine cost the same, but looks cheap with a plain black buckle band. There were no options at the local retailers.  

The cool thing was taking the perfect picture of myself. Showing it off to friends may be trendy, but I see no practical use for it. I really only needed a watch, so I think I'll buy a cheap watch and a better digital camera separately for about the same price. That, or wait for a watch with the works: color, more pixels and a little video.
