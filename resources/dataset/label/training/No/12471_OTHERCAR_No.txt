            We were in love with our S40 for the first 2000 miles. Then it needed  brake fluid.  The dealer found no leak.  Then it needed brake fluid at 3800 miles.  The dealer replaced the ABS pump.  Two days later my wife drifted through an intersection because the brakes did not stop the car.  Then Volvo agreed to replace (buy back) the car and we agreed to purchase a new one.  Then Volvo rebuilt the Vacuum Pump and replaced a fuse.  They still agreed to replace the car due to continued brake problems and our FEAR of the car.  THEN THEY DECIDED THAT Maryland lemon law says that if the car is fixed and passes a safety test, they have no further obligation.  They instantly cancelled our purchase request for a replacement car.  My options were (1) Continue driving the car &quot;It's fine&quot; or (2) Trade it in.  Fear prevented us from keeping it.  We traded a car that had 4300 miles and cost in excess of $29,000 for $17,000.
I lost $12,000 and Volvo doesn't care.  If you want my notes, email me at RStern9007@aol.com.<br><br>
