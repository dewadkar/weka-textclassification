            We bought our 97' Tahoe after doing considerable research on the previous Tahoe model years. We were satisfied that Chevrolet had finally worked out the major problems and was now producing a vehicle that would start to approach Toyota in quality. 

Not quite. After 87,000 miles our Tahoe has had, 1) Fuel injectors replaced (warranty @ 900 miles) 2)Power steering pump (warranty @ 25,000 miles) Not bad so far, but, we have had to replace the brake pads FIVE times. The brakes on the Tahoe up until the 00' model are dreadful. Very bad. The real disappointment with our Tahoe came at 65,000 miles when we learned that we would have to replace/rebuild the transmission. The cost to rebuild the transmission was $2500. The transmission in the 1500 (1/2 ton) Tahoe is not a heavy duty transmission. In fact, this transmission is not suitable as equipment on a vehicle supposedly equipped with a towing package. The transmission on the 2500 series is a much better and heavier duty model and is thought of in most transmission circles as the better transmission. However, when you shell out $32,000 dollars for a truck that supposedly has a heavy duty towing package, you would assume that the transmission is capable. By the way, we never towed with our vehicle. Mr. Goodwrench saw that my truck had the towing package and related that my transmission expired b/c I must have towed a lot. This is how I learned the tranny in the 1500 was in fact not suitable for towing. In my case, not suitable for just normal highway driving. Since, I have talked to a lot of Tahoe owners who have had the transmission go out at between 50,000 to 100,000 miles.

Other items that have had to be replaced on my truck include the alternator @ 80,000 miles. This will cost a DIY around $100 and about an hour.

Overall, I would say that Chevrolet is still a ways behind when it comes to building a vehicle that matches Toyota in quality. I would buy a Toyota SUV in an instant if there were one available that was similar in price and size to the Tahoe. I would probably buy another Tahoe but would give the decision considerable thought.<br><br>
