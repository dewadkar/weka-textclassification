            I bought this car Oct of 99 for $3200.00 and that was the beginning of the end.  I would spend over the next 11 months over $2,000+.  It seemed like once this car hits 130,000 miles everything needs replacement.  The fuel regulator, transfer case (under recall), CV joints and front hubs, ignition module, clutch, starter, 3 sets of wires and a ton of other small things.

When I sold it an entire brake job needed to be done, it had a crack in the exaust manifold, powersteering rack needed replacement and was blowing blue smoke!!  There is also a problem with the second gear syncros in the transmission, it grinds!  This is pretty commom on these cars so be prepared.

Aside from all that when the car was running it ran like a dream and got tons of compliments on it.  I treated this car like a child even though it seems like I beated on it from all the repairs it had.

There are many reasons to buy a Talon aside from all the problems I have had.  The TSi version comes with all the power stuff one could want (windows, mirrors, locks).  The driver is in perfect comfort while driving.  All the gauges and radio and climate control is set up within reach.  I also loved the front seats with the lumbar support.  That however leads me to the woeful back seats that fit no one unless he/she is under 5'5.  The trunk space is also at a premium, so pack lightly.  The reason for the small trunk space is the spare tire, but I guess that could be taken out if need be.

The TSi also pumps out an impressive 210 HP and with a few small add-ons can compete with the best of em' (i.e Supra, RX-7 etc....  

The AWD system works very well in snow for the 1 winter I went through with it.

Get it checked out by a mechanic and buy one with few miles on it or prepare for the worst!  I would suggest having some money set aside to help with untimley repairs if needed.
