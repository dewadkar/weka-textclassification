            On May 7th, 2001, I purchased a used VW Jetta GLS with 38,XXX miles on the odometer.  Within two days, I noticed that the speedometer didn't keep the correct speed above 65 MPH; it just wavered between 60-65, even when I knew from the RPM that I was traveling at a greater rate of speed.  I told the dealership I bought it from(not a VW dealer) about the problem, and they said that they would cover the repair, which was to be performed at the repair shop at which they had a contract.  

The first time the car was there for 3-4 days, while this mechanic replaced a speed control sensor on the advice of some of his friends at a VW dealership.  When I got the car back, the problem was not fixed.  The second time the car went to him, he decided to replace the entire instrument cluster, once again on the advice of his VW buddies.  He did not perform the repair correctly, so when I got the car back, the odometer read 25 Miles.  While he noted the previous mileage in the doorsill with a sticker, the car still had to be titled True Mileage Unknown.  This didn't fix the problem either, and it had been in his shop for a week this time.  After I got the car back, not only did I realize that this had not fixed the problem, but the light was on showing that the front brake pads were worn.  Later that day, the check engine light came on.  

Finally the dealer I bought it from told me to take it to the VW dealer.  There, the dealer took apart the transmission and found that the flywheel that is involved in transmitting the vehicle's speed was cracked.  It would be a $1,900 fix.  Luckily, the dealer argued to get it covered under the Powertrain Warranty, and it was.  But he still shelled out $350+ to have the O2 sensor replaced, too.  This repair took in excess of a week and a half.  I got the car back, and it had fixed the problem.  But then, the check engine light came on again.  I decided to take the car to a different mechanic to get an opinion on this.  He hooked up his diagnostic and stated that VW will not release the software outside it's dealerships to fix the cars, so it's practically pointless to go anywhere else.  But he did say that whatever reading he got said that the car had too rich of a mixture of oxygen and fuel.  He reset the light, and said to try to use a lower octane gasoline (87).  I did so, but it came back on again.  

Finally, when I went to get the car's plates (a month after I got it), I got in, started it, and the air wouldn't blow cold, and when I drove it, the indicator on the dashboard which tells you what gear you're in had all of the indicators lit up.  It would not shift past third on the road, although it would go into 1st and 2nd.  It was towed to the dealership on Tuesday, June 19th, and has still not gotten in for service or even to be looked at and it's coming up on a week that it's been there.  I called every day, and got the same lame story from the incompetent fool of a service manager, "We're backed up, it'll probably get in tomorrow."  It will supposedly be in for diagnosis on this coming Monday, June 25th.  After it is fixed, hopefully the dealer I bought it from will either buy it back, or I will trade it in on a brand new car.  

That curse of a car has cost in excess of $3,000 in repairs in a little over a month, and I have only driven it for maybe 15 days; it's been in the shop for the rest of the time.  I will never, EVER purchase another VW product, including an Audi, and I fully intend on letting their corporate offices know of my experiences both with the vehicle and their service department.  Please don't make the same mistake I did; buy a Honda or Toyota!!!!   

~*UPDATE*~
I received the car back on Tuesday, June 26th, after authorizing the dealer to perform $700 worth of repairs.  These included:  a mass airflow sensor which caused the check engine light to come on, $450.  A bolt on the transmission which was connected to the speed control sensor fell off, causing the car not to downshift and all of the gear indicator lights on the dashboard to be illuminated, $50.  Amid this chaos, a regulator (?) went out on the A/C causing it to not function, $75.  After receiving the car back, I drove it directly to my local Honda dealer to trade it in.  They gave me $12,700, but said it was only worth $11,000 because of the odometer.  Is it any surprise that I purchased the leader in reliability/dependability, the 2001 Honda Accord, after this "little" experience?  I am very much enjoying my new Accord now, thankfully.  My total outlay of expenses is as follows:  $1,200 lost at trade-in, $1,000 initial down payment, $700 repair bill, $265 Jetta payment lost at trade-in, and who-knows-how-many gallons of gasoline used in driving back and forth from the dealer.  Did I mention my sanity?  The total outlay from others is as follows:  $1,900 for the internal speed sensor in the transmission covered by VW, and $1,000 for an O2 sensor, speed control sensor, and new instrument cluster covered by the dealership I purchased the car at.  The cost total for repairs alone is a staggering ~$4,000 in a month and a half.  Please don't make the same costly mistake I did.  I apologize for the length of this, but I feel I have the responsibility as a consumer to warn others to STAY AWAY from these Jettas.  I don't statistically imagine I received the only lemon out there.  Thank you for your time and patience, and please don't forget to rate my opinion or give feedback. Thanks again...
