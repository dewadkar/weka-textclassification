            I bought this vehicle because of the larger size and what I was told about the Corp. and dealership service.  Ever since the sixth month of leasing this vehicle we have had problems.  Most recently the transmission, water pump, catalytic converter, head, and valves have all gone out within two months.  I was without vehicle for two weeks and a rental with only a 150.00$ reimbursement cap for three weeks.  The warranty only covers $30 per day for up to $150.  The rental van costs $60.00 per day.  The dealership doesn't rent but subcompacts.  The service was far from great.  The antifreeze was let drain out and not put back in.  Tools were left on the engine! connections were not made again and all the antifreeze was leaking out.  The battery had to be replaced after the first year and a half.  The tires and/or vehicle has a shimmying and Michelin says it's the van, Chrysler says it's the tires we got a 25% disc to replace. are on the third recall.  The van, upon stopping at a stop sign or other, to park, acts ask if it is going to die.  I need to take it back in but I can't afford anymore rentals and I need the van for the passenger seats.  I watch kids and can't have a little one in the front seat of a subcompact and another on anothers lap to take them to Kindergarten.  I wouldn't recommend this vehicle or dealership to anyone.  I am counting the days when our lease is up and I can go to another manufacturer. By the way, the shimmying is still there and we're on our third battery in four years.<br><br>
