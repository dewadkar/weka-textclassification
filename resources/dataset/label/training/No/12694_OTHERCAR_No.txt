            I bought my 97 Cavalier brand new and have had growing problems ever since.  Within a month of getting it I had to have the driver's side door adjusted (rain coming in), the driver's side mirror fixed, the rear seat belts replaced, the plastic covers where the seat belts attach fell off and had to be replaced, and they put the wrong windshield wipers on at the factory and had to change them.  My car now has 24000 miles on it and in the last 2 weeks have changed the following: a motor mount, a strut, alternator, oil pan resealed,and sway bar bushings replaced.  Well, guess what, it still has something wrong sounds like bed springs when you hit the smallest bump or dip in the road. Also, has a ticking in the engine off and on.  I bought this car so that I wouldn't have to be making constant trips to the garage....What a mistake!! I go to the garage more with this one than I did with my 87 cavalier that had 140,000 on it.
Will never purchase a Chevy again. The car stinks, the manufacturer was no help, and the dealership will only fix ONE of things ie. 1 strut (they sell them in pairs) and 1 motor mount. If someone tries to sell you one of these cars RUN!!<br><br>
