            I had an Olympus 340R 1.3 megapixel before I got the QV3000 and was, in most regards, satisfied but recently underwhelmed with the Olympus (which is why I didn't upgrade to a 3.3 megapixel olympus).  The picture quality on the Olympus, in comparison to the newer megapixel cameras, was fair, reliability was so-so and the battery usage was out of control.  I expected that by upgrading to a 3.3 megapixel I would at least get better picture quality.

I am happy to report that not only is the picture quality with the QV3000 outstanding, the camera is of the highest quality overall.  The operation of the camera is very intuitive, the features are not just "gee whiz" gadgetry (I especially like the feature that allows you to take 360 degree panoramas...it's amazing)and the downloading is lightning fast with the USB.  I used to wait for at least 20 minutes to download 24 or so pictures from the Olympus.  I just downloaded over 100 photos from the QVC and it took less than 10 minutes (or so it seemed).  

I would say that the biggest draw of this camera is the IBM Microdrive.  This is the way all digital cameras will store pictures and it works flawlessly.  I got the camera with the 340 MB MicroDrive for under $800.  Outstanding.  

The one downside is the battery usage...enough has been said about this already, but I still don't understand why these cameras don't come standard with a higher capacity battery package.  

This is a great bargain for anyone who wants high picture quality (though digital cameras still do not take as crisp of photos as film cameras), near-endless storage and great features for a reasonable price.

UPDATE 8/6/03

This update is long overdue...About a year and a half ago the flash on this camera stopped working.  As a result, the camera is useless for taking pictures anywhere but outside in full sunlight.  I did some research on the internet on this and found that many other owners of this camera had experienced flash failure and it appeared to be a product defect.  I tried to contact Casio a number of times and finally got someone to respond to my inquiry.  The Casio rep denied that there was a product defect (even though the camera, at the time, was only about a year old) and told me I'd have to send it in for repairs and the minimum repair charge would be somewhere around $200.  Since 3.3 megapixel cameras were selling new for not much more than that price, I was very reluctant to go through the hassle and expense of sending the camera in, especially since it was clear to me that this was a product defect that should have been fixed by the manufacturer for free.  I went back and forth with the Casio rep to no avail.  I now have a camera that I paid $800 for that is useless...it should have lasted much longer than a year.  I'm VERY disappointed with Casio and would not buy another Casio camera.
