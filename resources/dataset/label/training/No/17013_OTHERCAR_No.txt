            I own a 1997 4dr Hyundai Sonata. My wife and I purchased the car after weeks of shopping and test driving all the cars on the market. I was in the Air Force at the time and the price tag on the Sonata fit nicely into our budget. Not to mention that it had a lot of pep, great steering, great braking, and all the extras. We paid $16,100.00 for the Sonata and the comparable Honda Accord, which was my favorite, was in the neighborhood of $18,500.00.
The Sonata has been a good car for us. We have had a few problems with the paint job from the factory and the original windshield was so thin the smallest rock would crack it beyond repair. However I have seen in Popular Mechanics that Hyundai realized this and increased the thickness of their windshields.
The moment when owning a sonata starts to bite is the day you decide to get rid of it. The resale value of my $15,000 car is now at about $6,200. That is with 67,000 miles which is 7,000 miles over average. Now if I had purchased that Honda Accord for $18,500 it would be worth about $13,250. 
That means I would have only paid $5,250 to drive the Accord, instead of the $9,000 it will cost me to get rid of the Sonata. Thus I will be driving it until the wheels fall off and It truly isn't worth anything. <br><br>
