            I bought my tiburon(which means shark in spanish)in 1997 when they first came out. At the moment I saw my car, I knew I had to have it. If I knew then what I know now, I would never have purchased the car.


The Tiburon is a sporty, sleek car at an affordable price. It's exactly what those looking for a sporty car, but dont have alot of money to spend are looking for. I thought I had bought the perfect car. About 2wks later, I started to learn I couldnt have been more wrong.


A few weeks after I got my tiburon the airbag light started sticking. I took it to the shop and had it fixed, only to have it break again several weeks later. Hyundais standard warrenties weren't given at the time of my purchase therefor I wasnt covered for some of these breaks.


I soon realized that the tiburon also handles extremely poorly in almost any weather condition..snow, sleet, rain, wind or even a light sprinkle. The rear axels of this car are wider than the front end and the rear tends to fishtail at the turn of a dime. I consider this car to be very dangerous in any adverse weather condition. It would be suitable for those living in mostly sunny conditions..say the desert!


When I purchased my car, I never thought that I would have a child. Now I have an infant daughter. This car is in no way suitable for those individuals with children in child restrant seats. Its an everyday fight with getting the car seat in and out of my car. It only comes in a 2 door model, so climbing into the backseat is required to get the infant in and out. Its an extreme inconvience and it makes every time in the car feel like an obsticle course. The seat are slanted in the back and getting the car seat level in the back is nearly impossible..as is fitting in the back seat if you are over 5ft. tall!


I have also seen first hand the safety of this car in the event of a collision. A friend also purchased a Tiburon at the time that I did. While driving in a light rain, she lost control of the car and hit a fence head-on. Not only did the airbags not deploy, but the doors feel off the car! The only recognizable part of the inside of the car was part of a turn signal. To put it bluntly, this car feel apart. I consider this car to be extremely unsafe! 


I would encourage everyone thinking of purchasing the Tiburon to take the time to think about it. Take into consideration your life style before purchasing this car.<br><br>
