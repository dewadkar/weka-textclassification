            You will not believe the experience that I have had with BMW.  This car has been in the shop a total of 38 days since I leased it last May (2000).  There are so many problems with these cars that you don't hear about.  BMW has had to replace the window regulators three times due to 'engineering flaws'.  They tell me the window regulators are very common problems.  They will cause your window to not roll up or to stop midway.  The moonroof at times will decide it doesn't want to open or close.  They have replaced the moonroof motor twice.  The car only has 18,000 miles on it and it is in the shop every other month.  This month, the A/C blower decided to stop working, and I was told that was a common problem too.  The CD player won't eject at times.  The two main problems I am having are a loud rattling noise that comes from the exterior driver door when the car is wet at 70 mph and the door rattle that happens when you go over bumps.  Everyone at BMW claims that these are common occurrences with all 2000 3-series, so if anyone else out there has a 4 door 3-series, tell me if you have these problems too...

Here's the real catch.  I have been so frustrated that I went to BMW North America.  The Local Market Manager that I have been dealing never returned any of my phone calls.  Since I didn't get any response from him, I contacted another BMW NA customer service rep who told me to write him a letter containing all my problems.  What did he do?  Sent the letter to guy who wouldn't return my phone calls!!  His response: If you're that unhappy, sue us.  I have filed the Lemon Law and am waiting arbitration now.

The service manager at the dealership has no response for me.  No one has any resolve for the issue.  The car still rattles and groans, and no one at BMW seems to want to help.
So much for their dedication to customer satisfaction.

UPDATE 12.27.01 -- BMW has just terminated my lease and is going to pay the termination fee.  I have just gotten rid of my first and last BMW.  This is about the only good thing that BMW has done!
