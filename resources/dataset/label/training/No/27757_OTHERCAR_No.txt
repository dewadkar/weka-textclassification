            First of all, I like this camera. I really do. I bought it because it meets my needs, and I enjoy what I do with it. But this camera is far, far from ideal or perfect. I recommend it, but with serious caveats.
<p>
<b>It so tiny!</b>
The biggest virtue of the camera is size. It strikes you immediately: this is tiny. I fit it easily into the front pocket of my jeans, something you'd never event consider with, say, a Nikon CookPix 995. Not unless you have MUCH bigger pickets that I do.<br>
<p>
So this is an ideal camera to carry with you all the time. Mine lives with all my other techno-gizmos: a Palm Pilot, my cell phone, my wallet, and my keys. They're with me all the time, wherever I go. That, alone, is why I bought this camera.
<p>
Because it's always with me, and always available, I've had the opportunity to take many, many hundred pictures with it. And, after a thousand shots, I have a good feel for what's good (and  not so good) about this camera.
<p>
<b>Get outside</b>
This camera has an ISO equivalent of 100. Which means it's like having 100 speed film always loaded in your camera. If you're like most point-and-shoot photographers, you've probably shot with nothing less than 400 speed film for years and years. Many pocketable film cameras recommend you use nothing else.<br>
<p>
This matters because you'll need four times the light with 100 speed film (or the equivalent, in this case) as with 400 speed film. So, if you're used to taking reasonable pictures of little Johnny blowing out the candles of his birthday cake with your existing film camera, bear in mind you won't have such luck with this (or most other) digital cameras.
<p>
Add to that the tiny, slow (meaning that it requires a lot of light, not that the shutter is slow) lens, and you've got a recipe for mostly disastrous indoor shots. I have dozens and dozens of shots that have that deer-in-the-headlights look, with backgrounds which are basically black. These shots are taken indoors, on bright days, in the early afternoon. 
<p>
The solution is to get outside. For years, this was the only way to get good pictures anyway. You don't see many good indoor shots taken by amateurs in the 1960s, but you'll find plenty of reasonable ones taken outside. Image quality go up drastically once you have enough light, and getting outside (during the day, natch) is the best way to be sure you're getting enough. 
<p>
That little flash won't do it. Besides, it's so close to the lens, you'll be in deep in redeye country. Of course it's a digital print and it's relatively simple to fix, but it would be better to not worry about it in the first place. (Besides, redeye is the most obvious of what was an awful, head-on-flash photo anyway. Simply removing the redeye doesn't change that washed out, pale look the flash gave them).
<p>
<b>2 Megapixels is Enough For Anyone</b>
<br>
And it should be enough for you, as well. At least with this camera, you're not likely to get good enough images that you'll want to blow up to 16x20 very often (or ever). The extra image size would just serve to waste space on your storage medium. 
<p>
What do you store, you'll want to keep at the "fine" compression. You'll save a bunch (space-wise as opposed to "super-fine") and won't notice any quality loss. You'll save even more space by going to "normal", but the quality will drop off significantly.
<p>
I get about 50 images on a 32 MB card. Which is good enough for me, most of the time. There have been a couple of times when I wished I had more space, but nothing I couldn't fix by doing a little immediate purging of crummy shots.
<p>
<b>Peer Admiration Value</b>
Carrying this camera around will guarantee people coming up and asking you questions. And the kids will beg to see the immediate feedback of the picture you just took (wasting even more battery life -- though I've not had a problem yet with it dying at a critical time). You'll win friends and influence people, yes indeed.<br>
<p>
But you'll be wowing them with your camera, not with your pictures. They might be impressed with how quickly you can have them up and online (though perhaps not as quickly as the Nikon 775), and they might be immediately impressed with their first look at the pictures. But you're not going to win any awards with photos from this camera (not for careful composition, anyway -- maybe you'll win a Pulitzer for being the only photo of E.T., hence the benefit of being to small and always carrying it with you). But exposure compensation in very, very, very limited, with no opportunities for expansion (like external flashes or other lenses). 
<p>
I've found that, since owning this camera, I've taken more film pictures than before. I used it once to help set up a group shot (like taking a poloroid before a final film shot) which was a nice benefit. I've got some nice (nice, but not WOW) images of my children. I put them on my website for the  family back in California; I use them for my computer's desktop.
<p>
<b>Final Assessment</b>
<br>
If I had more patience, I would have waited. Not that I'm filled with regret; my thousand images have recouped my investment (more or less). Well, maybe I'll recoup it over this next year. But the images are slightly above mediocre. And I attribute that to the fact that I know what I'm doing with a camera. 
<p>
When I care about an image, I'll pull out my SLR. I'll use a flash and a tripod. But when I'm just shooing quick photos of my adorable cherubic children at the park, or riding their bikes, or blowing bubbles, I'll pull this little box out of my pocket and snap a few frames. Or fifty.
<p>
Soon, digital will outstrip film in terms of quality and ease of use. Your point and shoot could (someday) be a digital that's better than today's medium-format professional machines. But that's not today.
