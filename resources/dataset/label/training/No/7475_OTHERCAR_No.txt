            The best part is it was a (brand new) rental car, and we only had to live with it for three days. And, it was Florida, and the A/C was killer.

Now the rest. The body cladding? EWWWW! Maybe it's just my opinion, but how ugly! The design is anything but clean, it's overdone and has too much ribbing. Right up there with the Aztek. The interior? EWWWWWWW!!!! What's with the flamboyantly swoopy dashboard? (The Audi TT is an example of how to make a strange but delicious and tasteful interior) If they couldn't afford to put leather in it, don't! The faux-leather is brittle and looks like melted plastic. Everything about the car was plastic, plastic, plastic. The buttons felt so cheap. The radio was hard to reach.

Start it up. Turns on at least. But driving the thing is like driving a boat. It rolls and has the precision of a 100' yacht. Plenty of power, horrible over-powered steering. The suspension was soft and springy. For a car that tries *so* hard to be sporty on the outside, it really cannot perform.

Seats? Uncomfortable. Bonus: lots of rear legroom. If only the rear occupants had a sculpted seatback, or head restraints.

Traction control? Never had to use it, but if it's as good as the rest of the car, I'm scared.

Safety? Rated "POOR" by the Insurance Institute. The seatbelt failed to work right, allowing the dummy to smash his head on the door sill and B-pillar. His leg and foot was crushed when the safety cage collapsed. The dashboard got shoved back into him as an added tasty bonus. Plus, no side or head protection airbags available. Recorded injury/death claims for the vehicle are very high. Bumpers are poor, ditto for the head restraints

I'd take a Dodge Neon over a Grand Am. But if it was my money, I'd spend it on a Jetta, Golf, or Civic. Those have much tighter handling, nicely made interiors, and aren't complete death traps like the Grand Am.

Good riddance!!
