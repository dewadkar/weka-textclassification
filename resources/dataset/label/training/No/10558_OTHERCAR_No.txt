            When my Isuzu Trooper broke down I got to drive this: A 1991 Plymouth Voyager.  First off I drove this car a lot because my Trooper wasn't in working order frequently (but so was this.)  The only thing to praise about it is its relative economy for a van with mileage in the low 20's. 
Everything shakes: the steering wheel, the transmission the seats, and the engine.  The engine also makes a high-pitched squeal whenever your driving it.  Despite being into the shop numberous times to render it driveable it still breaks down.  I'm supprised that it made it to 150,000.  It would have been long gone if it wasn't for all those trips to the shop.  
The Trade off for the engine's fuel economy is S-L-O-W acceleration.  Expect a 0-60 time of more than 15 seconds with the accelerator firmly pressed to the floor.  The unresponsive 3 speed automatic doesn't help matter's with its reluctancy to downshift.  
The interior is suprisingly tight for a van.  The front seats offer only average head, leg and thigh room.  The bench seats are only suitable for small children since they are low to the ground and offer little leg or thigh room.  The Plymouth is a last resort transportation.  It is poorly built, unreliable and uncomfortable to live with.  Get a 1991 Toyota Previa instead.
