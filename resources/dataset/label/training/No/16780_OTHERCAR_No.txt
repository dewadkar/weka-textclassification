            I Bought this car hoping it would be dependable and economical.  It was~~ UNTIL the Engine started eating the oil!
Let me say some of the good qualities about this car first.
This car was a mid-sized car which served a family of 4 well.
I've had Fords before this and seemed like I was forever putting tires on them due to them needing an alignment.  Seemed with Fords an alignment was always needed.
Good  news ~  the Dodge held the alignment! 
I liked how the Dodge handled the  heavy snow and icy roads  of  Upstate NY!
The body of the car held up great.  Looked like it was new! 
Got good gas mileage!

Every week we check under the hood.  Every 3000 miles or less it got an oil &amp; filter change.  When we got the car we had the transmission oil and filter changed and then again after 30,000 miles.  We tried to keep this  in TIP_TOP shape.....................but THEN..........
We noticed that we were adding more and more oil on a weekly basis.  It was NOT leaking the oil.....it was burning the oil.   We had expensive repairs trying to fix it but that failed.
We were told we needed a new engine and this particular engine WAS NOTED FOR BURNING OIL!  It grew steadily worse .
I had to get the car out of the garage FAST...otherwise I would die with the smoke fumes!  
  The people behind me would pass &amp;  stick up a finger..... however, couldn't  read their lips!!   

It never had good 'pick-up and go' but if you had patience it would get you where you needed to go.  Not good at climbing any kind of a hill..  sluggish.

We had this car for 5 years.  We put about 50,000 miles on it. It served us well, but the last year it became an expensive car. The money we were putting into it was more than the car was worth. We figured it was time to put this car to rest.
I can't recommend this vehicle unless you could find one that is free and can  you can afford to put in a new engine/or put up with &quot;SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES&quot;.
