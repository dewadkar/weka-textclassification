            The Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited is a highly overrated Sport Utility Vehicle. From the view on television the Grand Cherokee Limited looks roomy and comfortable. Definitely not the case once you view the vehicle in person. For those of you who do not know, the Grand Cherokee Limited is a vehicle manufactured by the Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler Corporation is notorious for manufacturing &quot;lemons&quot; (cars poorly built). Under the hood, The Grand Cherokee Limited has a powerful 5.2 liter V8 engine. This unbroken raw power excites many potential buyers until they see the gas mileage. The gas mileage is a fact which there is no way around. On a good day in the city you might be able to receive 10 to 11 miles per gallon. As someone once told me, &quot; You can push the gas pedal and almost watch the needle on the gas gauge go down.&quot; Yes, the gas mileage is that bad! Another common problem that the Grand Cherokee Limited possesses is that of a constant rattling in places which you can never reach. For those of you who are familiar with this problem, it is extremely annoying. No matter how hard you try, its near impossible to fix.I hope my opinions and facts will help deter anyone from purchasing a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. Thank You<br><br>
