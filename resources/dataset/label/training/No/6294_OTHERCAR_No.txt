            Whether you should get this car is relative to what you already have or don't have.  Let's just say that if this car is a good deal for you, you are truly at the depths of desperation.

I had one for 5 years, ran it up to 107,000 miles.  Compared to my previous Chevy (with a similar track record), it was a piece of sh**.  I replaced the alternator three times.  The A/C compressor went out, and even a new one never worked right.  Everything that could go wrong did, usually several times.  Even the turn lights took hours to repair when they went bad.

No more Chevys for me.<br><br>
