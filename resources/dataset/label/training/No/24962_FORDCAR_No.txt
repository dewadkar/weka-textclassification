            I had a '95 Hyundai 5 speed and wanted to step up.  What I really wanted was a '99 Cougar but the salesman was just too much of an idiot to deal with a women buying a car.  So I went to another dealer, and he treated me well and I bought the exact same car that is in the picture above.  Love that red car.  The engine and drive train are great.  The rest of car is the problem.  The whole driver side of my car is incorrectly installed.  From the dashboard to the door to the outside trim to the interior window molding.  I have had them rip out my dashboard to find a rattle, they can't find it but we all can hear it.  They have replaced my hand brake.  They have replace the rear window and molding.  And unfortunately, it is slightly better than when it went into the dealer.  There are now stains on my seats, tools left inside, my manual is now under the hand brake console.  On the up side, it is a guy magnet.<br><br>
