            1999 Chevy Malibu

My friend who got into an accident had to rent a car.  He rented Chevy Malibu and Pontiac Firebird from Enterprise Rental Car from Chevy dealership in North Dallas.  I am going to start with Chevy Malibu.

[Confession]
	I have to admit that I am bit biased when it comes to GM cars.  I do not think GM makes good car and I think that GM cars have a lot of problems and it shows when you drive their cars.  However, I am willing to give Chevy or GM a chance and I did here.

[First Impression]
	Chevy Malibu is like new reincarnation of Chevy Corsica and Chevy Lumina combined.  It is also little imitation of Nissan Altima in some ways.  It looks little quirky but it will grow on you and it�s overall very conservative and calm looking.  

[Inside]
	Like all American cars, Malibu has huge buttons.  It�s front dash and and instrument panel has Chevy signature all over, an outdated looks.  Seat design is old and automatic shifter is the same shifter they used when they had Corsica or Old Cavalier, it�s outdated design.  Seat is comfortable but the seat-belt wouldn�t work right and the car only had 2000 miles.

[Driving]
	One of the weird things about this car was that it had awful tire and road noise.  Tire noise really bugged me almost as if the car had a bad tire.  Car had a lot of wind, road, rattles, and tire noises.  The car just made a lot squeaky noises, which is uncharacteristic of new cars.  I felt I was driving a car that has gone through major repair, bad experience.  I wasn�t sure whether the car had V6 or V4, but regardless, it accelerated very well.  I was very impressed.  However, engine noise was high when it�s revved. 

[Comfort, Assurance, and Quality]
	Car had fairly comfortable seating and fair driving feeling but I did not like the fact that car made all that noises.  The car probably was equipped with bad tires but this car only had 2000 miles.  How can this new car have bad tired unless the GM fitted this car with bad tires, which would lead me to think all Malibu(s) are like this.  I did not like this car at all.  At then end of the drive, I got tired of noises and poor quality feeling.  This car isn�t that cheap either.  I later found out that this car would have cost $18,000+.  I am thinking, I could buy other cars like Altima, Accord, Camry, Sonata, and others.  I would rate this lower than any cars I have ever driven.  I would put this car right down there with Ford Tempo and Hyundai Excel.  I would suggest that you would look others cars.  I think Saturn LS and Oldsmobile Cutless have Malibu design with different names and few minor design changes.  I would not want to own those cars.

I was very disappointed with Malibu.  This car was very annoying to drive.  When you have to drive to get to any where like if you live in Texas, you don't want to drive a car that's annyoing.  You are going to get tired of it real quick.  Sure, this is just a transportation but the car isn't cheap either.  I strongly suggest look at other cars.

Is this the car the &quot;America can trust and knew America can build?&quot;  Hello, Which America is GM talking about?  Almost insulting.  Why is GM keep coming up with new car names with same virtues of Chevy Lumina and Chevy Corsica?  

[Suggestion with your $18,000+ car]
Honda Accord LX Automatic is better than Malibu.
Toyota Camry LE Automatic is better than Malibu.
Hyundai Sonata GLS V6 Automatic is better than Malibu.
Ford Taurus GL Automatic is better than Malibu
Nissan Altima GXE Automatic is better than Malibu.
Honda Civic EX Automatic is better than Malibu.

[Conclusion]
There are better cars out there.
