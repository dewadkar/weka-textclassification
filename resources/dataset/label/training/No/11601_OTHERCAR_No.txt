            Beyond a doubt, this truck is the most interesting that I have ever driven.  Each time is an adventure.  Will it start?,  Will the rear glass raise by its self?  Will the radio work?  Will the wipers cycle one time by themselves?  Will the transmission light begin flashing for no reason?  Will there be a new rattle from the body?  Will another part fall off?  Will mine catch on fire like my friends?  Will I be able to pass a gas station without feeding it?

I am not happy with this SUV at all.  It drinks gas, is underpowered, the build quality is terrible, and the engineering is so 1960's.  My friends do not have these complaints with their Cherokees, Blazers, Jimmy's, Explores etc..

When its all said and done, the most accurate thing that can be said for this SUV is that it is a sheep in wolfs clothing. 

Next time, I buy true American, not a transplant!
