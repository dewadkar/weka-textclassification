            I have a 1991 Capri. I bought this car because I have been told it's a great little car, very little to maintain, and its gas efficient. Mine gulps gas, I only get about 120 miles on a full tank. The headlights wont work, and neither will the dash lights, unless I hook up a alligator clip to the main wires on the switch. I can not afford a new switch, the cheapest I have found is 286 dollars. Also the engine is losing compression. It takes about 4 minutes to get up to speed, and slows down on inclines. It doesn't handle well in the snow at all, or on wet pavement. I have invested since June over $1600 dollars in repairs. It's such a cute little car, and has the cutest design, but I wouldn't recommend this car to my worst enemy. I would love to sell it, but I still owe $2400 dollars on it. I wish someone would take it off my hands. I do not recommend this car.<br><br>
