            To start off I did not buy this car but rented it. The model year is a 2000 with pretty standard options. I drove the early older body styled models and like them alot more than this new designed one. My biggest thing against this car is the steering wheel even when moved all the way up via the tilt it hits my legs and I'm average height. Secondly at night you cannot see the cruise control knobs nor the radio buttons. Also I should add that the driver has little leg room even with the seat all the way back you feel cramped in, and its a fairly big midsized car. It also tends to zoom forward with very little gas and you can feel the wheel torgue(sp) typicall in early 80's front wheel drive vehicles but nearly eliminated in the 90's so why with this one? Also the ride height feels like a small truck. There is very little I liked about this car. I'm trying to think of a good comparsion in this range but nearly everything is better including the Ford Taurus wich I also dislike but could live with it..... Even my Mom would rather drive my winter beater than take this rental to the store...... Also the overall workmanship in the interior is cheap (tried to think of a less harsh word) its what you would expect in a car costing half as much.Also the ride is is fairly harsh for a American mis sized car,feels very unstable changing lanes on the highway to much body role for me.  <br><br>
