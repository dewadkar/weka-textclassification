            The Taurus Line of vehicles started in 1989, the concept was borrowed from the German auto makers. Design a car that was ergonomically correct and customer appealing inside, while being fuel efficient and aerodynamic on the outside. This car had a great start in the eyes of the American consumer. Taurus had been the number 1 selling vehicle in the United States for 5 years, and customers loved it's pre (Euro) body shape that was very very slippery and fuel efficient. But sad to say Ford has lost site of the Target the American consumer's  love of driving and appeal for performance and speed in a vehicle. I must admit, I own a 1989 Taurus S.H.O. and in my biased opinion. Ford should have continued along this line of thought. A family sedan that drives like a sports car. The 1989 Taurus S.H.O was a collaboration between Ford and Yamaha motors that met the theme.
It drove and looked like a family sedan, but had all the excitement and and appeal of a fuel efficient sports car. I still own the 1989 S.H.O. and still fully enjoy driving it. By the way this article was written by a single man, with no children. I pray that Ford and Yamaha motors will reunite for one more encore 2001 S.H.O. The newer Taurus lacks passion in the driving and performance departments.<br><br>
