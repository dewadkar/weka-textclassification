            I bought this vehicle because of its roominess, generous rebates, and looks.  I admit I did know about past problems with the vehicle.  After some research though, my confidence was raised.  Most of the problems were said to be rectified...so I bought.  

This vehicle has been great for driving, and driving only.  Since day one there was minor problems which I fixed myself(ie.leaking transmission line just needed to be tightened.)  The battery went suddenly with 55000km.  No big deal, except the Dodge dealer tried to stiff me with the bill, and make me pay for towing(to no avail.)  Other than that one trip to the dealer my vehicle has never been to a dealer...Until yesterday.  

I liked this vehicle so much I tried to overlook these problems, but no longer.  My vehicle has a shimmy, air conditioner can not clear the windshield of fog very well on rainy days, clunk in steering when initially turning wheel, only when moving slow, water pump leaks, water leaks at rear of engine(very little), recall on o-ring seals on fuel injectors and rail, rotors have to be turned every 25000km, clunky shifts, knocking noise when started in winter cold(was told this is normal), acceleration cuts in and out while in autostick mode(only in 3rd)  The dealer states all this will be very expensive to fix...at about $4000.00  No thanks.     

Needless to say, this has been building up for some time, and I only took it in to verify these issues.  It is sad that such a nice car has to be traded(while the problems are at their beginning stages), and with only 85000km this 1997 ES did not turn into a long term vehicle.
