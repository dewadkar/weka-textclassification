            Ford and Chevy have done a great job in offering their customer a full range of  trucks.  In the past, most automakers offered one, or maybe two trucks (usually a full-size, and a compact) .  These days Chevrolet has 5 or 6 trucks for sale, and that number can easily hit 10 if you count each model and configuration as a separate vehicle.

The Chevrolet Tracker fits nicely at the bottom of the Chevrolet pack, but most purists would agree; this is not REALLY a Chevy truck.

Inside the Tracker, materials are adequate � about what you�d expect for a SUV in the high teens to low $20s.  Stereo is just OK, and while a CD player came standard, a cassette player is optional.
Seats are comfortable at first, but get hard within an hour or two � a full day of errands takes its toll on anyone used to even semi-luxury.  Controls are well placed and easy to use/understand. Dashboard arrangement is OK, maybe somewhat bland while retaining a somewhat rugged look.  The Tracker shines in its versatility, what little room there is (CRV & Santa Fe feel much bigger inside) is used well.  Rear seats fold  down (fairly easily) for all cargo, and with the seats in the normal upright position, back seat drivers will only feel slightly cramped. As an added convenience, the rear seats can be adjusted  to a slight recline position, not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.  

On the road, the Tracker feels like a Suzuki Sidekick � this is because it really is a Suzuki with Chevrolet emblems on the grille.  Sum up the ride in one word; choppy.  Not harsh or terribly unforgiving, but choppy just the same. Ride quality is just slightly worse than a Nissan Pathfinder, and that is a complement for the Tracker given its entry level price. Emergency swerves result in a vague, less than confidence inspiring feeling.  The Tracker sits high, which is nice in traffic (isn�t this one reason you want an SUV?), but there is a slight tippy feeling in corners at speed.  The Tracker comes across as  a mini Suburban, but minus the power.  The 2.0L 4-cylinder engine is just not up to the task.  Also, there is plenty of engine noise at all speeds, and some road noise makes its way to your ears.  Very tiring on a long trip.

Styling is a matter of opinion, but the Tracker looks pretty good.  Flared rear fenders give the Tracker a bit of the Chevy Truck family styling � cute without looking girly. Not that there�s anything wrong with that.

Overall the Chevrolet Tracker is an OK vehicle.  Available as a 4x4, you�d probably have no trouble getting to that secluded cabin or favorite fishing hole.  As an everyday driver, the Tracker leaves much to be desired.  It�s not a terrible car, but when you consider Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4 are priced close to the Tracker, you�re left with very little reason to choose the Tracker.  If you are use to an �84 Tercel and are looking to trade up, you will most likely think all this criticism is un-founded.  However if you expect a lot for $20,000 you may be disappointed - if only slightly.

P.S. Leave off the Convenience Equip Package and you'll save $3500
