            Previously I have owned 4 other Nissans' including 2 Maxima's.  I spent more time going back and forth to the dealer, waiting for a service rep to recheck the car and seeking out another dealership to repair my car.

From the first moment that I drove the car off the dealer lot, I had to return immediately and have the car aligned.  Two days later, we drove the car upstate.  The month is August, and lo and behold, we didn't have any air conditioning the entire 7 hour trip upstate.  Upon returning home, the car was taken to the dealership for repair.  One problem noted, was that apparently, the water that drains from the air conditioner, did not drain.  The water would collect and a terrible odor would be present throughout the interior of the car.  The service manager had to &quot;break the factory setting&quot; so I would have cool air.  Every few weeks, I was told to bring the car back into the dealership and they would clean the drain and put in air freshener.  

Once the cooler weather was upon us, my only means of heat came from the heated seats.  Once again, after several more trips to the dealership, the service manager &quot;broke the factory setting&quot; so I would have heat.  The stale odor was always in the car.  Although we rode with the windows opened, there was no real way to get rid of the odor.  During the times that we were not in the car, we could still smell the stale odor on our clothing and in our hair.

Unfortunately for me, after 1 1/2 years, the service manager left the dealership.  The new manager told me he could not change the settings for the air conditioner or the heat.  I was stuck with what I had.

The dealership felt that as long as they could clean the drains, there were no real problems with the car.  They never took into consideration the amount of time it took to take the car to the dealership, find a ride to work, be taken back to the dealership and finally go home. All this during a working day.

Another dealership was contacted and they ordered replacement drain pipes with the hopes that the cooling/heating system would drain properly.  In order to go to this dealership, I had to take time off from work since they were not local to where I lived.

Nissan believes that as long as the vehicle is running the Lemon Law doesn't go into effect.  They don't consider water not draining from the cooling/heating system and the lasting effects the stale order has on a person or the fact that heat is an important factor in the winter and air conditioning is a welcomed amenity in the summer.  <br><br>
