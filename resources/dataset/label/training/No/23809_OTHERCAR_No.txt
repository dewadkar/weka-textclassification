            I have been holding off writing this review for a while now. After all, Toyotas have always been good to me - my opinion of this one has to swing to the positive side right? Maybe not...

We purchased our 2000 Toyota Echo 4dr in august 2001, with just over 32,243km on it. The car had full service records - all from the toyota dealer, inspection found only a bad belt - which was fixed before it left the used car sales lot.

The car itself is great, The room is incredible - my inlaws have a brand new pontiac grand prix; and they find the echo more comfortable. The centered guages bothered me a lot at first, but you do quickly adapt to their new location. Our automatic transaxle equiped car had no problem clipping along down the highway at 140km/h sustained - seems to be governed to 150 though. Not that anyone needs to go that fast. Peppy little car! Handling is nice, suspension is a little soft for my tastes - but I usually choose to drive lifted 4x4s and sports cars. My wife sure doesn't mind. 

The worn belt should have raised a red flag - hindsight being 20/20. Unfortunately it was a sign of many problems to come. We went through 4 belts in the first month we owned the car - finally the dealer diagnosed the problem to being a bad Air conditioner compressor. It was replaced under warranty, things were good - for another month... The replacement compressor also packed it in; at the same time, our interior dial to select heater output refused to turn. Both problems, repaired under warranty. 4 months later... We can't change from defrost to vent again - back to the dealer. 

All in all, we've had 3 air conditioning compressors put in, 2 new clutches for the air conditioning compressor. We've had new cables, switches and some flapper inside the heating system replaced. The problems continue - our dealer has refused to repair the problems under warranty anymore (as we've passed our full coverage warranty). This is an ongoing fight with toyota canada and our dealer. 

This past summer, we started experiencing some transmission issues. Stomp on the gas - engine revs, transmission wouldn't downshift properly - thus you go nowhere. Unnerving when merging into highway traffic. This problem is ongoing, as of yet we still don't have a new transmission, as they always have it 'fixed' this visit to the dealer. 

Some other little problems we've had - not being able to get new airfilters... Toyota seems to have some problems with this, we couldn't get any locally, and there was only 1 to be had in edmonton (we were passing through). For the number of these cars sold - you would think maintenance parts should be easily found. What was toyota smoking when they spec'd Type 4 ATF for the transmission? We have no choice but to go to the dealer if we're a bit low on ATF - no one else sells this stuff. And its not cheap!

Be forwarned if you buy this car - there are almost NO parts available at your local parts store to do basic repairs/maintenance to this car. The only place you'll be able to get repairs and maintenance done is the toyota dealer. 

Some other words of note - parking lot rash is costly. We got some quotes for repairs to the doors, from shopping carts, car doors etc being banged into our car... And the price was unbelievable. 

Today we sit with just under 100,000 kms on the echo. Will we be buying another? NO. Will we be trading ours in on a new toyota? No. I think we'll try a Daimler Chrysler product this time - as I've been very unimpressed with toyota after this car.
