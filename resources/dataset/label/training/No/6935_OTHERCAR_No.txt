            I liked everything I read about the car until I got to the part that said it was an electric assisted. If it shuts down when stopped what starts it back up.  That could be an expensive maintenance problem.  
    I would like if they would provide more information on the size of the tires, material muffler and exhaust system is made of and potential maintenance of any or all of the car for the life or reasonable life to be expected of such.   It got my attention as an electric car with an engine used to charge the battery.  Sorry I found out different.  I was and interested buyer, and doubt I would invest in a car that might have high maintenance.  I like its looks and the wheel cover on the back, the light weight, etc.   There is no mention of colors of inside material that I have found to read about.
