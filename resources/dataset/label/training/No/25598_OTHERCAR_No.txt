            Leased a 1999 9-3 standard 4 door hatchback in late 1998.  This was one of my "dream cars."

It had lots of nice options.  I've greatly enjoyed the heated leather seats in the winter time.  Nice safety features including side air bags and active head restraint system.  The hatchback option makes for gobs of cargo space with the seats down.  However, you have to move the front seats WAY up in order to get the back to lay flat.

Overall, it's been fairly fun to drive.

After only owning the car for several months, the directional turn knob broke.  It's the knob you use to turn on the windshield defroster or have the vents point at your feet or chest etc.  I took the car in for service to get the knob repaired/replaced.  To make a long story short.  They dealership would repair the knob and 2 weeks later it would break.  I had this problem of breakage more than 8 times! When the knob would break, it would inevitably be pointing down at the feet.  This does alot of good when it's summer and the weather is 95 degrees out with high humidity.  

I would blast the air conditioning, only to freeze my feet and my head would still be roasting from the heat.  The dealership would always tell me that I'd need an appointment to bring the car in.  Meanwhile, I'd drive around for weeks with essentially useless air conditioning.

In May of 2000, the knob broke yet again for the 6th time.  This time, I called an attorney to pursue the LEMON LAW.  Guess what, when I bought the car, the lemon law didn't apply to leased vehicles.  But the attorney was willing to pursue it.  While the car was in litigation, I wasn't supposed to get it fixed so that if they needed proof, I could show them.

Since our court systems are so expedient, it was now October of 2000.  I'd driven ALL summer without usable air conditioning.  In the end, Saab settled with a $4000 payment of which my attorney kept $2000.  I would have rathered been able to turn the car into them early and terminate the lease.

My 39 month lease will expire around December of 2001.  While owning this vehicle, I've had numerous other repair items.  Too many to list!  I'll be so elated when I turn in the lease vehicle.  My only thought is that Saab will pass this car along as a used vehicle to somebody else.  

Saab's Customer Service center is a joke.  I kept getting the run-around whenever I wanted to speak with someone who was in charge.  When I did get to talk to a 'higher-up', it was like talking to a stick.  At least I could have bounced ideas off a brickwall, but the stick I had just laid there. Useless. 

Oh yes, the dealership says when you lease a car, you have to follow the scheduled maintenance.  When you lease a Saab, it's not like there's a Saab dealer on every corner.  The 30K mile tune up cost me $600.  Isn't that something akin to highway robbery?!!?

Turns out one of my dreams cars was one of the biggest duds that I've had the displeasure of wasting money on.
