               I began leasing my 2000 S70 in September of '99, based on the company's reputation for safe and solid luxury. This was my first Volvo following nearly 30 years of smooth driving in Bonnevilles, Marquis and LeSabres. After six weeks of total satisfaction with every aspect of the car, I was suddenly confronted with a continuing vibration through the steering column. At first it was a high-pitched vibration with little force but that changed in time with the vibration increasing in direct proportion to engine load or turning radius. During four dealer visits they exhausted themselves in pursuit of the vibration source; re-balancing and rotating all wheels, checking alignment and removal and close examination of all tires - all to no avail. After each attempt, the dealer would test drive the car and claim that the ride was the same as all S70s. Even the Volvo Technical Representative declared the car normal and advised that my experience and complaint was typical of many first- time Volvo buyers with big American car backgrounds.
   Frustrated and doubting my own complaint, I asked six different people to test drive the car, including a former Volvo Tech. Rep. and a current specialty Volvo repair dealer. All drivers immediately detected the vibration and cited it as not typical of a Volvo. What do I do now? I love all other aspects of this quality vehicle. Has anyone else experienced a similar problem?
