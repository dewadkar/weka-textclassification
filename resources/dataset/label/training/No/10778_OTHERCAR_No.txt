            I drive a Geo Metro. I could use a Suburban as a garage. The size of these things is simply ridiculous. There is no logical use for a car this big. If it is necessary for you to have lots of passenger space, buy a minivan. If you need cargo space, any truck will do, and they will handle the towing capacity as well. 

I have ridden in a Suburban plenty of times, enough to know a few things about it. The space in the back is less than impressive for passengers over the age of four. The seats are not too bad in the area of comfort, and yes, there is plenty of room behind the seats. I have yet to drive a Suburban but from what i can tell it has impressive enough handling for its size.

The only real reason i hate this vehicle is that it is a menace on the road to people like me. I am less intimidated by Mack trucks on the highway than driving down the road and seeing one of the colossal beasts backing out of a driveway. Also, the typical driver of a Suburban is an overly wealthy housewife with a fear of driving, therefore, the massive car. I do not like living with the fact that I am on the road everyday with super-sized Suburbans being driven by scared drivers.

All in all, I would never buy one of these SUV's. The size cancels out all the positives of comfort and drivability contained on the inside.
