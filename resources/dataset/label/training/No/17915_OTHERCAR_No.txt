            When I bought this vehicle I was very happen with the way it drove and my family was really happy becasue we finally had a vehicle that could hold my entire family of seven.

But as I started to drive a little more, little problems started to occur. First I went to close the door once and it didn't close. When i looked around at it I found that the lever that locks the door closed had not opened back up. I figured this was only a cowincidence but then it happened more and more. Finally i took it into a shop and found that i had to get the door replaced!

Next about a year after I purchased it, the computer witch runs everything died and I had to atake to to someone and get it fixed and it cost me a great deal of money!

Please now that you know don't buy this vehicle or any of the others because it may be a persitant problem with all of the cars.<br><br>
