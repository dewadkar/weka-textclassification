            This is the WORST car I have ever owned.

I bought this car with the expectation that it would be inexpensive to maintain, cheap on fuel costs. Boy, was I wrong!!!

RELIABILITY: EXTREMELY POOR !!!!!!!!!!!!

At 60k miles: replaced all brakes, rotors, etc... $800
At 60k miles: new tires $250
At 65k miles: new entire exhaust system $1000
At 80k miles: A/C still screwed up after $100

Now at 120k:
new tires: $300
still needs A/C work, new brakes again, new exhaust.

TRUE GAS MILEAGE: DISMAL !!!!!!!!
I get 24 mpg w/o A/C, 18 mpg w/ A/C: for a 4-banger with only 145 hp!!! P.S.: my prior car, a Mustang GT, got 25 mpg while it had a heavily modified 270 hp v-8. You tell me who engineers cars better based upon that fact!

DRIVE:

This car drives like a sled, a 3500 lb sled that is. It's ride stinks. The only admirable quality of my car is the steering.

We do a lot of driving from our home in Massachusetts up to Lake Winnepesaukee in NH, and after the 2-1/2 hr drive we hurt. The seats are horrible. This car is only suited to driving to the local grocery store by an elderly person. Even then the seats might cut off blood circulation enough to warrant amputation. Okay, a slight exaggeration, but never the less, there's a lot of truth in my statement.

EQUIPMENT:

Stereo: ok for first 6 mos. There after the passenger door made noise when you turned any rock music up half-way.

A/C: Can't say enough that this feature stinks. Barely is able to keep car cool in winter. Truly the worst I have ever seen. 

Without A/C, if I turn the temp position to cold, the fan blows air at least 20 degrees warmer than outside air. Go figure.

During any rain, snow, and other foul weather you MUST run the A/C in order to prevent windows from fogging up. Real big problem, that I now hear about after purchasing the car, a problem that you can't even begin to understand unless you drive one of these pigs.

NOBODY SHOULD BUY THIS VEHICLE !!! GO GET A FORD !!!

In summary, I wish I had my Mustang ! Even my Bronco, which had a 385 hp 460 big-block, was cheaper to own with respect to parts (not gas mileage). If you insist on spending this much money on a foreign vehicle, go get a BMW. Friends own them, and they are actually cheaper than any Accord will ever be. The sticker price of a 328 might shock you, but feign not, they are actually lower cost in the long run.
