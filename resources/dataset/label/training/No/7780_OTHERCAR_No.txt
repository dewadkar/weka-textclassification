            I purchased my 2002 Acura 32.TL Type-S (Non-Navi) in June of 2001. Let me give you run down of its unique features:

1)3.2 liter 260 HP VTEC Engine
2)Type-S Sport Package

That's all the unique features i could actually think of, everything else is pretty standard and basic that all the other cars have.

My motto has always been, "YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!" And trust me, this car is no exception. Almost all magazines, online sites, tv show raves this as "THE BEST" Luxury Sedan...but you have to notice that they say this car is a "BEST BUY," and it is, it's the LOWEST price vehicale in it's class, and that is what catches the consumers eyes. If you pay less, you get less, if you pay more you get more.  

Let's take a look inside tha car. The interior material is cheap, it's get's scratch every easily, you can feel/see that Toyota makes and use better stuff in their cars. Acura uses FAKE PLASTIC WOOD PIECES, they look FAKE!!!. Lexus, BMW, MB, Infiniti all use REAL WOOD. The car is roomy. Seats lack lumbar support. Dash layout is very conservative, typical import car. Interior design is almost perfect except for material.

Let's talk about the engine. 3.2 liter with 260HP. This is a different engine uses in the regular TL 3.2 liter with 225HP. There are a lot of engine tweaks to gain the extra 35HP. Let me tell you the extra $2k for the sport package and the 35HP is worth every penny! Smooth acceleration, Sport Shift for manual-matic operations, Quite, Light Weight, Fuel Efficent, Power when you need it.

Moving on to exterior.  Apperance is an A, looks more aggressive, nice car! Have to say the metal used doesn't seem hard/strong as other cars. Watch out for color differece between metal parts and plastic parts. I have a White Diamond Pearl color and the color of my bumper DOESN'T match the color of my car, they are about 2-3 shades off. Paint sucks! you barely hit the car with something little, and whoops...there goes your paint, and you also get a little bent in the metal.

Other Stuff. One, brake sucks! They have no stopping power! This car has longer braking distance then my Toyota Camery. Two, Tires suck! They have no traction when you need it.Tires will sqell and slide. Fast car 0-60 mph in 6.28sec. Max speed 147mph (anything higher than 147mph, then that person is lying, the car has a electronic control that WILL NOT let the car go over 147). The car is poorly built....you wil hear rattles and sqeaks the first 3 months of owning it...all of TL owners have transmission failures. (you can get more information on TL's at www.AcuraTL.com) Comfort is average, on highway and side streets, not as comfortable as lexus

My opinion: For $32,200...i would've bought a BMW 3-Series. The BMW 3-Series came in second to the Acura TL, in most of all the polls, magaiznes and tv shows because of the price factor, it's about $2k more, makeing it about $35k.  The BMW has SUPERIOR 1) Handling 2) Braking 3) Better material 4) RWD 5)Less power, but just as fast 6)Wider tires.

Just remember one thing when you purchase something, "YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"
