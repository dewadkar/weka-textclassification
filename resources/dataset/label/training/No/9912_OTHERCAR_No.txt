            I bought the MX-3 under a "Need a car to get to school and work" basis.  I bought it with 50k miles and over the few years that I drove it, put on over another  50+k.   For the most part I just needed a driver car to get me here and there.   I had decided on the Mazda MX-3 after driving my other 1988 Mazda 626 to 190k replacing only the altenator(not even a new clutch) before the water pump went and my sister drove it and warped the head beyond repair.  I love my cars and treat them well...oil change every 3000 miles, transmission fluid change about every 10000 to 13000 miles, flushed the radiator every season.   Spending at least an hour to two hours a day driving I put in a really good stereo system for very little money.  The MX-3 being so small is a wonderful car to put a decent system in for a fair price.

The two main gripes I have involve the weak 4-cylinder engine and the transmission.  Many people assured me that it was a very agile, quick, even speedy little car.  I came to found out that they were talking about the MX-3 with a manual transmission, not the automatic.  The combination of the small engine and the automatic transmission does not handle the foothills of Boulder, CO too well.   Also, mountain travel is near impossible with more than one passenger in the car.  On some grades it would never get about 40 mph where the speed limit was 65mph.  The lack of speed was not the only problem, but the engine had to be revved high to maintain that speed.   Basically, the MX-3 was not really manufactured for steep inclines.   There were even times where a heavy headwind of about 60mph would force the car to drop out of Overdrive to maintain the speedlimit on the highway.  Very underpowered for my liking.   

Maybe it was my mountain driving, and my highway driving, or the mere fact that Mazda automatic transmissions are notoriously bad all around, but the transmission has moved on from this life at 104k miles.  After the transmission went bad I did research...everyone loved the MX-3 for the most part...until I read further and noticed that most of those happy people seemed to be driving  manuals, not automatics.   There is a handful of people in the same boat as I, where around 100k miles the automatic tranny gives up.  Some faster than others, and some slower.  I reckon the foothills and the mountains really put a lot of wear on mine.   So now what?  I have put in transmissions in several Chevy cars(blazer, s-10, gmc pickup) for $700 installed, $400 when I did it myself.   Ahh, but Mazda is very proud of the automatic they produce.  Buy another transmission...installed at a minimum of $1900, or if I do it myself for no less than $1300.    Inherently, I have a problem putting forth, we'll say $1500, into a car that will barely be worth $700 more than that when I am done.   We'll see if I can figure something out to cut my losses as much as possible. 

I know it sounds like a lot of complaining, but overall, it has been a good car up to this point.  I am even taking some of the blame for thinking a 1.6L 4-cyl engine with an automatic transmission would handle my terrain.  It is a great starter car, try to stick with the manuals(my research shows me that they last much much longer).  If you can, try for the V-6.  I know a few people who have those that say the are a lot more fun.  

Mazda's, for me, have been typically some of the best cars when it comes to repairs(which are usually, few and far between, especially if you take care of them).  However, repairs on Mazda can be very costly depending on the repair.
