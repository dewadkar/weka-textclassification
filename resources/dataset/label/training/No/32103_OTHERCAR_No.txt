            I was attracted to the 300m by it's look and Chrysler retro advertising.  I looked at several vehicles and thought the 300m was the most powerful (253 hp) in it's class and was thousands of dollars less expensive.  

Initially I was very pleased with it.  Then my 300m started to have &quot;electrical problems&quot;.  The head lights and dash lights would flicker on and off very rapidly.  Sometimes just the outer lights and sometimes just the dash lights.  The automatic seat would only work Intermittently.  But my biggest disappointment was the way I was treated at Chrysler's Five Star dealership.  Because the problem is only intermittent they are not really interested in finding and isolating the problem.  After much heartache I did manage to get some switches a computer circuit replaced.  That seemed to solve the problem but it has since returned.  

I suppose I should not have expected Cadillac/Lincoln/Lexus service from a place that is used to dealing with Neon car shoppers.

If the electrical system worked this car would be a top value. It has lots of power, handles well, has stylish lines and initially got a lot of compliments.  (However no one notices the 300m these days.)  It has a large trunk.  

But I always am wonder if my lights are going to go out in the middle of the night and cause a serious accident.  It would have been worth spending more for a higher quality car than not having peace of mind.
