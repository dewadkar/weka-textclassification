              One of the many duties of my new job as an internet sales consultant involves moving off-leased cars to a nearby lot. Its about a 15 minute drive so I do get a decent amount of exposure to the cars i am driving. The most common off leased car at my dealership is the '97/'98 
Mitsubishi Galant. After driving a few of them, I've learned a lot and felt I should pass the info on to all of you.

Powertrain: D
   The Galant's 2.4 liter four has decent power, but it seems to be problematic after only 30,000 or so miles. Many of these engines already have ticking valves. The engine noise overall is louder than many cars including my old and abused Mazda 626 with 146,000 miles. The Galants transmission usually upshifts smoothly enough, but it seems to get confused at times and will sometimes deliver a very jerky feeling shift. Downshifts are almost dangerously delayed. 

Steering/handling/brakes: D+
   The steering is not terrible, providing a some amount of feedback from the road. The suspension however is not tuned for performance which would be understandable if it rode comfortably. Not this car, the handling is sloppy with a good amount of lean and the ride is choppy. In an emergency sitiuation, the Galant is very twitchy and feels a bit unsafe. The brakes lock up to easily (non ABS models).

Interior: C-
   There is a good amount of room for five adults. Legroom is generous front and rear. Its a shame the seats gave me a backache after only a few minutes. Keep in mind, I'm 25 years old and I've never had any back problems. Plus there is no seat bottom tilt feature such as the one on my Mazda. It feels like I'm sitting on the floor in this car since there is no theigh support. The controls are laid out in an ergonomical fashion, but they feel cheap, in fact the whole interior from the seats to the plastic used on the dash feels cheap. The sunroof rattles and the whole car creaks and moans. 

Overall: D-
   I guess the lease prices on these cars was pretty cheap a few years ago. But the truth is that the Galant is not a very good car. If I were to spend whatever a month, it would be toward an Accord or Camry. They may cost more, but they are much better cars. <br><br>
