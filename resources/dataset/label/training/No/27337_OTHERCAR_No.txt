            We have five children and we decided to buy our 2000 Durango for the seating, 4x4, and style.  Biggest mistake we ever made.  We bought it Jan 29, 2000 and at 6600 miles the computer went out and since then it has been in the shop for 8 times going on 9 this coming Monday.  The problems have been computer, back windows motor replace then 2 weeks later adjusted, motor to wiper relay switch replaced 3 times, motor to the lights replaced, fan clutch and also electric fan replaced, blower to the a/c replaced, seats coming apart, brakes not working right, have complained of a clunk noise in the rear end and transmission.  The dealership has nothing to do with replacing a bad vehicle it all depends on the Dodge Corp.  As the Dodge Rep. made two offers which was they would give me at no charge a 6 yr. 75,000 mile warranty, then I stated that I do not want that as I would just end up bringing it back in for more repairs, then the offer was that they would pay for the reg. fee and lic. fee and a 6 yr. 75,000 warranty and the dealership were I purchased the Durango would give me a fair price for our Durango.  That was also not acceptable to me as we put down a large sum of money and only financed a very small portion.  The Dodge rep even stated that she would have to get creative with this one because of the fact then she offered me what I just described.  Also too the dealership put together two proposals for the Dodge Rep and she said no that I would have to go to arbitration now which I have done and will meet next week.  The faith and safety in our Durango is not there as the computer went out with no warning whatsoever going down the highway with my five children in it with me as well.  Now I have to let family members know where and when I am coming or going because I don't know what will happen next.<br><br>
