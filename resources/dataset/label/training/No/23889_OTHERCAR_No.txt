            I bought a 1995 Millenia S in 1997 with about 40,000 miles on it.  5 years and about 40,000 miles later here is one owner's experience.

I love the car.  Although it doesn't feel extremely torquey from a stop sign, or when you floor it, once you get to 3,000 rpm it really flies.  It's not a dog, just not a head snapper off the line.  But to me it has a very pleasing subdued growl.  Over 3,000 rpm, look out.  This car MOVES.  It is an outstanding highway cruiser because of that.

The ride is excellent.  Very smooth and controlled but without being floaty.  You know when you've hit a bump, but you don't care because it is neither loud or jarring.  The handling is very good for a car of this size.  Braking is easy, smooth not grabby, and good.

I like the steering wheel.  It moves itself up out of the way when you take the key out, and lowers itself automatically to where you had it set, when you put the key in the ignition.

The leather seats are wonderful.  In my opinion, I don't care for how low the passenger seat sits you, but the driver's seat has height adjustment so anyone can get the right driver's position for them.  As long as the front seats aren't too far back, the back seat has decent room.

The climate control is easy and excellent.  The stereo sounds great.  The 6 cd changer is in the trunk.

Appearance of a car is personal taste, but Mazda didn't change the body style often so to me the car doesn't look particularly dated even after 7-8 years.

The hate:  I have had rust in both rear wheel wells that I had to have extensive body work on.  Even living in Wisconsin, I don't feel that should be happening with the rust proofing of most cars now days.

Both cv boots ripped and allowed road grime to destroy the bearings.  Expensive replacements there.  Then later had to have an axle replaced.  Also expensive.

I, too, had the plastic radiator crack.  $450 replacement, and that was getting off cheap.  

As others have mentioned, I too get a puff of bluish smoke at start up.  The car runs great, but makes me concerned about the supercharger.  I also have developed an oil leak for which I have to take it in, and I am cringing to hear what that is going to be.

I am very friendly with my neighborhood mechanic, and he tells me that it is a NIGHTMARE to work on this car.  Everything is shoe-horned into the engine bay, so to get at anything and work on it almost always requires disassembling a bunch of things just to get at the part that needs repair.  That makes repairs VERY expensive.

I really love this car.  It is sportier than a Lexus ES 300, WAY smoother than a Nissan Maxima, WAY more luxurious than a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.  I WANT to keep it.  I really feel that with 80,000 miles on it, if I had any of the above mentioned cars, that I could keep it to 120,000 miles or beyond with little to no repair costs.  But the Millenia S scares me, both from my personal experience, and from what I have read from others here and on the Mazda forums.  Sad to say, but I am going to put the car up for sale and cut my losses.
