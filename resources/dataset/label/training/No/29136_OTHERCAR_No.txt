            <i>This review is not about the Volvo V70 2001 model, but rather of the '97 model </i>
I am lucky enough not to own this car, however, my mother and a friend's mother both own the car.  The problems that my mother has had with her car have been so numerous that she is considering getting rid of the car, so I figured I would warn some of you people out there before you spend $30,000+ on a Volvo. 

The first few months were a joy with the new car, sure, it wasn't as roomy as the van that we'd previously owned, but it seemed like a decent car. Until the trouble began.   Nothing major has gone wrong with her car, just small, small things that have added up with frequent trips to the auto shop. 

1) The electric system on this car is one of the worst there is.  In the three years that we've had the car, we've had the indicators malfunction twice, the headlights blew their bulbs three times, the car stalled in the winter (and in fact, the guy in the tow truck told my dad that the car had a really awful electric system).  This means that there is faulty wiring all over the car.  To add to that, the hood of her car sometimes makes rather alarming noises. 

2) She's had to have her wheels aligned more times than necessary over the course of two years, and she's had to have tires replaced out of her own money. (This may be Volvo's fault, might be DC's roads, might be both) One of the original tires was punctured very easily and was replaced with the spare that Volvo had provided, which proved to be futile, because that tire was also gone in no time at all. Also, their tires are absolutely useless in the snow.  My mother got stuck in the snow going down an almost flat road surface last winter in her Volvo. 

3) The safety is also questionable.  I know someone who bought a Volvo because of it's safety record, and was then involved in an accident. She was hit by the side by a vehicle, and her Volvo spun in a circle.  On her way around that spin, she was side-swiped by another vehicle, and her car flipped.  Luckily, she was unharmed, but she rid herself of that Volvo as soon as she could.  It could have been fatal. 

I'm not saying that all Volvo's are bad, because I know a number of people who've had their Volvo's for years and are completely satisfied with them, but some of their newer models aren't quite up to scratch.  So if you're riding in a Volvo, I feel bad for you, and may you get rid of it to someone else as soon as you can.
