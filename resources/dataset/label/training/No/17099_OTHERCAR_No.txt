            We bought the M320 because of Mercedes' reputation for quality/safety and its good reviews.  

We have mixed feelings about this vehicle.  We like the fact that it drives like a car and is doubtless safe (although the braking seems a little weak).

However, like other reviewers, we note that the heater doesn't direct any heat to the feet; that it fogs up awfully easily for an SUV (which one would expect to be designed for bad weather); that the road noise is pretty high; that the dashboard controls are haphazardly placed. And this may sound like a nit, but at this price I would have expected &quot;driver's seat memory,&quot; so my wife and I wouldn't have to go through readjusting seat and mirror position several times a day.

We recently had a flat tire and were disappointed to see that it doesn't come with a real spare, but a &quot;doughnut.&quot;  Also, getting the spare out wasn't an easy task.

We recently rode up to Tahoe in a friend's Grand Cherokee and got the feeling he got a much better deal for the price.<br><br>
