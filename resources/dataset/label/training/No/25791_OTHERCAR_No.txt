            I purchased the Dentmobile in a thrilling moment at a July 4 sale (after research, of course!) in 1997.  I had previously been driving a Nissan Pathfinder on a lease and had eagerly turned in that gas guzzler in favor of my new 4-cylinder, two-wheel-drive choice.  

I will try to make this brief so you don't have to spend all you inquiry time reading my review.  The Dentmobile LX is thusly named due to the uncanny ability this auto has to attract the smallest of items into its' body, apparently at full force, so as to create craters.  The paint (black) on the exterior door handles has also decided to vacate the area.  

I immediately noticed an incessant squeaking under the front passenger-side seatbelt panel which would not stop after feeble preliminary efforts to make it do so.  I mentioned it at my first dealer checkup in September at 5270 miles, but it was a mystery item (?) to them and not as big as my other queries/complaints.  There has been since that time a surgical rag under the panel at the mystery point of squeakage which will probably remain there until the junkyard (which could happen soon!)

At the same checkup, among other things, I had them check the transmission, as I was having the same problem mentioned in at least one other epinion, and that was/is very rough shifting, intermittently, and from park, the shift to reverse at times seems to clunk the car onto a whole other plane.  &quot;Trans shifting normally&quot;  according to Mazda.

I had to replace all four tires in June of 1999, due to uneven wear, despite rotations and alignments (which don't hold very well).  Mileage at that time was approximately 32,000.

The battery went dead shortly thereafter, and instead of argue with the dealership and wait for the car, I went to AutoZone and purchased a new one and installed it all within an hour of discovering the Dentmobile was dead.  They checked the old battery, and it was dead too.

I had to have a front brake job in November of 1999 at 35409 miles.  I inspected them myself and found the old ones were el cheapo, worn-out pads.  

I'm waiting for the next shoe to drop.  I have changed the oil every 5000 miles, give or take, have rotated the tires about every 10,000 and done an alignment every alternating oil change.  The last alignment didn't take (?) despite my attempts to avoid curbs and potholes, so when I returned it for a courtesy re-align, I asked the tech if he had seen this problem in many 626's.  He (enduring a glare from his manager) replied that there had been some problems in the rear in some he had seen (for what that's worth).  

I owned a great four-wheel-drive Mazda pickup in the late '80's and my dad had two Mazda pickups that each lasted over 100,000 miles without a hitch.  This 626 LX Dentmobile, however, has not been the great investment I had hoped it would be.  

Oh yeah, and I take at least one 1200-mile trip per year, and by the middle of the driving day, I find that I am shifting constantly to get comfortable.  There are also incessant squeaks under the shift console that loud music doesn't drown out.
