            I bought a very clean used (55400 miles) 1996 Mazda 626 2.0 LX (with automatic transmission) in December of 1999.  I bought it because it drove very well and seemed quieter, smoother and more comfortable than other Japanese cars in its price class.  I was also attracted by the traditional almost bulletproof reputation for reliability that Japanese cars enjoy.  

Unfortunately, this turned out to be wishful thinking because the car began experiencing transmission problems soon after I bought it.  The local Mazda dealer service advisor said that the transmission problem was due to a bad design and that they had replaced &quot;tons of them.&quot;  Replacement was quoted at $2500.  

The local independent transmission repair business confirmed the problem with 626 transmissions: &quot;It's a bad design.  Sometimes we have to replace the front pump and drum, sometimes the back pump and sometimes even the computer before we can get them right.&quot;  Repair was quoted at $1800.  Fortunately, the dealer I bought the car from paid half. 

Mazda's attitude is that there is no problem, and there are reportedly several class action suits against Mazda in the works concerning these transmissions.  The car drives fine now, but I feel like I'm sitting on a time bomb - when is the transmission going to blow again and cost another $1800 to fix?  

It's really a shame because the 626 is probably the easiest driving car I've ever driven and also the quietest at interstate speeds.  But I would absolutely advise against anyone buying a used (1993 - 1998?) 626 with an automatic transmission.  If you are determined to buy a used 626, at least ask an independent transmission repair mechanic for their opinion or strongly consider purchasing an extended warranty that will cover transmission repairs to 100,000 miles. Current owners would probably be wise to strictly follow the recommended 30000 mile transmission fluid changes. <br><br>
