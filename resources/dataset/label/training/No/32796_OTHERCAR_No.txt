            What more can I say but good going chevvy.  The corvette is and always has been in my opinion the best car ever made.  They just keep making improvements and they are doing good. In 1994, there were a few problems with the corvette, but over the years, they worked them out and now with the 2000 corvette, it is a dream come true.  In my experience, it is a verry smooth riding car for the motor that is in it.  I have never driven another car with as much power and controll as this.  I have fun driving this car.  I would definitely reccomend this car to anyone.  It is worth the money.<br><br>
