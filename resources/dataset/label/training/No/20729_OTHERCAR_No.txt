            I bought the Blazer because of the car-like ride and the styling. IT IS A BLACK 4X4 2 DOOR. THE GAS MILAGE WAS AVERAGE FOR THAT TYPE OF VEHICLE. IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU CAN PUT ON IT FROM THE FACTORY EXCEPT LEATHER SEATS. I REALLY HAD HIGH HOPES FOR IT. ALAS I WAS WRONG.
YES, THE HANDLING WAS GOOD AND THE RIDE WAS ABOVE AVERAGE. BUT, THE NIGHTMARE STARTED WITH A SQUEAK AND THEN A RATTLE. THEN AN AVELANCHE OF THINGS STARTED TO HAPPEN. AND 80% OF IT ALL WAS FIT AND FINISH PROBLEMS. DOOR MOLDINGS CAME OFF AND THE DEALERSHIP TRIED 4 TIMES TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THEY ENDED UP GLUEING THE PART ON. 
THE RATTLES IN THE DOOR PANELS WERE VERY LOUD. EVEN SMALL BUMPS MADE THE PANELS QUIVER. THE DEALERSHIP TRIED 5.... YES 5 TIMES TO QUIET THEM. NOTHING STAYED FIXED. THE BRAKE PEDAL SQUEAKED WHEN DEPRESSED. THE DEALERSHIP JUST PUT SOME GREASE ON IT. THAT LASTED ABOUT 1 THOUSAND MILES. THE REAR TAILGATE WAS SQEAKING. SAME THING. PUT SOME GREASE ON IT. AT LEAST THAT LASTED FOR 5 THOUSAND MILES. 
I took the vehicle to 2 dealerships. THEY BOTH TRIED. ONE NIGHT.. ABOUT 15 DEGREES AND DARK OUT, THE DRIVERS DOOR WOULDNT CLOSE. I HAD TO DRIVE TO THE DEALERSHIP AT 8PM FOR 25 MILES HOLD THE DOOR SHUT MANUALLY!!!! I CALLED CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE TO GET OUT OF THE TRUCK. THEY DID NOTHING.... THATS RIGHT... NOTHING! THEY TOLD ME JUST TO BRING IT IN TO GET FIXED. THATS all they could recommend.
ALL IN ALL I BROUGHT THAT TRUCK IN 28 TIMES FOR THINGS LIKE THIS. I TRADED OUT OF THE VEHICLE 1 MONTH AGO WITH ANOTHER MFG'S TRUCK. DONT BUT A CHEVY BLAZER. AND IF YOU DO, DON'T BE SURPRISED AS TO THE POOR QUALITY.<br><br>
