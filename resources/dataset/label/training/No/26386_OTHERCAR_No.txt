            I recently had the chance to test drive an Olds Silhouette Mini Van. Or should I say an Oldsmobile &quot;Den/Play Room&quot;. This thing was loaded. It had Leather Captain Seats, Radio/CD Player, VCR/TV, Headphones, and Game System. 

It is a dream van for anyone with children. Especially traveling. They would be in heaven.  There is the VCR/TV or game system to keep them busy. One big plus was the headphones. :-)  For which each could pick what  they would  like to listen to. One set could listen to the TV/VCR, while another was listening to the Radio/CD Player.

This van drove like a dream. So smooth. I took it over railroad tracks known to rattle teeth. Not a peep was felt or heard from the van. Very quite ride.

I have to say something about the seats. The leather is the softest stuff. I couldnï¿½t believe it. It was great.

The features seem endless. From Keyless entry to VCR/TV to OnStar Service I recommend this van to anyone who can afford it and don't mind paying. Because you truly will be paying for it. I was shocked at the price. However, after driving  it, I can sorta/kinda understand.
