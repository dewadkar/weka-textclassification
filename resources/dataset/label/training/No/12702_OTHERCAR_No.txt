            My youngest daughter purchased a 1997 cavalier.  She has had nothing but problems out of it.  I think they could really do better with their cavaliers,  I was really disappointed in this car.  Chevy generally makes great cars, but they really messed up with the 97's.   Our family has always bought chevy's.  We are firm believers that they are best. That is up until this problem with the cavalier.   She has had a lot of problems with the head gasket.  However, they seem to fix the problem, but then a few months down the road, it happens all over again. <br><br>
