            The 1998 Plymouth Neon Expresso (DOHC) was my first new car.  The price seemed reasonable and the car was cute.  Plus, all my life my family has driven cars manufactured by Chrysler, Plymouth, or Dodge, so I thought this would be o.k.  I was absolutely wrong!  Before I even made it one block away from the lot, a fuse controlling the a/c blew and I had to turn around and put the car in for service.  One week later I had to bring the car back because it would start and then immediately die out.  The service department told me there was nothing wrong with the car.  In the last year, I have taken my car in for service at least five times because the &quot;check engine&quot; light keeps going on.  Again, the service department told me there was nothing wrong with the car.  The car's idle is erratic, it threatens to die out, and the engine sounds like it's going to explode if you go over 45mph.  Also, the engine has developed a noisy tick, and less than one week ago, I was stranded for three hours when my car ran out of gas (even though my gauge said I had 1/2 tank).  The roadside assistance provided with my warranty means nothing.  They guaranteed someone would be by to bring me gas in one hour and after three hours when they still hadn't shown up, I gave up and called my family.

I am absolutely disgusted with this vehicle and am going to enter into arbitration with Chrysler (unless I can unload this thing sooner).  I would never recommend this car to anyone, no matter how cute or how great it seems to run on a test drive.  The dealerships are not accommodating at all, and I believe that the mechanics are utterly incompetent.  Buyer Beware!!!<br><br>
