            When the Dodge Ram in it's current incarnation hit the streets several years ago, it was the best thing going.  It still is known for it's pulling power and work horse personality.  Unfortunately, the truck is becoming dated in comparison to current models by Chevy, Ford, and Toyota.  When we were comparison shopping for new trucks in June 99, the Dodge was one of the trucks I believed could be in my garage.  Sorry to say, the Ram 1500 has gone the way of the vinyl record.  Six years ago, I thought the looks of the mighty Ram was awe inspiring.  It still is.  A truck cannot hold it's own merely on styling.  The Dodge Ram feels huge when it actually is not the largest of the Full size trucks.  That bulbous hood really hides much of the road, and makes parallel parking a matter of intuition, or by feel.  The engine had lots of torque, but not enough to haul the behemoth to cruising speed fast enough to please us.  The back seat was clearly the worst of the lot, maybe tying with the Toyota.  <br><br>
