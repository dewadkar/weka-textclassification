            My second Jeep Grand Cherokee was not all as expected.   There were significant design changes which looked to be promising but overall the vehicle was somewhat lacking.   The best change was the spare tire under the floor in the storage compartment.   This gives more space for luggage or weekly shopping.   The rear window has had several leaks and has been replaced.   The drive shaft 'Clunks' when going from reverse to drive.  (Jeep says this is a problem and they are looking at it).   There has also been a problem with the brakes surging when slowing down from normal highway speeds and required the rotors to be returned after only 5,000 miles.

Overall the vehicle looks nice but the interior seems to be lacking.   The previous style (prior to 1999) had a bit more class and style.

This is my second Jeep but I'm not sure if there will be a third.    There are others out there with more options and value for less price.<br><br>
