               The age of 16 is a wonderful time for a 16 year old boy. On 10/24/91, I got my first car, a 1987 Toyota Tercel. I knew it was nothing special but it was a CAR and that was enough for me at the time.

Powertrain: The Tercel had a 1.5 liter 12 valve per cylinder SOHC four cylinder engine. It made a WHOPPING 78 horsepower.This car could barely make it up hills. It bucked and stalled all the time. I later learned the '87 model had carburator problems. The four speed manual shifter was quite precise and the clutch was smooth. The lack of power was much worse with the A/c switched on.

Steering/handling/braking: My Tercel which was the really cheap &quot;EZ&quot; model had no power steering, but the manual steering was rather good. The body leaned severly though. This is not a twisty road sort of car. The brakes were mediocre and they needed contant repair.

Interior: The dash was laid out fairly well. Most controls were easily accessable. The front seats were also comfortable. The back seat, don;t even think about it, small children only. 

Exterior: The old Tercel as well as many small hatchbacks had a dumpy look about them. Some people even go so far as to comapre it with a high top sneaker! The Tercel was one of the better looking of these old hatch designs.

Overall:  When I sold it in '93, it only had 59,000 miles on it and tons of rust. The door handles were falling off and the brake light was on once again. And the fuel mileage, ha!!! Economy car my rump! I was lucky if I got 25MPG on the highway. My mom's V6 powered Nissan Maxima SE gets better mileage than this so-called econocar did.Needless to say, I don't miss it.<br><br>
