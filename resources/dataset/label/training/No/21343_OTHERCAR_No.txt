            At 42k, my 6 cylinder Camry started emitting white smoke and burning an excessive amount of oil.  The Toyota dealer informed me that the engine had "sludge" and would probably require a major repair costing in excess of $5,000.  Furthermore, the warranty would not cover the repair, despite the fact that I had documentation that the vehicle was serviced properly and within the time limits specified.  My complaints directly to Toyota fell on deaf ears.  
A "sludge" search on the web revealed many reports of similar problems with all Toyotas using the 6 cylinder engine.  One well known mechanic with a morning talk show says that the problem is due to an engine design flaw.  He says that Toyota modified their 3.0 liter V-6 engines (in Siennas, Avalons, and in certain Camrys and Solaras and also the Lexus RX300) to improve fuel efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions.  When they did this, they reduced the size of the coolant passages in the head gaskets, making the cylinder heads run at an incredibly hot temperature (over 300 degrees). This literally fries the oil and causes sludging.  He said this happens no matter how frequently that you change the oil.
What otherwise would have been a wonderful car has turned into a disaster and, in my opinion, there is ample evidence that no one should risk the purchase of one of these 6 cylinder models.
