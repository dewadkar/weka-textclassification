            We bought out 1995 GMC Safari SLT because it was bigger than the true minivans (i.e., Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager/Chrysler Town & Country/Ford Aerostar and Windstar/Chevy Venture/all imports), but not so large as the more expensive (and more challenging to garage) full-size vans. Looking back, I wish that we had bought a full-size van, or our other alternative, the now deceased full-size station wagon (i.e., Buick Roadmaster Estate/Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser/Chevrolet Caprice). The lack of front passenger leg room is truly annoying - a constant irritant. Add to that the electrical problem that blew the air bag circuit when the van was only a couple of months old, and seven (count 'em - 7) GMC dealers have failed to diagnose and repair the problem, and you have a disappointing owner experience. I have had very good luck with GM products in the past, but this van has gone through an air conditioner, a problem in the steering column, an engine, and several batteries. There is also an interesting, and possibly problematic design feature that led to the new engine. The automatic transmission is shifted electronically. If the electronic sensor ($150 part) malfunctions, then the transmission doesn't shift gears. You might be standing on the accellerator waiting for the transmission to shift, and wind up blowing your engine. Trust the voice of experience on this one.
