              My family had high hopes when we bought our <b>new</b> Taurus from the Ford dealer. We thought of the great trips we could it this spacious and quiet car. We learned very quickly. The car was the most unreliable thing we had ever ridden in. When we owned it we went on about six long trips with it, four of those trips it broke down. It is relatively quiet and has a decent amout of space, but those are qualities you tend to overlook as you manuver through the oveflow baggage from the small trunk in an attempt to get out of the car to examine the broken engine. Actually the transmission gave us the majority of the problems. It couldn't handle long trips at all. This car is a lemon and should be avoided. <br><br>
