               We have had our Jeep for four months now and up to this point it hasbeen quite reliable. But, recently it has been experiencing a host of engine related problems. A week ago my mother and I were riding down the road, when the Jeep's engine shut off. We pulled on to the shoulder and tried to restart the car, but it kept dying on us. Well, we took the car back to the dealership, and they apparently fixed the problem. But, the next day we were riding in it again, and the motor died out again. Now, our family has owned many SUVs before this like the Chevy Blazer, Tahoe, and even an old Jeep Cherokee, but this car has been a lot of trouble. Aside from the promotional video, which makes the Jeep seem like the ultimate roadster, a basic Jeep package with a few options leaves much to be desired. The looks of the car are undeniable, it looks good, but overall the V6 engine feels very underpowered and weak. We were able to compromise the car's performance for its safety and reliability features, but because of the recent problems with our Jeep, we are starting to question the overall integrity of the vehicle. If you are looking for a reliable SUV, that has a great engine and handles fairly well, I would buy a Jimmy, or a Blazer over the Jeep Grand Cherokee. The luxury and options of the Jeep pale in comparison to the mechanical difficulties and headaches that accompany them.  <br><br>
