            I have a 95 Camry 2.2.

In general, it is a good car. Reliable; solid; easy to drive; reasonably comfortable.

Minor gripes: 

Mileage. Poor for a 2.2. Gets only about 25 MPG.
Glove Box. Ridiculously small and almost useless.
Headlight assembly. Cheaply made; headlights routinely drop to the full down position.

MAJOR GRIPES

AIR CONDITIONING. The Camry A/C is a piece of junk. At 46K I had to replace the condenser, expansion valve, and related items. $522.
Now, at 66K/five years, the compressor has died. Cost for new compressor, labor, and recharge: $ 1,240. That's almost $1,800 in A/C repairs on a five year old Camry with just 66,000 miles. I live in MA and use the A/C only five months a year. 

Utterly unacceptible.

I would NOT recommend buying a Camry.
