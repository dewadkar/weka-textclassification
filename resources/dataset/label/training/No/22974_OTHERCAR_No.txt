            Do you hate trying to make sure *ALL* your objects are in your view finder before you snap that picture, and taking a chance on the moment passing without catching it?

THEN IS THIS MIGHT BE CAMERA FOR YOU! 

I was oblivious to what a digital camera was, until took a look at the Polaroid PDC-640. This camera was so easy to use. The LCD on the back of the camera lets you take virtually flawless pictures without taking the extra time to use the viewfinder.

Most camera's I had looked at were completely out of our price range.  A friend clued us in on the bargain at Walmart where they had/have the camera for $110.00 (plus tax).  Finally, I found a complete set up for the camera for a price we could afford.

My husband and I had become interested in auctions at eBay.com.  I found a lot of items interesting and thought, "HEY, I can do that."  We purchased the camera and have used it more than our *35MM Film* camera's.  I use this camera at least once a week to take pictures of items we auction, and add more pictures to my screen save picture program.

This camera is also nice to send pictures of family that don't live close.  You can take, load the pictures to the computer, insert them in email in a matter of minutes. Not to mention now they have online services that you can send them too and they will send you prints for a nominal fee.

Since we are a shutter bug family, and have twins, being able to store the pictures on the computer has been much more handy than the process of getting film developed and storing the pictures. Not to mention, now if there are particular shots you cherish you can have them made into prints, simply upload them to a developer and they can send your pictures to you or family members.

The only dislikes I have about this camera is the quality of the pictures the more exposures you take.  There are several different settings on this camera that allow you to take anywhere from 12 exposures to 96 exposures.  The more exposures the less quality.  The other dislike I have is it tends to suck your battery life (four at a time) in a short period of time. 

UPDATE 2/15/01: I have one other flaw with this camera. I have been through two of these camera's now. These camera's are NOT Shock resistant friendly. Both of the cameras I got were dropped not more than 6 inches and both of them no long work.  We updated to the Panasonic Palm cam, I will write another review of this item.  

I can no longer recommend this camera, unless you are just getting started with a digital camera and have the capabilities of being very careful with the camera. This might make a nice gift for a beginner, but an upgrade would probably be necessary if they ever bumped or dropped it.

I enjoyed my cameras for a year (6 Months Each)!
