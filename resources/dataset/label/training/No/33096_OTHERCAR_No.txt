            I had to write this because the other people here seemed to think this car is the greatest, but I would have to beg to differ. I got my car at a wholesale car place where my brother worked at in Ill, which is why I got it so cheap (he had an employee discount). I had my heart set on a SUV, but I fell in love with this car when I saw it sitting in the lot. 
Here are some reasons why I liked it:
It was white, sporty looking, and had a great electric sunroof that would either vent up or open all the way up, with just a touch of a button. It seemed to be power everything, power locks, power windows, power sunroof, even power seats. Also front wheel drive is better in the snow than rear wheel drive.
Here is my reality check:
I bought it and then I had my mechanic take a look at it after I drove it from IL to MA. He said that he wish that I had gotten his opinion first because this car is known to have some serious problems. For starters, almost all my brakes were gone, so I was lucky to have gotten back alive. I spent a fortune on brakes, but they still don't work right. I was told that it is because this car has special ABS brakes. On several occasions, when I was turning and stopping/ or slowing down, it would skid on me. When I tried to brake once, instead of coming to a complete stop, it skipped a few inches before stopping, which really scared me because I came an inch short of hitting the car in front of me. 
My mechanic can't figure out why my trunk randomly pops open, he's examined it, but he said it looks normal. If anyone else has this problem, please let me know what you did to solve it because it is really annoying to have it just pop open out of the blue.
Also, I have had my car taken in several times, and they have tried everything to prevent my car from randomly dying, but it will still do it on occasion without warning, and that is just plain dangerous. It went dead on me in the middle of a busy four way intersection, and I thought I was a goner. 
What really scared me was when some blue smoke came out of the steering wheel one day when I was just sitting at a red light. No one has yet to give me a good explanation why this happened. 
Also, the steering wheel has the radio on it, which seems like a nice luxury. My mechanic told me that if just one of the buttons shorts out, that everything will go, so I would have to replace the whole steering wheel, which costs over a grand. 
This car has been nothing but a nightmare and a headache, and I really wish someone had warned me about this. At first I thought this only happened to me, but a coworker said that he use to have one too, and the brakes were horrible, so he traded it in for another car. 
I can't wait to get rid of this car, because I feel like I'm driving the deathmobil.
If you're going to get a car, please do you research first. Don't buy on impulse, like the way I did, and learn your lesson the hard way. There are so many resources available out there, so make sure you know what you're buying so you won't have regrets.
