            I bought this car because i was in need of a cheap car to get me from a to b.  I was very young(17) and knew very little about cars and thought &quot;awww that neon sure is cute awwww&quot;.  Well i paid a lot in both stress and money for that cuteness.

This car has a couple good things.  (1) Its cute.  (2) Not A LOT of repairs, though there are problems, just not worth fixing.  And the things that i have fixed were A LOT of money and QUITE necessary.

Now the BAD....well first and fore most...OIL GASKET!!!  I had mine replaced twice...both under 52,000 miles!  The first was at 39,800.  The second at 51,300, ONLY 12,000 miles that's just unexceptable!!  The gasket problem is the last thing i will pay for on this car, because i've had it.  I'm VERY lucky that Don Miller, where i bought the car has been very good about it, and got me the part for free, but i still had to pay for towing and labor($150).  Yes i'm lucky the part was $800 and i've heard of many people who had to pay for themselves, so thank you Don Miller for that.  I replaced the horrible tires it came with.  I swear they'd go low just a couple days after i put air in them.  I replaced them first with the same make of tires that were already on it and they lost air even faster.  Than i got a cheaper Michelin x series tires, and though the Tires Plus shop i went to put it on wrong and it was flat a day later, it since has held air much better than the Good Years that it came with.  I replaced the brakes after a couple years of hearing them squeak(sometimes a very very loud squeak) and going to the shop and them telling me they are okay, and didn't need to be replaced.  2 out of 4 of the speakers(front right and back left) are blown out, and yes i've been known to turn some songs up really loud, but i've never had speakers blow like that.  The a/c went at about 40,000 miles, and they said it would run me about $500.  I don't have that much money just sitting around, so i have no air now.  The chipped paint is absolutely horrible!  Every time I open my trunk or hood i look at it and just think about how &quot;pretty&quot; my blue car will be in a couple years when it's a rust color.  There is also this &quot;plastic&quot; coating, or whatever you want to call it over the paint that is peeling off the bottom part of my car, and under that is a freightfull sight of what my car will look like very soon, and really how do you fix that.  I'm sure there is more, but i try to ignore it because i don't want to admit that i made a HUGE mistake with this car.  Overall this car has not held up as good as a car should with under 52,000 miles on it.

It's an okay drive.  Loud at times.  The wind comes through the windows because the &quot;unique&quot; design of no window frame on the door, only on the actual car.  Seats are quite comfortable, but than again i'm 5 feet tall and haven't had any problems with any other cars either.  No tilt steering really is not a good idea in this model.  Checking my blind spot is almost useless.  Even when i check it, i can't really see anything.  I tried to just ignore it, but when you almost side swipe a couple people even after you've checked you're blind spot, it gets harder and harder to ignore.

I would only recommend this car to someone who is planning on getting a new one in a couple years, even though the resale value is a joke.  Maybe a cheap lease too.  However someone who wants a dependable, long lasting car.....go get that else where, maybe Toyota or Honda(a little more, but much less hassle).<br><br>
