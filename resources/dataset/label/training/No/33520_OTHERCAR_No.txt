            This is a review of a 1996 Monte Carlo Z34, the Monte Carlo that is far more attractive than the all-new 2000 model.  However I came to find out during my marriage to the 96 Z34 that beauty needs to run more than just skin deep.

At first glance the 96 Z34 is an attractive car.  Come to think of it, at second, third, and even many more glances this car is attractive.  Nice basic shape and with tinted windows it looks killer.  I never did but I'd suggest dropping it ever so slightly.  Just an inch or two.  But anyway, more about the car.

The Z34 is pretty quick car, especially considering its sizeable weight (3400 pounds, give or take).  If only it had a manual it would be far quicker.  The 3.4L engine (later replaced by the 3.8L) as fitted in the 96 is a delight.  It's horribly raucous with a wonderful exhaust note and neck-snapping acceleration.  One of my most favorite &quot;features&quot; was the slight delay when you floored the car at about 20 mph.  The car hesitates for a split second while the tranny (a 4-speed auto) makes sure you really want to unleash the fury contained therein.  After this slight pause the engine explodes (figuratively speaking of course) into a symphony of combustion that emanates from under the hood as the front tires claw for traction.  When you finally regain your senses you'll realize you're doing well over the speed limit.

Inside the car is well-thought out, although  the gearlever might be a skosh too big.  The radio is right at hand, not that you'll need it if you have the optional steering wheel controls (they are a godsend, I must admit).  The back seat is quite large for a two-door, although entry/exit is a bit difficult.  The seats themselves (the fronts at least) aren't too comfortable, especially on a road trip.  The ride isn't choppy and instead is rather smooth, considering the Z34's sports car aspirations.  The trunk is huge (4 golf bags huge) and the sound system excellent.  Even has good gas mileage, assuming you go lightly on the pedal on the right.

However there is a darker side of the Z34, one that I am reluctant to speak of.  First off, if you're a true auto enthusiast then look elsewhere.  The Z34 has neither the power (I know up there I said all that stuff but in reality the Z34 isn't overly fast compared to other cars--it just feels like it) nor the agility (it is a pretty hefty car, after all) to run with smaller imports like the 3-series BMW, Preludes, and even modified Integras.  Every once in a while I'd catch a Mustang GT off-guard, though.  Without a stick shift or rear-drive (one, the other, or both) the Z34 will never much more than a hotted up grocery getter and boulevard cruiser.

Worse yet is the Z34's spotty reliability.  In a mere four years my Z34 would have racked up well over $2,000 in repairs alone were it not for warranties of some type or another (there's the standard 3/36,000 warranty and an extended 6/60,000 as on mine but it doesn't cover everything past 3/36,000.).  Every other week it seemed some problem or another had surfaced or the &quot;service engine soon&quot; light would go on for no apparent reason but to annoy me to no end.  Alternators, electronics, brakes, timing belts, and blown gaskets were but a few of the reasons my Z34 became a regular at the local Chevy dealer's Service Area.  Granted, some of the trouble my be attributed to my driving style (let's just say the car spends more time above 4,000 rpm than it does below) but on a car with a mere 35,000 miles on it in 4 years I think this is a tad excessive.  I might as well make a standing appointment every Monday morning at the shop.

In conclusion the 96 Monte Carlo Z34 should, unfortunately, be avoided.  Yes it may be my fault that the car got FUBAR but I wouldn't put it past GM to have messed up in the first place (not that I don't like GM; we have 6 of the general's cars), what with their not-too-esteemed track record.  If you are willing to take that chance however you will be happy, assuming the thing never rears its head and bites you.<br><br>
