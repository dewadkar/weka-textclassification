            I was looking for a SUV that was reliable, so I went to Honda.  Well, they may make great small cars but you're better off buying domestically (in the US) for the bigger vehicles.  While I enjoyed the overall drive, several things went wrong with it within the first 3 or 4 months I owned it.  From the torque converter (eventually requiring them to completely replace the transmission) to the rear differential to the brakes, they had my SUV in the shop for at least a month of the 6 months I 
owned it.  I had a friend who bought the same SUV from Isuzu (the Rodeo) and had her A/C break within the first week.  The dealerships didn't handle my dissatisfaction well at all, and the customer service 1-800 number gave me a song and dance about how basically sometimes,  &quot;stuff&quot; happens.  I was understandably pretty disappointed by my entire Honda experience.
It's not acceptable for them to not have the parts available to replace something broken, either -- after claiming they'd have to get the torque converter shipped in from Japan (following several fruitless days of searching for it in the United States), they replaced the entire transmission because for some reason that fell through as well.  I am now the proud owner of a Ford
