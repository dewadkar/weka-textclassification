            I bought a '93 Grand Am GT used with 97,000 miles on it. I bought it because my geeky little Escort got smashed and I wanted a nicer looking car...well better looks is about all I got along with numerous repair bills, a noisier ride, and more cash paid out every month.
I didn't even get the car for 2 months after purchase because it had to go back to the dealer to have the computer, all the sensors, switches and nobs replaced. Then the real fun began...the exhaust had to be replaced, which I could deal with since that's a major problem you face with some used cars.....except the dealer had already replaced the muffler once, I am now on my second after-market and it whistles when I accelerate. The dealer also had to replace several sensors twice, the shocks and struts once (I have been in need of another set for two months---as the car sits in my driveway), and the fog lamps twice.
I was fortunate enough to shell out extra cash for an extended warranty, however, that did not cover the wheel bearings it chewed through, or the tires it ate in under 6 months because the struts went bad again.
My carpet is ruined because when it rains I can keep goldfish on my front floor...measured it once and it was 1/2 an inch deep..the car then starts to smell musty and awful when the warm weather arrives.The trunk leaks too although not as bad.
My air conditioning nobs have broken 4 times, and the car is covered in tiny dings and dents....which it dents far too easily in my opinion. I will also say my bare version Escort Pony rattled and squeaked FAR less than this car does. Not matter how often you tighten the dash it squeaks and rattles within a week. 
The car handles awful in the snow and sucks down a ton of gas (I have had to have the throttle plate cleaned 4 times and have owned it under a year--I put Mobile 97 in it so it is not the quality of gas). Also the gauges (gas, temp, etc...)worked for about two weeks then died in it.
To top it all off, the transmission is letting go....have absolutely no passing gear....which presents a problem when the majority of my driving is done on the highway.
I will never buy another Grand Am and will probably avoid Pontiac all together for any future car purchases.
