            After my bad experience with my 1982 Chevy Cavalier, I swore that I would never own another GM product as long as I had breath in my body.  But after a decade and a half to mellow the bitter taste, I decided to give GM another chance.  But I never thought it would be their last one. Little has changed with GM quality since 1982.

My wife and I own a pair of these, both bought in mid 1997, so this is not just a case of &quot;you got a lemon&quot;.  No, we got a pair of lemons.  What do you suppose the probability of that is? The mechanical problems on both cars have been similar, but not identical.  While it is comfortable, quiet, and pleasing to the eye, this bucket of bolts has been a mechanics dream and an owners nightmare.  

Problems have included defective lower control arm bushings, oil leaks, engine cooling system leaks, failures to start (or keep running when started), break problems (including premature wear), burning odors (turned out to be defective break linings), cloth trim falling off door panels, a broken switch on the emergency break lever, and poorly fitting glove boxes. The glove box problem was particularly annoying, because when the light stayed on the battery wouldn't crank the engine. Thank God for AAA.  

These problems persisted right through the whole 36,000 mile warranty period and continues to today. As I write this review, I only have 45,000 miles on this car and last week the air conditioner started blowing fuses.  Haven't got that one fixed yet.....

If you must have a Malibu, be prepared for the quiet, comfortable, and &quot;frequent&quot; rides to your dealer!

And by all means, if you live in North Carolina don't buy from Hendrick Chevrolet. I believe their mechanics are not technically proficient.  And the dealership boasts of a falsely inflated customer satisfaction record.
As proof, I offer the fact that every time my car or my wife's was serviced we got a follow-up phone call from the dealer inquiring about our satisfaction. Since I withheld any negative comment, the call was always followed a few days later by a written survey from GM.  Following my last service visit, I received the usual call, but this time unloaded on them about their mechanics poor performance, repeat repairs, and lack of quality control.  I requested a call from the General Manager.  Even after repeated calls to the dealer, I never received that promised follow-up call from the General Manager. And I never got that survey from GM either.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.  Customer sat is just a game, and the dealer knows how to make themselves look good.<br><br>
