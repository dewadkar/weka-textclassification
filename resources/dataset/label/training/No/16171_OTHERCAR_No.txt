            I have over 4000 shots on a Fuji 4700 Zoom the Big Little brother to the MX-2900. I have a good understanding of it's capabilities and had certain expectations, some high, some not..

I learned the settings, switches etc based on knowledge of the 4700 though was disappointed by several things.
1. Image quality is lack luster at best.
2. Very hungry for power.
3. Very slow to start up, cycle, save, and display shots than 4700.
4. No Video capture option.
5. Somewhat awkward to hold. 
6. Lens cover is not effective. Difficult to fit.
7. Macro setting does little.
8. Flash underpowered - definitely need to use the external adapter for extra lighting (good that it has it I guess - though shame it needs it)
9. Considering it's size and weight (AND PRICE) I was expecting it to be capable of doing something better than the tiny 4700 zoom (see epinions of 4700 zoom - the Mouse that roars)

I donï¿½t know if I was spoiled with the other camera but I was disappointed when I was given the 2900. I believe I gave it an honest opportunity to prove itself. It gave little in return. Keep shopping and be sure to check out the 4700 zoom
