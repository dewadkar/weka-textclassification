               Yes a van of anytype is nice if you have a larger family, do daycare, or just like to take friends out, but there is a risk on the caravans that i don't know if many people know about, i do believe it is the 94 model, and it didn't happen only once but three times just around where i live, but i know one family it personally happened to, what happen you ask?  Well there is a leak from a line that drips directly onto the altenator that sparks, thank god our friend needed to use a rest area, to her suprize when she came out her van was burning to the ground, the fire is so intence and so hot it melts everything including the engine, there was nothing recognizable it was totally gone.  Another couple that was a big part of the community wasn't so lucky they haven't pin pointed that this was what happened but i do believe it was they had the same make model and year van they had but theirs caught fire on the freeway and well they didn't survive, so just make sure when you are shopping for a van you do take the time to check everything, not just the color, and how many it fits, I was told it was only this year and the newer ones are safe, but still, check it out before you buy, for your protection and your families.<br><br>
