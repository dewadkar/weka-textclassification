            This camera works well as a simple point and shoot camera. It has a decent quality zoom lens, a good flash, and an easy to use menu system. The LCD display is good and the extra Energizer 2100 mAh NiMh batteries I bought last forever in this camera.

That was the good.  Now the bad.

Outdoor daytime pictures are excellent (as they are with any camera).  Indoor pictures are reasonable as long as there is enough light to focus.  In a dimly lit room, the camera can't focus at all.  This can be a problem for birthdays and other indoor occasions (family gatherings, parties, kids etc).

Close up macro pictures are good but, as with any other camera, you must use a tripod.  Any little movement will cause the subject to be out of focus.

The biggest problem I have with this camera is with the advanced features.  If you turn the mode wheel to switch between modes (ex switch from "Auto" to "Portrait"), the camera literally shuts off and back on.  This is very slow and annoying.

The lack of a manual focus is very limiting for certain shots (like taking a picture of a zoo animal through a fence; the camera focuses on the fence, not the animal). Also the sunlight and shadows completely confused the camera.  Many pictures were badly overexposed or underexposed.

There is no manual setting, only PAS (Program, Aperture Pri and Shutter Pri).  Again, this is very limiting in many situations.  I'm not an expert, but even I wanted this capability at times.

The preset white balance settings are good when the subject is well lit but useless indoors.  For indoor pictures, you must always use the flash. Even then, a lot of indoor pictures come out dark.  A custom/manual white balance setting would do wonders for indoor natural lighting pictures.

This is my first digital camera.  I understand that the Kodak 6340 is not a prosumer model, but more of a point and shoot model.  But the limitations mentioned above quickly become a problem for any beginner.  You're not going to take simple group pictures all your life.

In comparison, the Canon A70 is a much better buy because it has most of the missing features mentioned above.  I didn't buy the Canon A70 because every store in the Washington DC area was sold out.  Many places told me there would be a two to three week waiting period.  I should have waited.
