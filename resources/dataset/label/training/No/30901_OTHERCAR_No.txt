            A 1992 model Hyundai Excel 2 door hatch back was my first car. I bought it as a one-year used car at $7,500. As a college student, I was just happy to have my own car, cheap but you can go anyway.

       	Later on I realized that I could have put my money in better use than buying this one. I had two major problems and a handful minor ones during my four-year ownership with it, and none of these problems were due to my poor maintenance of the car or bad driving. The second major problem killed the car. I sold the un-repaired car to a car shop for $700.

        	The first major problem happened only a year after I bought the car. Luckily, it was till under manufactory warranty. I am not a car expert, so all I can tell you were it was something wrong with the cylinder. Apparently, a seal or something related to the entrance of one of the four cylinders was broken suddenly while I was driving on highway, and the car just lost power in a matter of seconds. Imagine my scary and nervous at the time. 

        	After the problem got fixed (which if it's not under warranty, would cost me around $1,500 to fix it), a few minor problems happened. One was to the brake that I had to replace for $120, and one sudden crack of windshield out of nowhere cost me another $120 or so, and other little things happened here and there.

        	Then came the last hit. Somehow one day on my way back from school, the radiator of the car broken, and it broken so bad that the transmission system was ruined too (I only found out that later at the repair shop, don't ask me why or how). I was looking at a repair bill of more than $2000. This was simply too much for me. So I sold it as un-repaired. 
       
       	 I have tried to think why my car had so many problems. I changed the oil of the car every three months; I did my three-year $36000 check up as suggested. The car was able to pass emission test and inspection every year until problems happened suddenly every time. I bought the car at 12,000 mileage, and when I sold it, it only has 53,000 on it. So you can tell I didn't overuse it during the four years.

       	Well, I drew my conclusion when I heard my brother's story about his Hyundai. He bought a used one to at 50,000 mileage at about $3000, and it broke down less than a year since he bought it. The repair bill again was too high and he basically abandoned the car by donating it to charity as it was. So my conclusion is, don't waste money on a Hyundai, especially a used one that has no warranty.
