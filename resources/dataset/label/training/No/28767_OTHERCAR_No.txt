            The best thing about my Moms '90 Continental was the ride. Otherwise it is nothing more than an oversized Taurus, with all the Taurus problems plus Lincoln problems.. Before she totaled it with 64,000 miles last year..

We replaced both rear air struts (air bladders rotted out) $400 for each unit plus labor.
starter
alternator
rebuilt stero control head
auto locking truck mechanism made out of cheap plastic that snapped apart.
front door window mounting brackets seperated from glass. Only fix was to replace glass which comes with new clips.
Climate Control A/C crapped out
tie rods, ball joints
famous 3.8 v6 head gaskets failed
transmission rebuilt
Digital Dash replaced
Windshield wiper motor failed.
&quot;DLC&quot; error flashing on dash readout... never fixed that one..

Run away as fast as you can next time you see one of these with a for sale sign on the window.. really... run quickly!
