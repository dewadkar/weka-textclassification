            We purchased a 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport with a 3.3L V-6 engine in 1997. This was our first minivan and our first Dodge product. During the first two years after purchasing this van, we had no problems and we were thrilled with the way it drove and looked. Let me just say this in the beginning: We take great care of this van and have it serviced every 3,000 miles. The van is a 1997 and it has only 32,000 miles on it!  

Earlier this year, however, we noticed a problem with the transmission while braking. The transmission will &quot;jump&quot; when coming to a stop, as if it is downshifting too late. We were not overly concerned at first, but we talked to MANY other Caravan owners who also have experienced this problem and it eventually led to them having to replace the transmission. We were furious that this could be happening to a van that was not even 3 years old with 26,000 miles on it at the time. We took it in to the dealership right away because our warranty was up in 6 months. They &quot;overhauled&quot; our transmission free of charge and assured us the problem was fixed. We got the van back and the problem was still very evident, so we took the van back to the dealer and this time they &quot;reprogrammed&quot; the transmission, saying that it was something to do with the computer chip inside. We again drove the van home and the problem was still very evident! 

We have a 1 year extended warranty left on the transmission due to the work we have had done recently, but that is not enough in our opinion. Our van will have around 40,000 miles on it after that year and they are saying that we would be responsible for paying for a new transmission if it went out at that point, which it is likely to do, considering it has happened to everyone else who has experienced this problem we have talked to. We are currently fighting Dodge to have a brand new transmission put in and we are having it checked by numerous other mechanics as well. We are also fighting with Dodge to get an extended(more than 1 year) warranty on the new transmission if it is put in. Be careful if you own this van. You may very well have a transmission problem that is obviously a manufacturer defect.<br><br>
