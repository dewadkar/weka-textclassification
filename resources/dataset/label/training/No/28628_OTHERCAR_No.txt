            Just an update at the 140,000km mark... the truck runs terrible - like usual.  The V6 has a very rough idle and the catalytic converter was recently replaced for the sixth or seventh time... front brake rotors are starting to warp again... on schedule at least (every 25,000 kms).  The paint is fading and scratches are all over the place - this truck has to have the weakest paint I have ever seen.  
The interior is looking pretty worn, the centre console lid is somewhat broken.  The seat fabric, however, is holding up pretty well.  
The truck is definitely showing its age... but it has never performed like a new truck... with all the problems and visits to the shop.  It just feels like it is barely holding together because once the motor and transmission have been toyed with so much by the dealer techs, it is just never the same.  The truck still violently clunks into reverse when it's cold... but the problem isn't apparent when the vehicle is warmed up.
My dad is extremely unhappy with this truck and will not buy another Chrysler because of it... however he is stuck with it for a couple more years because he wouldn't get anything for it right now and would lose too much if he were to buy something new.
My advice to anyone out there is to avoid any Chrysler product... they may look nice... but what good is a nice looking car if it spends most of the time in the shop?  I'm not joking.  Do yourself a favour and buy a nice European or Japanese car.  They know how to build a quality automobile... who cares if they're a bit bland - they work!!!<br><br>
