            I purchased my 1995 Isuzu Rodeo used, it had 68,000 miles on it.  By the time I had purchased it it had already had the following things replaced: Clutch, u-joint, tires, battery, and that is all i know about I understand the tires, but the rest of the items should have lasted longer than that.

Since the purchase I have replaced the following things: water pump, both head lights (they both blew at the same time), I have replaced the alternator twice in one year.  And it still doesn't run very well.  Has lots of electrical problems.  I have also replaced the brakes including the front rotors.

Now for the vehicle its self.  The back seats are uncomfortable to sit in.  No cup holders in the vehicle at all.  

There are positives as well:  This vehicle has some balls, I can race all my friends and their cars, and completely waste them.  Tons of storage space, back seats fold down and you can sleep in the back.  Well most people can, I can't because I am 6'4 so it is not the most comfortable.

As you can probably tell from my opinion and the opinions of others here, this car sucks, don't buy it if you see one for sale, when the changed the rodeo for the 1995.5 edition, they fixed most of the problems so stick to a newer one.

UPDATE:  Now I am replacing the Starter, and rewiring the licence plate light.  Then I am going to try and get ride of it.  It is now at 79,300 miles
