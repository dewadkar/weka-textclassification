            I bought a 1997 Dodge Intrepid ES new from the dealer.  I was trouble from the word go.

The steering was off (both alignment and the actual wheel) and repeated attempts to fix it were unsuccessful.  After four attempts, I filed for arbitration to have the car declared a &quot;lemon&quot; under the law.  Unfortunately, consumer protection laws are not very strong in my state (Missouri) and I was stuck.

The side moldings along the back window running to the roof were put on too tightly at the factory, requiring them to be replaced by the dealer.

Brakes needed replacement after normal driving conditions at 25,000 miles.

The back seat not folding down makes large objects difficult to transport.

The optional 3.5 engine requires mid grade gas, which gets expensive at times like these.

The 1997 Intrepid was subject of two factory recalls.

Some reputable auto raters say the Intrepid was redesigned and improved in 1998, a fact I cannot verify as I will never own one again.

The ride is smooth enough and the temperature control thermostat is a wonderful option for any car.

The interior is big enough for four to travel comfortably, although the non-powered passenger seat gets crampy on long rides.<br><br>
