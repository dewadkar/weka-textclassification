            My husband and I bought this car because we thought it would be better on gas mileage than the 97 Ford Explorer that we owned. We also wanted a cheaper car payment. So, we found the Malibu. 
Last night at about 9:00 p.m., my husband, my kids, and myself were driving home from a vacation 6 hours from home. So, about 45 minutes from home, the power steering pump exploded! We were stuck on the interstate in zero degree weather. Let me mention that we still have dealer plates on this car. We have only had it for about 3 weeks now. In the past couple of weeks we have also notice a shimmy while we are driving. I don't know if it's related to what happened last night or if it's another problem. A vehicle that is this new should not have problems like this. So much for saving money by getting rid of our Explorer. 
I would also like to mention the lights. I like to be in control of when I use my light and when I don't. The lights come on automatically when you start the car. It's especially bad at night because if I start the car to let it warm up, the lights shine directly on my neighbors window. I'm sure they must think I'm being rude, but there is no way to turn the lights off. You can't even use parking lamps.
The cruise control is another problem that I would like to mention. If you have the cruise set and lightly tap the brakes, it will slow down and then take back off again. I don't see how that is very safe. In my previous vehicles, hitting the brakes even slightly turned off the cruise. Also, when you want to set the cruise, it is very touchy. It's almost just easier to not use the cruise at all.
I was dissapointed that this car doesn't have automatic locking belts on the shoulder belts in the back seat for a child seat. So, everytime we take the kids seats in and out, we have to use a locking clip.   
I guess there must be a brighter side to everything. The few nice things about this car are comfortable front seats and lots of storage space. Our LS model has a very nice CD player. 
I don't think anyone should buy this car. I wish I would have researched it more before we bought ours.
