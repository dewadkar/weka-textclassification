            The 2001 Buick Park Avenue has not had any major changes in two years now.  It is still available in the Basic and Ultra models.  This is a large sedan that sits near the top of the hill of American Luxury cars and is a good bargain for its price.  For a little more, one can get a Cadillac Seville which will also have better performance and the new &quot;night vision&quot; feature from general motors. If you do not mind foreign automobiles, there are a couple on the market in America which for the same price will out comfort and out perform the Park Avenue.  

When driving the Park Ave, the size of the car is definitely noticeable.  It feels like a large sedan and moves like one too.  The interior is spacious and all controls are with in a good reach of the driver, or maybe captain of this vessel.  The instrumentation is very easy to read and the controls do seem to be in a logical order.  This car does tend to have excessive lean when cornering and does lack a little bit of pep, especially in the 20-35 mph range.  

The model in general does lack consistency in build quality.  At my dealership, I sit in almost every car and some of the Park Avenues the seats are very comfortable while others the seats feel like the 15 year old sofa in my living room covered with a sheet.<br><br>
