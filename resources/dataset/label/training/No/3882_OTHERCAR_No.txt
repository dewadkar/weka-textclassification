            In May 1999 when we found out we were expecting our third child (planned), we decided to purchase a minivan.  We wanted the Honda Odyssey but unfortunately, we already had a car payment on our Honda Civic so we could not afford that van.  My husband saw an ad in the paper for a Plymouth Voyager for $12,000 and change (don't remember exact price).  He decided to go look at the dealer since it was near his job.  He put a down payment on it and we ended up taking delivery on it a few days later since we had a few extras put on like a roof rack, CD player and tint.  Besides for poor dealer service with a few things, the transaction was very smooth and I was impressed.  

We took the car home and shortly after the window (we did not have power) crank started to make a funny noise and it was difficult to roll down.  We never had time to get back to the dealer (45 minutes away) cause they needed 3 weeks notice to make an appointment and we dont have a schedule that far in advance.  My husband has off from work one day a week and it makes it difficult to schedule to drop off the car for the day.  And I can't go without a car during the week, with 3 children.  Now, every time we get out of the car, we get a shock.  We called the dealer and they said nothing is wrong, but every time we touch the car door or our eg brushes it, we get shocked.

My parents had a 1993 Plymouth Voyager and the transmission went after 2 years.  I am really nervous about keeping this car much longer, so as soon as my Honda is paid off...we will be trading it in!<br><br>
