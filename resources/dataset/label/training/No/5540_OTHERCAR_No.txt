            There has not been a Chevrolet product in our family for 20 years, after an experience with a lemon '77 3/4 ton pickup. I liked the looks of this Tahoe, and after a test drive I had to have one. Bought this truck mainly for its size, you can pile the kids and all your gear in and still be comfortable. Things that impressed me initially were the plushness of the interior, the excellent visibility, and the smooth car like ride. There are interior lights everywhere, and the factory sound system and CD player are more than adequate.

The plushness of the ride does come at a cost, the truck leans and feels heavy when cornering. 

The Vortec engine pulls this 5500 lb+ truck along well. The transmission shift logic is set to keep engine rpm low, which makes the truck seem sluggish with a light press on the gas pedal. Push further down though and you will be impressed with the aggressive acceleration. 

Problems so far include bad brakes that shake the steering wheel and dash whenever you use them. This showed up by 10000 miles and the dealer refused to warrant them even with the pads still at 70%. I have owned a $200  used Datsun that had better brakes than this truck. There are some noises also that showed up early, also unrepaired by the dealer but explained as a noisy body mount. 

 The dealer was able to repair the steering sensor that had failed, which was causing the truck to turn off the road or into the oncoming lane. That was explained as an oversteer that the dealer had seen in other trucks. This sensor was replaced at approximately 30000 miles, and it failed again by 60000 miles. Apparently there is a Service Bulletin out on the defective sensors, but no recall on them. Of course the second failure occurred after it was out of warranty. The dealer did not buy my argument that they have not fixed the original problem of defective steering sensors, so I had to purchase the second one. 

 Bad brakes and steering are one thing, but at least the truck still worked. The big surprise was when the truck quit altogether and required a tow to the nearest Goodwrench. It turned out the fuel pump had worn out. The engine ran perfectly till the day it stalled on the road and would not restart.  The dealer diagnosed this over the phone as they claimed there is almost a 100% failure rate of these pumps between 50 and 70 thousand miles in our area due to our gas (ie. blame it on the oil companies). Of course Chevrolet doesn't make this throw away item easy to replace, it is installed inside the fuel tank and only replaceable as a "module". The tab on the fuel pump job was just over $900 (Canadian), which included a modest tow bill of $85 as luckily we were near town when it stalled. 

 Expect these expensive repairs before the the normal wear items, first set of tires, fan belt or spark plugs are worn out. 

 Truck has just over 60000 miles on it, and I now regret that I did not purchase an extended warranty. The transmission has now started to shift harshly if you drive for more than half an hour. The first time it happened I thought we were rear-ended it hit so hard. We will only take short trips in town with this truck till I can afford to take this to a transmission shop in a couple of months. 2 more monthly payments of $682 and the truck will be paid off. 

 I tried trading the truck off on a newer model Tahoe this past summer, but declined to do so as I was only offered $17000 CAN$, against a new one that was well over $50000 (we pay 17% tax here in the West Coast of Canada). My cost on this 97 with taxes and financing was $57000, so I figure I depreciated about $40000 in less than 6 years.  Unless you are a business and can write off this depreciation, I don't think this is an affordable vehicle.

 In summary, I would never buy one of these new again. These trucks have depreciated so much, they are probably not a bad truck to buy used if you are your own mechanic , or have lots of money to spend on repairs.
