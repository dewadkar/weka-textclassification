            In my native Canada, Volkswagen was practically extinct thanks to the Audi 5000 debacle many years ago and the rust-prone Rabbits and Golfs which followed,letting the Japanese sedans take the lead from the long established Germans. But German automotive heritage has something still going for it. While French and British cars are mostly gone from these shores, VW continues to hold a slice of the market with one part nostalgia (New Beetle) and one part repositioning as the less expensive German alternative to BMW and Audi.

<b>The Passat</b>
VW's flagship is available as either a sedan or station wagon. I drove a white Passat GLS sedan for a month while housesitting for a friend.

<b>walkaround</b>
Since most 4-door sedans are pretty bland, it's always a pleasure to look at the almost avant garde lines of the Passat. Not as wild as the Audi A4 (with which it shares its basic platform), the Passat is a trim, smart looking sedan that isn't going to be mistaken for a Camry or a Taurus.

<b>Handling</b>
This is a German car! The car feels rock solid and the handling is tight and perfectly balanced - especially well-engineered for a front wheel drive car. Steering is almost neutral and the car handles corners fast and with minimal squeal. The 5-speed was smooth and easy to shift although the clutch pedal was just a bit too light with quite a bit of travel.

<b>Space</b>
This is a large, spacious sedan ideal for 4-5 passengers although the really tall should sit in front because of the angle of the rear window. Spacious trunk is nicely trimmed with carpeting. It may be a German car but North American niceties like cup holders are provided - even though they make shifting a bit awkward.

<b>Reliability</b>
While you might think you're driving an Audi or BMW (you do get more car for the money than an Audi or BMW 3-series), my Passat had numerous electronic gremlins:

1. Seat belt on passenger side jammed!
2. Power windows/locks failed with a 4 month wait for parts.
3. Stereo failed and was replaced twice - VW dealer thought that the built-in theft-proof system was the culprit.

<b>Overall</b>
The Passat is a great car to drive. The problems the car had were addressed by the dealer quickly but the missing parts turned into a nightmare. Without the components for the power locks, for example, we couldn't take the car anywhere since we couldn't lock the doors. With a broken passenger side seat belt, that meant that passengers sat in the back seat until the front seat became "legal" again.
