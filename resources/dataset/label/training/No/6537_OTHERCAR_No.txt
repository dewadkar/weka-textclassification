            We bought this mini-van after driving all the competition.  There is little doubt that this van offers the best ride - just like a car.  However, that is where the good things stop, and the maintenance headaches begin...
&quot;Several times in the shop per year&quot; doesn't even come close.  We would save money if we moved closer to the shop.  Or perhaps I should work there, and the mechanics can just tow the car daily from the parking lot!
The first thing to go wrong, two months after purchase, was the transmission - total failure, had to replace the entire lower block.  This is the same complaint I've seen and heard from many other owners - I'm surprised a class-action lawsuit isn't pending.  With the replacement transmission, the car often will not go into gear after moving the lever from Park to Drive, until several anxious seconds have passed.  Then, when coming to a stop, the transmission will occasionally 'grab' and accelerate the car, before disengaging.  Not the excitement I need in my life...
From then on, it was a constant stream of replacements:
- Radio - completely dead
- Rear speaker squealed horribly and died
- both back seats developed an irritating 'click' in the seat back
- one arm fell off one back bucket seat
- wipers came on by themselves (rear and front), still happens after replacement
- battery completely dead due to electrical short
- serpentine belt failed after rubbing and nearly causing engine fire
- loose sliding door panels
- air conditioning cuts out after an hour of use - deemed &quot;unfixable&quot;
- I'm sure there are more that I've just blocked out for my own sanity

Overall, anything mechanical on this car has failed or, I suspect, will fail.  The one bright spot is I've honed my debating skills at the dealership - After the transmission replacement, I got them to give me a free 7 year 70,000 bumper to bumper warrantee (which does not cover batteries killed by the electrical system, by the way - I guess that's above the bracket formed by the two bumpers).  I know they did it just to get me out of the dealership so they could go home - and I'm extremely proud of myself for getting that ounce of flesh.

To sum up, I really wish some Japanese auto company would do what Dodge advertises they are doing - COPY THE BODY OF THIS MINI-VAN, and make everything else Japanese, and thus dependable.  PLEASE!!!  Chrysler/Dodge either does not know how to build cars, or they make so much money on planned obsolecense they'd be silly to fix problems.<br><br>
