            I received the CASIO QV~120 DIGITAL CAMERA, as a gift in October 1999.  I was quite excited since I had been wanting a digital camera for quite some time.  I tend to think I am pretty high~tech and can figure many electronic devices out without much trouble.  This camera was pretty easy to maneuver.

The software was a cinch to install.  I was warned before I used the camera that it would cost a fortune to keep it in picture taking capability.  I honestly took it with a grain of salt.  I was totally shocked when after taking just 24 pictures in about 10 minutes that the batter light started flashing.  I thought to myself this has got to be a mistake.  Unfortunately it wasn't a mistake at all.  I didn't even get to upload the pictures to my computer so I could edit and save them before the batteries conked out on me.  At this point I had the regular Duracell AA batteries installed, then I decided to switch to the new Duracell-High Tech Batteries.  The new batteries are designed to be for high-tech draining devices, such as digital cameras, cell phones, and portable music players.  I am sorry to inform you, but the same problem occurred with these batteries.  You can only take approximately 24 pictures before your batteries will die on you.  If you upload pictures before you take 24 pictures then the batteries will conk out before the 24 pictures.  It just varies how many pictures you take then upload.

The quality of the pictures could be a lot better in my opinion.  I have to edit the color on all the pictures that I take.  The camera DOES NOT HAVE a BUILT IN FLASH!  To me this should be a must on any camera manufactured.  The camera also doesn't have a zoom function.  It does have a 10 second timer that I absolutely love.  It also has a function where you can protect a picture if you chooses to delete certain pictures after you have uploaded them, etc...

This camera is quite simple to use, but lacks major necessary features in my opinion.  If you are traveling and want to take this camera along for some pictures, you can't forget to take your software, your laptop, and plenty of batteries.  You can preview your pictures in the display area, but bewarned it looks totally different on your computer than it does on its screen.  At first I did have some problems getting the pictures to save correctly.  It does take quite some time to get the perfect picture that you thought you had taken to actually look halfway decent.

If you had better options than this camera, I would suggest any from the SONY MAVICA line.  I would definitely shop around before you make a purchase like this one.  Make sure the camera you want has all the features you are looking for.  Also anticipate any features you might need in the future.

Good luck with your digital camera picture taking. <br><br>
