            About 3 yeasr ago I bought a 1984 Mercury Topaz. I bought this car because it was all I could afford at the time. I bought it for a whopping total of $500.  Sice then I have put about $3000 into repairing the piece of crap. I went into sears to get the tires aligned, and they told me that they couldn't because the tierods were too lose, and to fix it would be $400. So I just decided to rotate the tires instead. During this process I managed to break off a wheel bolt, thats another $50 to fix. It shifts into 3rd gear (its last gear) at 22mph and is rough as hell. It leaks oil, smell, and somehow has bad gas milage?? To wrap this up I would like to suggest not buying a topaz...EVER   <br><br>
