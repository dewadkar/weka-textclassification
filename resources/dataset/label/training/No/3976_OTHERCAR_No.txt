            We are both pushing 40 years old, and this was our first new car. We looked at several different cars and finally decided to get this car due to discount ($750), financing (2.9%/4years), and the fact that we liked the car when we test drove it and what we found out after doing much research on the web. I didn't want any of the add-ons, so we got as base a vehicle as possible. We even deleted the floor mats!

Anyhow, after the bloom went off the rose, we started to notice several discrepencies with the car. The carpet had stains in it, loose plastic bits in the interior, dome light that kept dropping from the ceiling, body panel/door alignment that was way off, loud exhaust, chattering wipers, hard to grip door locks, weak air conditioner, mileage not what I expected, poorly calibrated oil change light, rattling glovebox door.

The good thing is that the dealer has taken care of most of the problems. The exhaust can't be fixed as it is a design problem. Manual transmission cars use a different exhaust manifold than the automatics, and are much louder than the automatic that I test drove. The body panels are as good as they can get them. Still not quite right, and took them 3 attempts to get to the point they are at now. Air conditioner is weak in my opinion, I think it probably works ok, but is just not as effective as the one in my '94 Voyager with 120k miles on it.

Good things.. The handling is great. 5 speed shifts are wonderful. Stock speakers are great(replaced stock radio with indash MP3 player). Easy to keep clean. Trunk is huge. Great performance from 4 cylinder engine. Good dealer experience.

Bad things.. Build quality. Car initially looked like it was put together during coffee break. Noisy at 2500 rpm.

So So things.. Firestone tires are marginal. I'll keep them till 50k miles or so, and then replace with something much better. Air conditioner week. Gas mileage not as good as I expected. I average 27mpg in mixed driving.

All in all, not bad for what we spent. I would have hated to have spent $20k for the same car with options/V6 and have those build problems. The good thing is that the dealer has been good about fixing it, even if it takes several times for them to get it right. Car has 5400 miles on it now.

Just to add. I just got done doing my first long trip with the car. 1000 miles of I-80 at 70-75 mph. Worst mileage I got was 31, best was 34.9. Averaged 32.9 mpg for the entire trip. Very good I think. I'll be using Mobil 1 synthetic next oil change, so I don't know if the mileage will improve any.

45000 mile update..

Warranty expired at 36000 miles. the following is a smattering of problems before that time.

Had 2 power steering pumps and 1 rack replaced. (I think rack is starting to go bad again now)
Clutch slave cylinder, and 5th gear in manual transmission replaced. Rear shim kit installed due to constant alignment problem. New set of tires installed by Saturn at 20000 due to premature wear.
