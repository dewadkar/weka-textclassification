            I read a previous review about problems with the 1994 LHS Chryslers and I've also had my share of problems. I purchased the vehicle used at about 45,000 miles. At 50,000 miles, the dash instrumentation went out, turns out that some sort of computerized chip in the console had to be replaced to the tune of $500.00. At 60,000 miles, the water pump went out and the left tie rods had to be replaced .... another $1200.00. Now the car is at around 70,000 miles, and the right tie rods will need to be replaced. I have drove many vehicles to past 100,000 with never a major repair. This is the first vehicle that I've had to sink big money into. I wouldn't recommend this vehicle to anyone who hates frequent trips to the auto repair shops.
What I like about this car is that it has all the luxuries at an economical price. For the same price, I would get a stripped down, Foreign-made car. Basically, you have to consider, &quot;Do I want luxury or do I want reliability?&quot; because I've found you won't get both unless you pay a fortune.
