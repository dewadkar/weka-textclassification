            Before considering this camera, definitely consider what you need to use it for.

If you want something (anything) that will give you quick access to you digital pics, this will get the job done fairly painlessly.  But if you rely on higher-quality pictures or are unable to keep re-shooting the same photo until it's what you need... avoid it.  This is strictly something to easily and inexpensively bridge the gap between the act of snapping a photo and your PC.  

Also be aware that if you intend to take many pictures of people with the flash, this camera usually provides red-eye pictures (the flash is less than an inch from the lens, causing a flash-angle that practically ensures devil eyes in all your subjects).  Use your savings to buy PhotoShop.  

Also i should note that dust gets into area between the cover-glass and the lens itself.  When i first opened the package there was a fleck of dust on the back of the glass, causing a fuzzy shadow just off-center of all pictures (in bright light shots it causes an odd halo).  It's not that difficult to open and clean if you're handy with small tools and parts, but one really shouldn't have to clean out a lens every few weeks.  The body has never felt firm or solid; the seams of the plastic body creak and groan at under my fingers at the slightest pressure.  (This has been the case since day one, not due to my occasionally having to open it up and clean it.)

Battery life seems to be better than most digital cameras I've ever used.  Very good for that.  And it takes AA's, which of course are easy to get wherever you are.

Trying to download the drivers from their site is a nightmare.  

I still want to upgrade to something that at least has zoom, more user control, and a flash that isn't so close to the lens, but all in all it's worth it for my immediate needs.
