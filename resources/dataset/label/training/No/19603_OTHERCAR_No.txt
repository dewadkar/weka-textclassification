            I have had this car for a couple of years now.  I got it because it was a little used and cheaper than most other cars.

This car has given me nothing but problems.  I have had to replace the engine twice.  I had to replace the klutch once.  I had to replace the transmission three times.  With that, the drivers seat has broken, twice.  I replaced it once but can't afford to replace it again.

This car is very uncomfortable.  My son is over six feet tall and he has problems getting in and out of it.  I am not a small person and there are times when I can't get in or out of this car.

The paint chips off the bumper easily.  I thought that since the car plastic was molded in this color that the paint could not chip off.  I was wrong.  My all white car has black spots on the bumper where the paint chips off.

The only thing I do like about this car is that it looks good.  My son drove it for a while and all his friends thought he was cool.  Beyond that, I hate this car but I have put too much money into it to sell it and get a different one (plus I am still paying it off)<br><br>
