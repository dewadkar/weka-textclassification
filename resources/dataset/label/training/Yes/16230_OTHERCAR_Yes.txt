            This 1999 4 dr. Toyota Corolla was a vacation rental for an extended 3 week period in early January. There were four of us with two taking turns driving. This lil' car was wonderful in every respect! Control layout for lights, radio, and wipers are all familiar and well placed for both tall and short drivers.  Its gas mileage exceeded our expectations at 27-31 mpg of regular unleaded gas in, at times, heavy Los Angeles traffic. While not having adjustable lumbar support the seats were quite comfortable on the longer parts of our travels around Southern California and Nevada. Rear seating was quite comfortable as the front seats had a wide range of movement fore and aft and little obstruction underneath. 

The Corolla had good passing power too, given there were four of us and 4 large Samsonite luggage pieces expertly packed into its roomy trunk. The automatic transmission was smooth and we experienced only a little �hunting� due to slight upgrades when in overdrive. It has a lockout switch conveniently mounted on the shift lever for those times when a lower gear would be preferable. Its quietness and lack of road noise was unexpected in a small car and most welcome amidst the heavy traffic. The air-conditioning was quite effective at cooling even the back seat passengers, which often suffer from poor ventilation when traveling in smaller cars.

There was little to fault in this lovely and well executed automobile. It exuded the quality that Toyota puts in all its products. When the time comes to purchase another car this one definitely deserves a look!
