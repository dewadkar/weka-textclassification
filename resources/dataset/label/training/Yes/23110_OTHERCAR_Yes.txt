            In the absence of a decent time machine,fiction remains the most viewable 
vehicle sturdy in it adventures to capture me by it,s view of the world.
On which this camera came in to being a reality in a sense. As a fan
of artwork I needed a good eye to see it again if I so desired to later.
The basics it took good looking pictures and also saved me money on 
developing of them.Also it was inexpensive in price for such an extension of my computer. I enjoyed playing around with it to linking my scanner into the uses too. A great features sense if you know what I mean.About the features of it they work but the physics must be remarkable. Everybody needs good memories of family and friends. It helps others find
things. Like for insurance purposes in photo,s of things maybe checking on legal matters like lawyers and doctors. In auto accidents be very helpful in crimes too. It is light to carry and has a nice case with it.
I Recommend that you buy rechargeable batteries for it.
