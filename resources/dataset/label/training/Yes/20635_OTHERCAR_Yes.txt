            <b>Introduction</b>
Here is information about my recent Audi purchase; the selection process, purchasing, option availability, etc. to assist people who might be interested in purchasing one of these fine vehicles.

<b><i>Choosing From All the Options</i></b>

<b>Selecting the Power Plant: Standard 2.8 vs. bi-Turbo 2.7T vs. 4.2 V8</b>
The first thing you'll probably need to decide when considering an Audi A6, besides color, is what engine to place under the hood. I discovered that several reviews, such as at Edmunds.com, implied that the A6 with the standard 2.8 was somewhat underpowered. If I remember correctly the 2.8 engine was the only one available in the 1999 model year and the 2.7L bi-Turbo and 4.2L V8 options were both new for 2000. Since the 2.7T was not <i>that much</i> more money than the 2.8 and still fit within my budget, I decided I was willing to spend the additional money now to ensure that I wouldn't regret not purchasing the increased power at any time during the next five years of ownership.

Other reviews and an honest dealer or two thought that the V8 4.2 wasn't any peppier than the 2.7T but was substantially more money. Judging by the specs that I saw for all three configurations, these other driver impressions seem to show in the field test results. Furthermore, other online reviews which compared the 4.2 to the 2.8 mentioned that the additional power over the standard 2.8 was worthwhile. So, since I'm basically a bargain hunter, I concluded that the extra power in the 2.7T was worthwhile, even necessary, but the 4.2L was only marginally more power for much more money. So I don't have the biggest engine available under the hood... at least my wallet's fatter.

<i>My conclusion: Bi-Turbo 2.7T</i>
So in order to get decent power, I moved up from the 2.8 to the 2.7T based upon lots of online and publication research.

<i>One Last Chance at the 4.2L V8</i> 
An Audi A6 4.2 does however come with more standard equipment than the 2.7T so I reconsidered the 4.2 from that perspective, i.e., would a <i>standard</i> 4.2 be price competitive with a <i>loaded</i> 2.7T? In my opinion, no, it still isn't price competitive. The few 4.2s that I was able to view in my area generally were loaded (although there isn't much you can add to an A6 4.2, they always included the navigation system) and MSRP was $65 - $72,000, substantially more than my 2.7T at roughly $44000.

<b>Other Vehicles That I Considered</b> 
<b>1.   BMW 528</b>   My reason for selecting the Audi A6? Better value. The Beemers had an attractive base price but wow, after putting on all the options I thought were required to make it comparable to the A6 2.7T, the 528 got real expensive. Plus, BMWs aren't discounted in this area. I'm sure the BMW is a great driving car but my impression is that it's more suited to hard driving enthusiasts and let's be practical, I'm 42 years old now so driving fast and furious no longer impresses me, (well, yes it is still thrilling but I have no safe place to do it). I commute, drive through traffic, haul kids &amp; dry cleaning and can't imagine needing a vehicle that is even more responsive than my A6. Any more response and I might feel the car becoming jumpy, nervous, twitchy or unpredictable. The 528 is probably be a great car but if you're considering a BMW you owe it to yourself to drive an A6 with an open mind. I think the handling of the A6 is very nimble and I can't imagine how the BMW could be <i>so much</i> better as to command the name-plate premium it does around here.

<b>2.   Acura RL</b>   This was a hard choice since my previous car was a '91 Acura Legend L and I loved it. Talk about value, the Acura RL and TL have it spades. Everything except the navigation system is standard in these fine cars. Unfortunately, they drove and looked somewhat bland to me, at least alongside the A6. There isn't anything bad you can say about the RL but there also doesn't seem to be anything great either. They're solid, well-performing, reliable and too much like that boy or girl in high school that you knew would keep you happy and comfortable the rest of your life but would never excite you either.


<b>Three-Year, All Scheduled Maintenance - Standard</b> 
Another bonus to the A6, one which let's face it, is included somewhere in your purchase price, is the 3-year, all scheduled maintenance provided by Audi. Granted, my car is too new to have used this yet but I'm looking forward to driving my car into the clean dealer service bay some Saturday morning and not worrying about the qualifications of the numbskull poking around my car. Other vehicles in this class provide long warranties but don't include all scheduled maintenance. Over the first three years, it can make a couple hundred dollar difference.


<b>Notes On My Purchase Experience</b>
<i>First Problem, Finding One</i>
First of all, I live in the Denver metro area and have just two dealerships to chose from within 50 miles. Neither are exclusively Audi and one is rather small. Within 150 miles there are three others. (However the third is in Aspen. and do you suppose in the land of $1.5 Million average home prices they ever negotiate a discount on any car?) Plus, Audi was not accepting factory orders then as they were making the changeover to their 2001 model year, or so I was told. Therefore, I had to search a bit and compromise a little to find what I wanted. Local selection was disappointing, at least in this area of predominantly SUV-lovers. In a &quot;more sophisticated&quot; area such as LA or Seattle or your_town, there may be more Audis on the lot to choose from.

<i>Ordering On-Line</i>
I also tried to order directly from carsdirect.com and carorder.com and even though they quoted me a decent price, neither one could find me the right vehicle. Both of these places were disappointing (a subject for another review). They strung me along for at least a week after accepting my car order and never really got back to me to tell me that they couldn't find a car at the price they quoted to me on their web site. I finally had to call them and extract from them that they couldn't deliver. In short, be wary of price quotes and promises from both companies, they apparently do not have a ready stock or cars and may promise more than they can deliver.

So you've been warned. Based upon my experience, don't expect to find exactly what you want on your first visit to an Audi dealer and don't expect the online sites to be have any better luck. 

<i>My Compromise</i>
I accepted my second color choice, no problem really, got my first choice in interior, wasn't willing to compromise there, and dropped the Sideguard and rear airbag options. I also gave up on finding the warm weather package although that could be a seasonal or regional availability issue. [Note: After driving the car during the summer and considering the superb response of the climate control system, I'm not sure this option is all that necessary in this area.] I did find that the options &amp; colors presented in the brochure and online was accurate, i.e., I did not experience any &quot;no longer available&quot; problems.

<i>What I Was Shut Out From Buying</i>
One option which I understand is just now appearing on some late-year 2000s is the electronic stability program. Because it is so new, I don't know much more about this other then the preliminary mention in my current owner's manual. It appears to be some additional traction control that selectively applies the brakes to individual wheels to prevent spinning and loss of control. Since I haven't tried this I can't recommend it but living here in Colorado, where we can expect snow from September through the end of April, this sounds like something which if it had been available, I probably would have tried to get.

<b>Money, Money, Money</b>
As for pricing, my quotes included two direct online car sellers at carsdirect.com and carorder.com and estimates from three dealerships.  All of these price sources seemed to agree. In the Colorado area, dealers all told me that Audi A6 2.7Ts go out the door at $1000 to $1500 off the MSRP. I paid $1900 off MSRP for mine (still 7+% over invoice) as it was right at the end of the month and they said they'd cut more off to meet March sales objectives. The fact is, the &quot;end of the month&quot; BS was probably just a story and every dealer I talked with was willing to at least start negotiating at $1000 to $1500 off MSRP. You might negotiate a better discount than I did. However, remember that unlike domestic autos, there are no dealer holdbacks or incentives available from Audi so it isn't fair to expect to pay only 2 - 3% over invoice. That invoice is really what the dealer paid and doesn't include any of their local costs, advertising or profit.

I know that when buying a car you should start at invoice and work up but that doesn't seem to work well in this situation. I wasn't real happy paying almost 8% over invoice but I'm not sure I could have done much better, even online. In my excitement to buy this car I may have come up from my first offer a little too eagerly but that's OK now. As Edmunds.com explains, there is no dealer holdback or current incentives on Audis so don't expect to get as close to invoice as with domestic cars. (See Edmunds.com for more explanation of dealer holdback.)

<b>Dealing With The Dealer</b>
As for my dealer, well, for anyone in the Denver metro area, I bought mine from Dave McManus at Prestige Imports. I was generally pleased at the way they treated me. Open, forthright and honest. I was pretty sold already on the A6 so they didn't have to &quot;sell me&quot; but I was still treated respectively. They didn't try to squeeze me or add on lots of extras to the invoice. They were actually pretty laid back. I also felt good about my three trips to McDonald Automotive Group in the SW area of town. They seem to be a decent shop and that's where I'll take my car for maintenance and service. I didn't purchase there because they're small and didn't have many A6s to choose from. I found what I was looking for at Prestige Imports and as you can tell from above, I didn't have many choices. If you like Silver though, you should be able to find what you want much easier.

<b>Conclusion</b>
As you can tell, I am real pleased with my Audi A6 2.7T and think it was worth the money and the effort it took to acquire it.
