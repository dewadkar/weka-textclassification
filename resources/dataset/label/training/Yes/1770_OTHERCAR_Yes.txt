            I just bought a 1997 Chrysler Sebring Lxi (this is the coupe model, not the convertible,which is an entirely different vehicle). I must say that this is the best-looking car I have ever owned.  What a head-turner!  I also feel that for the money, I got a really great car.  I shopped around quite a bit, and within my price range, the Sebring was far and away the best car I found.  The model I purchased is Paprika Red, leather interior, sunroof, stereo-CD, all power, and all the other extras on a fully-loaded car.

The car drives like a dream.  It handles curves so beautifully that I find myself searching out curvy roads just so I can test it out!  I would like a little faster acceleration, but that is minor.  The stereo is great, and the interior is roomy and comfortable. 

If you are in the market for a  sporty-looking car, I would suggest taking a look at a Sebring Coupe.  I am very satisfied with mine.<br><br>
