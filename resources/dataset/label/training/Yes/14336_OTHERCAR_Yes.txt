Now for my review:

I have been married for almost 6 years, and we just bought our 3rd Nissan car.  First we had a 95 Sentra, then a 97 Altima, and now we have this 2000 Altima.  I am working my way up the line (which means a Maxima is probably next) and someday I hope to have a Pathfinder.  But for now, I am super happy with my 2000 Nissan Altima.  

I hope I can do this car justice by reviewing it.  I love the car and all it has to offer and would recommend it to anyone!  Let�s get started...

<b>2000 Nissan Altima</b>

I have the GXE model and it is an Automatic 4-door model.  The exterior is a sleek and smooth design that is totally different from the 90�s models.  My 97 Altima had the long, rounded look, but the 2000 models are more �sporty� looking.  If I had to compare the body style to another car, I�d say it is similar to the 90�s models of the Honda Accord (4 door models).  This car has a 4-cylinder engine.


Here are the �standard� features of this car:

- Keyless/Remote Entry
- Security System
- Power Windows (on all 4 doors; can also lock 3 passenger window controls)
- Power Locks (on 2 front doors)
- Child Safety Locks (on rear doors)
- Air Conditioning/Heat
- Rear Defroster
- AM/FM Radio
- Cassette Player
- Compact Disc (CD) Player
- Tape and CD Storage Area
- 2 Cup Holders
- Dual Airbags
- Cruise Control
- 2 Front Overhead Lights / Center Light
- Lighted Mirrors (on both visors)
- Power Adjustable Rearview Mirrors
- 2 Cigarette Lighters (one in front of car on dash; other is in console; does not come with actual lighters)
- Anchors For Tether Straps (car seat restraints; 3 anchors-1 for each rear seat)
- Height Adjustable Seat Belts (front seats)

As you can see, this car has a lot of convenient features.  I am very happy with all of these features, especially the fact that is has both a cassette and a CD player!  This is great when you have a ton of cassettes and CD�s.  


<b>The Non-Girly, Guy Understood Facts</b>

Okay, now for the stuff that means nothing to me, and I do not understand most of it, but I know it�s essential for a car review.  

This car gets great gas mileage.  With the normal, everyday use, the car gets about 25-28 miles per gallon.  When traveling Interstate, the car gets about 30 miles to the gallon.  So this is not too bad.  It usually costs us about $13 or $14 to fill up the gas tank when gas runs around $1.00 per gallon.  

The car has a 4-cylinder engine, and I have no clue about the horsepower.  The only thing I know about the horsepower is that it <b>does</b> have more than my 97 Altima did.  I remember the sales person saying that at the dealership the day we bought it.  And I knew it did when I drove it because of the pickup the car had.  This car will get up and go, trust me.  It�s not a racecar, but it suits my needs just fine.

On the side of the gearshift, there is an "Overdrive" button that you can push to turn it on and off.  We leave it on because it gets better gas mileage that way. But if you are climbing a steep hill, or you just need some extra pickup, you can turn it off and it will give you more power or "umph".

<b>My Personal Experience</b>

This is a great car in my opinion.  It rides smoothly and comfortably, and we haven�t had any problems with it.  It has all the features we need and want, and it is roomy enough for my family of 3.  We have taken it on VERY long trips, and have not had any problems with room or with comfort.  The trunk is huge, and we have put a LOT of stuff in there before.  If you have ever traveled with a toddler, you know how much stuff you have to take on trips, and we have taken a 2 week trip before.  That�s a lot of stuff, and it all fits just fine.

This car seats 5 people comfortably, but if you throw car seats into the mix, I wouldn�t recommend putting more than 2 in the back.  Actually that might be impossible.  Car seats are bulky, and I don�t think more than 2 would fit back there.  I wouldn�t even want to try that.

My car is "Dusk Blue" which is a light blue/gray/silver color and it has the glitter effect.  I really like this color because you can't really tell when it's dirty.  The interior is gray, and the seats are upholstered, which I prefer over leather seats (I live in the SOUTH where it gets HOT and sticky!)

I am very happy with my car, and would recommend it to anyone (except those with more than 2 car seats).  Since this is my 3rd Nissan, and we have had excellent experience with all 3 of them, I will probably keep buying Nissans.
