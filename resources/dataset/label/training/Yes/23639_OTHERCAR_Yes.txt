            The Jeep Cherokee is an outstanding vehicle.  It is the perfect size and build for rough city driving.  It allows me to negotiate tough potholes, yet it is not some mammoth that I can't park whenever I want.  It has an advantage over the Jeep Wrangler in that it is not a tenny-bopper vehicle and I can commute to work in it with a suit on and not get rained on.  

Additionally, it has the advantage over the Grand Cherokee in that it has the same functionality at a significantly reduced cost.  

Moreover, my clients, many of whom are tried and true blue collar types, appreciate the fact that I drive what is generally perceived as an American vehicle rather than one of those tinny Japanese sport-utils.  

The Jeep Cherokee allows me to travel with clients during the weekdays, given the wide acceptance of sport utils today, and to make it out to the duck camp or the fishing ramp on the weekends. 

This is my third Jeep vehicle, and I stand by it as it has stood by me.  My last one lasted 350,000 miles.<br><br>
