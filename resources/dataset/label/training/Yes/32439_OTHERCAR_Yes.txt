            This car is one of the most spectacular cars that I have ever seen. The Ferrari 360 Modena is named for a city in Italy where the very first Ferraris were built. It's the result of a four-year production plan. In this plan, the engineers centered on four main objectives: weight reduction, refined aerodynamics, greater interior space and, of course, enhanced performance. Eventually the 360 Modena will replace the very popular 355 as the 'entry-level' Ferrari, although the convertible 355 Spider model will stay in production until a similar version of the 360 Modena arrives late in 2000. The 360 Modena is different in almost every way with the whole car designed coming from scratch, adopting new materials and construction methods. The 360 Modena achieves weight reduction by replacing the old part steel / part aluminum body with an all-aluminum chassis, bodyshell and numerous other components. The 360 is different compared to the 355 with a longer wheelbase, longer vehicle length, the lack of pop-up headlights and the hallowed Ferrari grille replaced by two widely spaced intake areas. There is also a completely redesigned engine, the 3.6-liter, 90 degree V8 is mounted in-line, centrally located behind the cabin. It delivers 400 bhp at 8500 rpm, making it the most powerful normally aspirated V8 ever built by Ferrari. It delivers 275-ft. lbs. of torque at 4750 rpm. Like the 355, the 360 Modena is equipped with a 6-speed manual gearbox designed to work with either a manual gear lever or the F1-type system. The Formula One manual gearbox, activated by levers just behind the steering wheel, allows for shifting without the driver using a clutch. A Drive-By-Wire system ensures that the engine remains at the ideal speed indicated by the transmission control unit throughout the gearshift resulting in smoother shifting and greater comfort. The 360 Modena can be obtained with a mere $138,225 for the Berlinetta 6-Speed while the F1 version will list at $147,725. Amenities at this price include 18-inch, 5-spoke magnesium wheels, powerful 4-wheel ventilated brakes, driver-adjustable suspension, complete Connolly leather interior and the satisfaction of owning an automotive and engineering work of art. In English, ITS THE BOMB!!<br><br>
