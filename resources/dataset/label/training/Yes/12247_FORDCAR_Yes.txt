            I bought this vehicle for a couple of reasons.  First living in Hawaii I needed a vehicle that won't collect rust, Second a vehicle that is reliable vehicle, Finally a vehicle that I can put to work and hauling things for people making a little extra money on the side.  I have done just about every thong I my Ranger.  I transport military parts for my job section all the time.  All the people I work with like to drive it on the weekend when I'm not doing anything, just because they like to go bike riding or atv riding.  Well then if you are looking for a truck that is reliable and affordable then this is the truck for you.<br><br>
