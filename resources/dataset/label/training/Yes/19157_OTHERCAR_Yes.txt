            This vehicle was an after lease purchase which was by far the worst thing we did (lease a car).  For the first time new car buyers we were very pleased with what the Volkswagon dealership had to offer.  The only drawback was there was no haggling at all but we did get the 6 disk changer thrown in. But after much research on Edmunds and on other sites we were very pleased with the price. 

If you like the German style of cars this would be a car for you to consider!  It has much more room than appears from the outside, both leg room and head room.  All the amenities are easily defined and easy to use. The drawback to this car, we have the V6, is the mpg.  We are averaging about 18 miles in the city.  The highway was a little better getting about 25 mpg.  

This is a very fun car to drive and being able to switch from standard to automatic is fun but we honestly do not use it that much.  The car handles very well and is very quick and very fast--which is bad because it is very smooth..as the cop said when I was pulled over &quot;smooth as sin.&quot;
