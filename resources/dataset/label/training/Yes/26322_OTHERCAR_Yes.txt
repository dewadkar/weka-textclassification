            When my '89 Toyota Corolla bit the dust, I thought I would have to buy some piece of junk I hated. Much to my surprise, this 2 door Honda came in at $11,000 and I love it! What a nice little car. Totally reliable, easy to deal with and the payments are affordable. I'm not a big car guy. I don't get all hot at mention of horsepower and stuff like that. A car is a box that gets me where I want to go and if it's comfortable, cheap, and reliable -- I'm happy.

My one complaint (and this is really a nit) is that the lever of the side of the seats doesn't move the seat up -- it only flips the back forward. To move the seat up, you have to actually get in the seat and reach underneath. A minor pain but it happens a lot as I have a toddler and every time I put her in the car seat, I have to scrunch around. But really, a nit. the car is totally awesome otherwise.
