              I bought a 1990 Toyota 4X4, V-6, Automatic, Deluxe SR-5 
about 5 years ago with 64,000 miles on it. 

This particular truck unlike many came with a rare, 
from the factory options package. (Longbed + Automatic 
Transmission) Normally the long bed used by contractors 
and such professions to haul larger and heavier loads 
would come accompanied by the standard transmission.

 I have had absolutely no problems with this truck. 
Currently the odometer reads 150,019 miles! And this 4X4 
still purs like the day it was driven off the showroom floor! 

And trust me, It hasn't been babied in the least other than 
keeping it clean. (Honestly, Toyota worked up a bad reputation
years ago with the bad rust problem. Due in part to the 
multi part truck beds.) But I keep this 90 Toy washed and 
waxed and here it is 10 years later with no rust! Keep that 
in mind- Keeping it clean is keeping it Rust-Free! It's as 
easy as that to protect your investment. What's getting your
hands wet to protect thousands of dollars?  

So, I've taken this truck off-roading several times. 
And I must tell you, Although lacking the power of a V-8 
is hard to overcome, this 90 Toyota can hold it's own when 
traveling off-road. It's light weight and wheel stance is 
#1 when it comes to making it through deep mud and water 
and climbing unstable rocks and hills. The way the truck is 
set up makes up for the lack of power. Heavier trucks such 
as your full size Chevy pickups with a V-8 will sink faster 
than the little Toyota! 

Downfall- I haven't had much luck with pulling larger 'stuck' 
vehicles from their sink holes. The Toyota seems to slack
in this area of pulling. Not to get me wrong about pulling trailers
and those sort of loads. Trailering causes some loss of power,
but it pulls comfortablly.

So, over 150,000 miles and I expect to get another 150,000 
with ease. Other than brakes and oil changes, this truck has 
had next to nothing for repairs! I would recommend purchasing a 
Toyota Pickup to anyone. Since I've owned mine, friends have bought 
their own because they have witnessed how this truck has treated me. 

Another note: I drove about 2,200 miles round-trip from Wisconsin 
to Denver, Colorado without a worry. I'd drive it anywhere, any 
distance and not have to worry about wether or not I belong to AAA. 
Having a vehicle you can trust and rely on makes day to day driving 
and living much easier and stress free. Unlike those that are 
taking their vehicle into the shop week after week for repairs. 
I hope you look further into buying a Toyota Pickup. It's well worth your hard earned dollars. And that applies to purchasing new or used.<br><br>
