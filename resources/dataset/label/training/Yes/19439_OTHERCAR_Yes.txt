            I have bought a 99 CRV4WD EX manual transmission a little over a year ago and I have loved it ever since.  I have put about 17,000 miles on it mostly on the highway. I have taken one long road trip with from Tennessee to Utah and Arizona and back. I have even taken it on off road trails where it handled very well considering it's based on a Civic wagon chassis. The fact its on a car chassis instead of a trucks is one of its strong points, this gives it a smoother ride over most all SUV's in that price range and even better than some higher priced ones. This does affect its off road performances slightly but this is not a real problem because this is not a trail blazing vehicle and most people who drive SUV's don't really do any serious off road driving. 
	The interior of the car is very well laid out with easy to use controls and a very clutter free dashboard. The controls for the windows are in a strange place, to the left of the steering wheel on the dashboard, this takes some getting use to but is very easy once you are use to it. The back seat is very roomy, more than big enough for 2 adults and the cargo space can hold a reasonable amount of luggage. 
	Mechanically the car is very well engineered, it's a front wheel drive car and in the 4WD versions of the car the rear wheels kick in when the front wheels slip. The transition from the 2WD to 4WD is very smooth, you feel a slight kick in the rear of the car as they engage and nothing as they disengage. The 99 model has 20 more horsepower than the previous models. That was a major complaint in the earlier model year. My only major complaint is the engine runs very high in 5th gear at 70 mph; I tend to find my self trying to shift in to 6th. One thing I would like to see added to the car but which has no affect on the performance is some way to switch in to 4WD so if you see a rough spot ahead you can be ready instead of waiting for you to slip. 
   	It gets very nice fuel mileage for its size. In fact on my trip out west the car which was fully loaded with camping gear and food for 3 adults for 1 week in the desert got around 20 to 21 mpg most of the way. 
I suggest you get the manual transmission because you can get more power out of the engine than with an automatic. The four-cylinder engine is just big enough to pull the car but its not too overpowered for its size like some other cars. Another reason I think in this car manual is better than automatic is the gear shift is on the steering column and its kind of tricky to use and get in to the gear you want. 
Over all this is a very good car with no major faults. It's a tough car, (I was hit from behind by a new El Dorado a few months ago and I hardly had a scratch on my car while the El Dorado was smashed in. It was not a high-speed accident, it was under 30 mph but I was still impressed with the lack of damage to my car). This is definitely a car for those who want the space and ride height of an SUV but don't really need the 4WD and the expense that other Suv's offer.
