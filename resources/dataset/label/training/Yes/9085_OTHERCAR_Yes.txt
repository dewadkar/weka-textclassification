            As a single mother of two, I was faced with the need to purchase a vehicle when my car with 193,000 miles finally died in May, 1999.  

I wanted something that would be dependable, affordable and able to get us out of any mess we may find ourselves in during Indiana blizzards.  I have been tremendously pleased with the performance, maintenance and comfort of my 1999 Kia Sportage 4x4.  I have taken road trips with as many as 4 kids and 2 adults and it has handled very well. 

Not having the option of investing $30,000 into a vehicle, I am extremely pleased with the value I received with my Kia.  My only hope is that soon they will offer it with a 6 cylinder engine, however, the power and response from the 4 cylinder has been great.  

I put a new set of brake shoes on a couple of weeks ago (I've put over 26,000 miles on already!)  I had to go back to the dealer to get the pads but replaced them myself and found it to be an easy job.<br><br>
