            I was looking for my first car. I was working and just got out of high school. I was getting rides from my mom and wasn't able to get out much. I found this car sitting outside a pawn shop. I thought that it might not be such a good idea, but hey I really needed the wheels. It was a 1990 and the price was 2500.00 so I bought it.
  I have owned it for 5 years now and all I had to change on it was brake pads. I couldn't believe it. It has all the original parts. It still runs like the day that I bought it. The steering isn't powered, but it is realistic. I drive it in snow a lot and have never gotten into an accident with it. 
  It is two door which makes it hard for people to get into the back seat, but once you get back there you have plenty room to sit. The trunk is a nice size for such a little car. Another thing that I like about it is that it has rubber bumpers. So if you hit something it does very little damage. The air in it is okay, but the heater is excellent. It heats up in less than five minutes.
  I would recommend this car to people who want a reliable car and that are just starting out.

Just an update I finally had to replace the muffler and the tail pipe 08/2000. I think that I am going to take it in for a tune-up soon. Not bad for a 10 year old car.
