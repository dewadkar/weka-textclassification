            This is my second Prizm.  I got the very last of the Geo line with my second purchase and once again, I am not disappointed.  Both times I bought the manual.  It's fun to drive and is completely reliable.  The only time (besides regular maintenance) that my first Prizm had to be taken into the shop for repairs was because of an accident and not because of something that was wrong with the car.  A friend who is a dealer told me that it is one car that he never sees in the shop, and I believe him.  It's the perfect size and has a lot of room in the trunk.  The doors are light, so they don't smash your leg when you're trying to get in and out of it.  I highly recommend this car -- especially the 5-speed.<br><br>
