            I recently leased a 2000 Honda Odyssey and I am  very happy with it.  The lease was up on my car and I started out looking for a larger car to buy as I have 2 growing children and travel a lot with them.  I was surprised to find that the larger family cars were just as expensive or more expensive the average minivan. 

Before deciding on the Odyssey I looked at almost every van out there.  A big priority for me was the safety factor.  I only considered the vans that performed highly in the crash tests, so that automatically ruled out some that I would have considered like the Nissan Quest and the Chevy Venture.  The safest vans that I found according to my research were the Ford Windstar, the Toyota Sienna and the Honda Odyssey.  

The Windstar was a very nice looking van but I've heard that it's not very reliable according to Consumer Reports.   It does have a reversing sensor that I would have liked since I have never owned  a van before.
But like I said I read and have heard from friends that the reliability isn't there.

The Toyota Sienna was a very nice van also.  It is definitely smaller than the others.  When I sat in the driver's seat I felt very cramped and it didn't seem that easy to walk through.  There wasn't much room.

As soon as I saw the Honda Odyssey I knew I had to have it.  There are so many nice features.  It's very big and roomy.  I love the &quot;magic seat&quot; that folds into the floor.  It is really so easy to convert.  I also love the  dip in the cargo area.  It really does make it easier to pack the trunk so everything doesn't roll all over the place.  The controls are all well placed and easy to get to.  I really like having the radio controls on the steering wheel.  It drives so nicely. It is not sluggish at all and has nice pick-up.  I also noticed how quiet the ride is.  

The only things I don't like about the van are the automatic doors.  I do get nervous with the kids using them because they are not sensitive at all (the doors, not the kids that is).  I put myself in the way of the closing door and it really seemed to hit me hard before reversing.  

On a scale of 1 to 10, it's a definite 10!      <br><br>
