            I bought a new Toyota Echo 2000 in November of 1999. I have had a wonderful time with this car. Very easy to drive, very responsive steering and braking. This car is VERY roomy for a small car. My husband is 200+ pounds and can fit very comfortably in the car, including the rear seat. It has lots of trunk space and storage slots and even a storage tray under the passenger seat. We added a 6 disc CD changer as an option but the standard stereo system is very good. The rear seat has built in child seat receptacle on the back window shelf. The rear seats unlock and fold down to access the trunk from the inside. Very nice when we went on vacation, put a cooler with snacks in the trunk near the rear seat and could get at it without having to carry it inside the car. One of the features I like is the fuel door lever located on the drivers side floorboard. The fuel door can not be opened from the outside of the vehicle and no fumbling with gas cap keys. I have never been a small car person, always driven pickup truck or sport utility vehicles, but this car has changed my mind about small cars. This one is a real winner!!!<br><br>
