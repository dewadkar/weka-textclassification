            We just bought our new (to us) Accord about 2 months ago because we have a toddler and another baby due around Thanksgiving 2000. We NEED the room! We did have a 1989 Honda Accord LX-i coupe. It was a two door, and tough to get an infant car seat in and out of. But we had very few problems out of it, and it was a nice little car.

We started looking around for a new car, and at first considered buying a 2000 Nissan Sentra. We shopped around, but finally it was back to the Honda dealership for us. We looked at the 2000 models, but decided they were out of our price range.

Then we saw it! A green (my favorite color), four door (what we needed!), five speed 1998 Honda Accord. The price was right at under $16,000, and it had all the options we wanted, except a moon roof and it had fairly low mileage (30,000_. We test drove it, and had our favorite mechanic check it out for us. We discussed it, and when they told us it was still under factory warranty, we decided to buy it right then and there!

Since we've been driving it, we have no idea how we got along in a two door! It is very roomy, and comfortable! Lots of trunk space, and leg room. If you are thinking about buying a bigger car for your extending family, I highly suggest this car!<br><br>
