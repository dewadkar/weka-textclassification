              We recently traded our 1997 Chevrolet Venture for a lease on a 2000 Venture. We loved our old one, but it was the shorter model and we needed the extended version. Boy, we have not been disappointed!! The 2000 Extended model is sooo long.  We have plenty of space now for all our stuff, groceries, and most importantly, our three children and the two car seats that they require. 
  It delivers a very smooth ride and is extremely easy to handle, too.
  The seats are cloth, which is great for us, because they don't get too cold in the winter and they don't get hot in the summer. We don't allow our kids to eat or drink in the car unless we are on a long road trip, so staining is not a problem for us.
   The van also gets great gas mileage. With three kids, two of which are in school/preschool, I am on the road a lot and I rarely have to fill up more than once a week or so.
   The seat belts are very sturdy and we have had no problems with them as we buckle in our kids' car seats, which gives us great peace of mind as we travel around.
   The radio/cassette/cd player is awesome, too. It has great sound and lots of bells and whistles, while being very easy to operate.
  I have nothing negative to say about our van.  It is awesome and I highly, highly recommend it!!<br><br>
