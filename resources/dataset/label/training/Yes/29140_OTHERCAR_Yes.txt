            The old image in my mind of laughing when ugly beaten up volvos(the only kind I used to see) passed by, was erased when I laid eyes on the V70. This is a car for everyone whether it be a soccer mom wanting room for his son's equipment and one of the safest cars out there, or a college student wanting a car that is so good looking, it turns heads. This car is definetely a big turn-around and impresses the hell outta me. This is also not a car that you'll have to get used to compared to getting something like a kia which is smaller than a newborn baby or an SUV that eats gas and you can't fit into a parking spot. Congratulations on one of the best cars out right now Volvo. A great buy, Go for it!!!
