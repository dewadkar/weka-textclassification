            I purchased my Neon used after my car was totaled while parked in front of my house. I had always driven Fords and was leery of trying something I wasn't familiar with, but it's turned out to be a wonderful experience.
I test drove about 20 cars in search of &quot;the car&quot;, and after driving my 1997 Neon I fell in love.
   It's sporty looking and drove like a dream. It gets great gas mileage and seats 4 adults and a kid quite comfortably. Everything (ac, stereo, etc) is within easy reach for someone my height (5'3&quot;). I love the way it handles. It gives a smooth ride and shifts easily, (I have the 5 speed).
I can honestly say mine has yet to give me any trouble. 
   If I were to be forced to look for something bad or annoying about it I'd have to say there is a small lag when shifting too low. You have to maintain decent RPM's to keep that from happening, but since I've driven sticks all my life that was easy enough to get used to.
   I have to say for the price, and with the low mileage it was a steal. A great little car that I will hold onto until the next drunk driver hits me.<br><br>
