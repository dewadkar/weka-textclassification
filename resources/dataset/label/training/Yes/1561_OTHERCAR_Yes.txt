            We bought our Dodge minivan brand new in the year 1995.  I had to have a white one because it looks cleaner. Well to me it does anyway.  I will never ever have another vehicle but a minivan while I still have kids in the house.  The Front is very roomy but the back doesnt have very much room if you want to go on a trip so we usually end up taking a bench seat out.  Which is very easy to do.  Kinda heavy but maybe Im just weak. Cleans very easily and really Drives smoothly.  Very easily sits 7 people comfortably.  I love the design of the Dodge minivans body it seems really classy to me. So I defiantly give the Dodge Minivan two thumbs up and would not trade mine for anything.<br><br>
