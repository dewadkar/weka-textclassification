            I love my Sony Mavica FD73!  Light-weight, long-lasting battery (2hrs),
zoom, black and white option, easy to operate, AND greatest feature is ability to take LIMITLESS photos by using inexpensive floppy disks!!

Though the camera was approximately $500, the advantage of using floppy disks instead of memory cards with limited space justified the cost.  I can go on a trip and take 10 or 20 disks (or purchase more while traveling as they are so inexpensive!) and know I can just click away and not be concerned that I'm wasting film.  

Another big advantage is ability to immediately view my photo; and if necessary delete and retake the picture.  How often when taking a group photo does one person have their eyes closed?  Another a silly face? It is VERY convenient and easy to try again until the photo is right! 

Making prints...this is a FUN camera!  An example:  I attended a baby shower this summer.  Ran around photographing everyone and lots of candid shots.  Immediately we could all view the pictures right on the camera. Her husband was so excited I popped out the disk so he could make copies of all the good photos for his family and all the guests!  What great memories to take home!

Color is quite good even is low light.  As far as printing  I just use regular copy paper unless a photo is particularly good.  Then I use the photo paper which does an excellent job.

Having this camera has spoiled me and I find it difficult to take the regular 35mm on a trip.

I have owned my camera since June 1999 and feel I made an excellent choice!<br><br>
