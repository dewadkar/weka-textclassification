            The Chevrolet S-10 is a good truck for the buck.  We  have two, we like them so much.  My truck is a 91 S-10.  I think it is a good all around truck.  It will get you where you have to go, when you need to be there.  The only thing is the road noise is a bit loud at times, and it could use a better seat.  It is very roomy for a small truck, but if you are over six feet tall you might better look into an extended cab for better leg room.  The radio is good except for the fact that you have to reach for the controls.  They are just too far away from the driver.  It will pull like a mack truck.  The tounge weight limit is about 500 pounds.  We pulled our 21' cuddy cabin boat with it,and I think the tounge is about 800 pounds or so.  It will pull a two ton boat with little trouble at all.  The 2.8 liter engine is fairly strong.  My overall opinion is this is a well built truck.  I think any one would be happy with one of these.<br><br>
