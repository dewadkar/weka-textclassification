            I bought this Vehicle because of it's good looks,it's reputation and price.The handling is OK but not what I am used to.Acceleration is OK but not spectacular.The transmission seems to shift a lot in overdrive.The car is very noisy inside at higher speeds.The radio controls are not easy to find without taking your eyes off the road and looking directly at them.The seats are comfortable in front but I have yet to take it on a long trip.I'm getting about 29 miles per gallon,not as much as I expected.The tilt steering wheel is virtually worthless.If you want a basic sporty looking car that doesn't cost a bundle and is dependable it's a great car.If you are looking for speed and great handling you're not going to like it.<br><br>
