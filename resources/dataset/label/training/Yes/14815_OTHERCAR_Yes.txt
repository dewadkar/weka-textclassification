            Just test drove a 1999 WS-6 Trans Am.  Wow!!!  Everything is great about this engineering marvel.  320 Horsepower and a 6 speed that's good for endless fun.  The handling is very well defined especially with the WS-6 package which includes 17&quot; wheels, ram air induction, and a sportier suspension.  The acceleration is immaculate with the 3.42 gear ratio yet the gas mileage betters that of the rival mustang.  

As far as the bad sides, well space in the back seats are not very adequate but what do you expect from a sports car.  Basically they are meant for kids.  Also depending on where you live, this is definately not a all year around vehicle.  With all the power pumping from the LS-1, traction will virtually non-existant when you try to start from a dead stop on a little snow or ice.  You also must hold back on the lead foot when it is rainy outside.<br><br>
