            How I survived so long with a mini van with only once sliding door is amazing.  For christmas I got a double door mini van.  I have been wanting one for as long as they have been around but never came across a good enough deal to get one.
  Finally. Plymouth has a great deal for the end of the year.  As do all dealerships I assume.  But we ran across this deal and couldn't pass it up.
   The van has the dual air control, front and back.  Also has the head sets in the back for the the kids to listen to their own music.  The 2 seats in the back fold down to make a queen size bed if the need arises.  I think it would be for people that are camping out or something.
  It has great gas mileage.  And has something that my Ford Windstar didn't have.  It has more get up and go.  I can get out in traffic easier with this one.  
  It has the panel overhead to hold the sun glasses and garage door opener as well as the mommy mirror that we all need.  The seats are the most comfortable seats I have sat in.
  The price was wonderful, the service from the dealership is top notch.
I can't say enough about it.  I will update this epinion soon.  But wanted to drop in and give you information I have so far.  I have only had the van for 3 days so its still new to me and I have a lot to learn still.<br><br>
