            This is a vehicle for the individual wanting a solid SUV but with a car-like ride.  I purchased the 1999.5 Pathfinder SE Limited 4X4 after stepping out of a Ford Expedition.  The differences between the two are substantial (more power/room for Expedition, better fit-and-finish/quality for Pathfinder, etc...) but I am very pleased with the choice that I made.  The Pathfinder is a sturdy vehicle that rides comfortably both on small hops or longer excursions.  Interior noise level is low which is pleasant especially on longer trips.  Color schemes available are outstanding (Silver is very nice) and the upholstery is comfortable and durable.  The sound system for the Nissan is nice but I found the Expedition to have richer and better distributed sound (possibly a result of larger cabin?).

Cargo space is limited but what is available is functional.  Access/Egress is easy as you are not falling into/out of the vehicle (as is the case for larger SUVs).  Braking appears to be quicker (especially on snow/ice) when I compare it to the Expedition.  The Nissan with ABS does not lock-up as the Expedition did when braking on snow/ice.  Some impact could be attributed to the lighter weight of the Nissan but locking up was an issue I attribute to the Expedition.

An area where the Nissan could use improvement is the engine.  Here, the Nissan could use an additional 50 hp.  I am able to hold speed on the highway (75-80 mph) but find that passing can be problematic.  Travelling in the mountains is also somewhat difficult and an area where a boost in horsepower would definitely help.

However, all-around the Nissan is a pleasure to drive with no mechanical/fit-and-finish problems encountered to date (total of 3800 miles driven).  I personally am happy with my decision to purchase this vehicle.<br><br>
