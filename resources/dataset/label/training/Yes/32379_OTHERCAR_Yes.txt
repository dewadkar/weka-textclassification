            The Navigator is the most luxurious vehicle on the road.  It provides for a very smooth ride.  The vehicle is extremely comfortable to take long road trips in.  You can fit eight people comfortably.  The only downfall is the amount of gasoline it uses.  You have plush leather seats which are also equipped with heat for the winter.  Anyone who can afford to purchase this SUV should.  You cannot go wrong.  A little bit hard to park at first, until you get use to the size but well worth it. The vehicle could use a little more trunk space.  If you place the third row down you get more trunk space but that takes away three seats.<br><br>
