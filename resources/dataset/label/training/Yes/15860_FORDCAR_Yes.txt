            I have driven Chevy, Dodge, GMC, and even Harvester trucks.  By far I still find my Ford pickups the best there is.  I bought a F250 Super Duty Extended Cab 4x4 pickup with the 7.3 diesel.  I love this engine!!!!  With my heavily laden camper, my family, dog, and stuff it just cruised up and down hills and mountain passes without ever slowing down.  Previously my favorite Ford engine had been the 300 6-cylinder.  It was extremely reliable, but it just did not have much power at upper highway speeds when loaded.  With the diesel engine I set the cruise control at about 65 mph and never slowed down while traveling through the passes on the interstate 5 from Oregon to California.  The fuel economy is just about what you would expect from this class of engine, 16-18 miles per gallon.  I suppose my chief complaint about the truck would be how noisy the diesel engine is.  I guarantee that if Ranger Walker had this engine he would not sneak up on anybody with it unless they were completely deaf.  Of course, the F250 is just a bit bumpy without any load in the back--it's a 4x4 super duty.  I've taken the trunk onto the sandy beaches at Long Beach and driven up and down the coast line with no problems.  The four wheel drive just goes.  When wandering up into the Cascades I just put it in four wheel drive and never have a problem in the snow.  All in all, in spite of the engine noise and unloaded intestine rattling ride, I love this truck.  If you need a truck this size or just think you do like me, this is the right one. <br><br>
