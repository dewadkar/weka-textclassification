<TEXT>
            I leased my discovery in '96. I looked at several of the SUVs in the same class. For price and what you get I found the Discovery to be the best deal. It comes fully loaded with what others give only as options. 

The new Discoverys are really nice. When my lease is up in June I am considering getting one.  Since BMW bought Land Rover they did a redesign on a majority of the interior.  They have a lot more features and designs. <br>
