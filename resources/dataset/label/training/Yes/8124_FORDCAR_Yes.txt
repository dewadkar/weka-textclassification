                 I recently purchased a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport; it has EVERY option available except for leather. I think that the MSRP sticker came to $29,180; like I said... Lots of options. Please keep in mind while reading this review that my previous daily driver that I traded in was a 4-cylinder Jeep Wrangler [rough comparison.. for the Jeep! :) ]

     The reason that me and my fianc�e were looking at the Explorer were because we always wanted an SUV (we didn't really qualify the Wrangler as an SUV), and the current deals out there were very hard to pass up.
I believe that because of all the bad press that Ford has received in the past year makes it very difficult for them to sell these particular vehicles. However, if you remember I think that it was the 2001 4-door Explorers (older body style) with a tendency to flip over, the 2-door sport has a different suspension and of course they all have different tires now (Goodyear). 

          The dealer that we went to was Metro Ford in Schenectady, NY. They had plenty of 2002s being sold but they still had 13 2001 Explorer Sports, not only that but they all had virtually every conceivable option.

There was an "option package discount" of $700, then a manufacturer's rebate of $3000, as well as another $1000 just to get us out the door and help out the trade. Now these numbers may not be the most accurate because I traded in a car, and when you trade ANYTHING in (especially something that you owe money on) you are going to get a little fogged with the way the numbers get manipulated. I still think that I made out well.
OK, enough, let�s talk about the vehicle...

     First, I would have to say it has one of the best stock stereo systems that I have ever experienced, the only one that I ever heard come close was the Acura Vigor and that didn't have a subwoofer. The truck had the special "Audiophile" stereo system upgrade which consists of an in-dash 6-disc changer, with built in Digital effects as well as a moderately large subwoofer in the rear hatch on the passenger�s side. I actually wasn't aware of the subwoofer until we got it home, I was actually worried since we thought that the "thumping" noise might be a faulty speaker! The DSP effects are settings that emulate the sound being played in different acoustic settings, church, stadium, etc. They are basically just EQ settings mixed with light to heavy amounts of echo and reverb. Might be gimmicky in today�s day and age, but still very cool.

The ride seems very smooth, and the truck has a good amount of power in any driving situation (good highway passing power). I can't really comment on the gas mileage, but I'll get back to you. The front seats are very comfortable, they will be excellent for long trips, the back ones are kind of flimsy in comparison, but with a 2-door sport UTE the back seats and lack of 4-doors is really the only flaw. The "sport" is a 2-door vehicle so complaining about the lack of 2 more doors probably isn't really fair anyways.
The vehicle looks excellent in my opinion and the sport package alloy wheels look quite cool. Built-in running boards, as well as fog lights and tow hooks are part of the package as well. The inside is very nice with everything easy to reach; the dials are easy to read, etc.
It�s a great truck and at the current prices its tough to beat, they are dying to get rid of these things, and I was happy to oblige.
