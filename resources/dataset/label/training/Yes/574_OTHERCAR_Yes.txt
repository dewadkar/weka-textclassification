            we bought this to replace a 93 grand prix that was totaled in a wreck.
we test drove and priced a lot of cars, and this one was every bit as good as the pricey ones. it is roomy enough for this family of three, handles well, and is very fuel efficient. a plus in this age of rising gas prices. the seats can get a little uncomfortable on long trips, but that is about the only downside of this car. at 12,100 fully equipped with
cd player, tinted windows, a/c and auto. it is a great value.
i would recommend this car to anyone that needs a vehicle to get from a to b without a lot of frills or fuss. also would be good for first time drivers or college kids on a tight budget. it handles well, passes with ease, and has great get up and go when necessary. i get a lot of sneers when people ask me what i bought, but for the price, i find it just as good and reliable as the Toyota or Honda. and it comes with an unbeatable warranty.<br><br>
