            Ever since I got my license, I have only driven small cars.  I have never driven an SUV before, but I was interested in finding out more about them.  I looked into many SUV's...Blazers, Explorers, Rodeos...but the SUV I was most interested in was the Nissan Pathfinder.  When my father took me to the car store, as soon as I saw the Pathfinder, I knew that was the car I just had to have.  My father wanted to make sure it was safe and reliable, which it is, and he wanted to make sure it was a reasonable price.  After talking to the car salesman for a while and inquiring about the car, I decided it was the car for me.  The only thing is, I was a little bit nervous about driving such a big car.  But after being on the road in my Pathfinder for a little while, I realized it was not much different than driving a smaller car.  Plus, it has 4 wheel drive, which comes in handy in the North, where I live.  I definitely recommend the Nissan Pathfinder.<br><br>
