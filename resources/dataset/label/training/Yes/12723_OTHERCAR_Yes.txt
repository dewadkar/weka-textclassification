            I'll start out telling you that I'm/was a Toyota enthusiast.  I had a Celica that I did very little to in the way of an oil change and timing belt replacement.  Then I went shopping for a 4Runner and sticker shock set in!

So I trudged across the street to the Mitsubishi dealer and drove off the lot in my Montero Sport.  I have to tell you, this is the best ride of any of the SUVs that I've test drove! 

From the first time I took it off the lot, I've never had any problems with it.  NONE!  That's not to say that other people have experienced some things but this car has not caused me any problems.  I have the LS 4x2 model.

I just took it in early December '00 for its 30K mile service and it rides like the day I bought it. Tight suspension and feel and overall, the service people were also excellent.  

The gages are properly displayed but would be nice to see battery life indicator.  The extras including the CD player has never given me a problem.   

I love the fact that the seats are easy to put down.  My wife and I have it down in about 30 seconds.  It'll take about 2 minutes by yourself.  Still, that's pretty good considering you're removing the headrests as well.

The passengers have plenty of leg room and have gone a couple times to Tahoe with another couple in the back and commented on how car like of a ride it was and with good legroom.  

The only thing that I wish that Mitsubishi could have done better is make a more solid cup holder and put it out of the way from the stereo.  It's pretty much impossible to see what station you're on once you have a cup in the cup holder.  Also, my antennae broke and had to be replaced.  We live in an extremely windy part of Bay Area and so I think it took its wear and tear.  Also, I bumped it a few times which didn't help.  

Other than that, I would HIGHLY recommend this SUV to anyone considering either a new or 1998 Montero Sport.<br><br>
