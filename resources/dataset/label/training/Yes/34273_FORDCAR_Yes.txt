            We purchased this truck for my wife to drive. Why a pickup truck for a woman who works in an office building?  Safety, for starters.   For about $20,000 you can have a reasonably comfortable and liveable vehicle that weighs 4,000 lbs and will be safer in a crash than a comparably priced car.  To get anything approaching this degree of safety in a car, you have to move into the $40,000 and up price range. The only negatives of a pickup are a slightly higher risk of rollover, and in some cases, longer stopping distances and less maneuverability.

 The F-150 is rated 4 stars in frontal impact tests, and 5 stars in side impact tests by the NHTSA (you know, the one like where a 80 y/o grandmother  runs a stop sign and you have no time to react).   I also liked the fact that you sit higher up, and are less likely to be injured by another truck or SUV (imagine the bumper of a jacked up 4x4 kissing you on the forehead).  A car hitting you in the side might even  dissipate all its forces on the frame below your feet, not your body.  We also have a huge Dodge Ram pickup, but surprisingly, the Ford beats it in all the crash tests.  

The F-150 is a cut above the Dodge and older Chevrolet models in terms of handling, quietness, ride, and braking.   Our 2wd version with 275/17 tires even takes curves well.  It is not a sports car, but you don't have to baby it around turns like you do with most trucks.  It is not &quot;tippy&quot; at all.  Very stable and you feel confident driving it. 

Styling is subjective, but with the flareside bed and big tires, this truck really gets looks.  It has an aggressive stance that most trucks can't match, and the smooth lines are best appreciated with the big tire setup.  

Comfort was the only significant problem with the Ford.  We found the seats bizarrely hard after about 10 minutes of driving, and could never seem to find a comfortable driving position.  For my build (34&quot; inseam), when my legs felt comfortable, I couldn't reach the wheel.  I like to drive reclined a bit, so if you sit bolt upright, you may not have this problem.  A telescoping wheel is a MUST for future F-150's.  The seats have been softened some in recent models, so you will have to try them out yourself.  I have also heard of telescoping pedals as an option , which might help.

Ergonomics were fine, with good cupholders and radio buttons.   Everything worked like it should.   The cab was spacious, but there is not as much room behind the seat as the Ram for storage, though more than the Chevy Silverado has.   Seat materials were a bit velour-y for me, but those also have been upgraded somewhat.  

Quality was top notch.  The paint was better than average, though not up to import standards.   We drove this truck for 30,000 miles without any problems.  It never even needed brakes or tires, and it was used to tow a trailer for about 10,000 of those miles.  We only sold it because we wanted an extended cab truck for trips.

Resale was fantastic.   I kept it in pristine condition, and it sold quickly to the first looker for my asking price of $16,500.  I only had $20,900 in it, including sales tax.   That is less than some USED trucks depreciate.  Keep one for 5 years or more, and it becomes a real bargain. Because of their high volume, prices are reasonable, and discounts are plentiful. I paid only $200 over invoice.

With the STX package and it's lower-geared rear end, it really gets up and goes.  The 4.6L V-8 felt much quicker than our 5.9L equipped Dodge Ram.  There is a bit of engine noise and wind noise, but relatively low for a truck.   The new Toyota Tundra, however, is a much quieter and more refined vehicle.   Fuel economy was about 17 mpg in town, when used for commuting.  The stereo was adequate, though I would upgrade if I wanted audiophile quality sound.  

Other than the seats and seating position, it's hard to fault the F-150.  With the newer seats or even aftermarket seats, it might well be the top domestic truck, when you factor in performance and reliability.  They're not the #1 selling vehicle in America for nothing. 

Anyone looking for a good quality, affordable full sized truck should consider the F-150.  Prices do skyrocket with options, making your $20,000 well equipped vehicle approach $30,000, but for real work use or commuting, the regular cab 2wd models are hard to beat.
