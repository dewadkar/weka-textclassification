            After an exhaustive one year process, I determined that out of all of the $20-something thousand four door cars, the redesigned (A4) Golf GLS was the car for me.  My requirements: Four doors, good cargo capacity, high style, power &quot;everything&quot; (except seats), sunroof, durable (expect 5-7 years out of it), and--most importantly--fun to drive.

Driving the Golf is a kick.  Gas mileage isn't exceptional, but I blame myself... even with the standard 2.0L cylinder engine and automatic transmission, I can't help but take-off from stops, and gunning the engine any chance I can get.  Handling is crisp and tight, with a sporty ride that just swallows road irregularities.  Braking is quick, with the ABS kicking-in just enough to return control while remaining unobtrusive.  Put simply: After this, it will be tough to sway me from another German car.

The car also looks great--the finish and trim are above anything in its class, as evidenced by the recent (unsuccessful) attempts at cloning its formula--and the hatchback design lets it act like a mini sport utility.  The only drawbacks are a slight squeeze in the back seat if there are tall drivers in the front seats (but up front is remarkably spacious).  The only &quot;problem&quot; I've encountered is an intermittent and untraceable failure with the driver-side power lock switch.

This vehicle is excellent for someone who appreciates an excellent value, doesn't mind straying from the pack of compact sedan clones, and enjoys driving.<br><br>
