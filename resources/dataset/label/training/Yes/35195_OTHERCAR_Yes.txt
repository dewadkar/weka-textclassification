            We bought our 1992 Volvo 940GL in February of 1998 with 64k miles on it. It is now 40,000 miles later, and the only unscheduled repair has been a relay. 

We bought this vehicle because my previous Mazda was totalled. I had
owned VW's and wanted another European car. I love the feel of the car, the seats, the options, the safety and the reliability. It is very stable on the road, though not terribly fast with the 4 cylinder. The automatic
transmission is very well mated with the engine, and I typically prefer
standards. 

The fact that it is rear-drive usually means you can get it inexpensive used. Everybody wants FWD (at least in the Northeast). I have mud/snow tires on it and it is fine in all weather. The limited slip differential is helpful. In non-wintery weather (the other 98% of the year), the RWD is
in my opinion, more desirable than the FWD. Your mileage may vary.

I work on my own cars, and this car is so easy to repair, it is a crime to pay the dealership. this is all a result of the rear-wheel drive set up which reduces the clutter in the engine compartment. The only thing that I had the dealership do is the timing belt, which cost $150. I didn't know that I could get into and out of any dealership for that price.

The car is very roomy inside, though noisier than my Audi. In fact, whenever I drive it right after driving the Audi, I am constantly looking to see if a window is cracked open. It isn't obtrusive.

Parts can be expensive if you go to the dealership. I have to do front brakes on it now. The rotors cost about $70 each and the pads are about $30. Those are non-dealership prices. It will take me about an hour to do the work, which would cot $500 at the dealership. 

My position on cars is simple. If you want a higher-level European car, you either need to turn a wrench yourself or find an independent machanic that you can trust. The parts are way to expensive to have a dealership trying different solutions and billing you for everything, whether it works or not. 

I would recommend this car to almost anyone that is cmfortable with the potential financial liability of ownership. The parts/maintenance are slightly higher than my old VW, and considerably lower than my Audi is, or a BMW, Mercedes would be. This car is great for families and is very safe and roomy. <br><br>
