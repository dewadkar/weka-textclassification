            The Firebird has been around since the late 1960s. Through the early 70's it was Pontiac's main if not only musclecar. 
Back in 1969, there was only one color option for the debut of the Trans Am, which was the white with dual blue stripe which has subsequently been used for special anniversary editions.
The 30th anniversary edition is no exception, and it utilizes the Firebird's WS6 performance package with 320HP from a 5.7 liter V8 powerhouse. The look and the sound of this car will get most passers' by attention. The car's curves are something to be admired by powercar lovers. The aggressive look includes wide rear fenders, large rear spoiler, mean-looking front nose and featured RAM-Air hood intake which makes it look like a heavy breathing machine. The blue stripes end on the front above the &quot;nostrils&quot; of the breather-look, and there's a fire bird (literally) at the end of each stripe. The highly-polished 17-inch allow wheels are specially tinted blue, an anniversary-version exclusive. The entire style of the car is as politically INcorrect as you can ask for, which is fine by me.
On the inside you'll find 30th anniversary logos on the specially colored leather upholstery and a unique serial number for each of these limited production cars. The seats are roomy and comfortable, the Monsoon audio system rocks, you can expect tilt wheel steering, ABS, dual airbags, air conditioning, traction control, the works essentially as far as options. The rear seat is small, as would be expected by those familiar with the Firebird/Trans Am. luggage, groceries, etc. fit easily and a person can actually fit inside the rear seat. A security system is included as well.
When it comes time to actually drive, this monster has impressive cornering and stopping abilities, plus great acceleration. It feels firm, it sticks steadfast to mostly any surface with its Z-rated Goodyear Eagles.
As stated above, the powerhouse engine is rated at 320 stallions and 335 ft/lb of torque. Around town it's light and nimble, but step firm on the accelerator on the freeway, and the firebird of power is awakened from its sleep to breathe some serious flames into the competition as you're pushed back into your seat, the monster inhales, and there's just a fierce growl coming out of the dual exhaust.
Truly &quot;the muscle car lives&quot; as the advertisements say, but speculation as to the future of GM's F-Body (including Firebird and Camaro) is making many nervous. The profit margin of the F-Body is one of the lowest among GM's offerings. We'll have to wait and see if there is a 5th generation.
Until then, keep driving.....<br><br>
