            We bought this minivan when I was pregnant with our first baby back in Feb 1999.  
I really love it for travelling there is a lot of room.  Ours has the removable back seat too.  Lots of leg room &amp; a large cooler fits perfect sideways just inside the sliding side door.  Great for travelling with a small baby/child.
The thing I dislike about it is that ours in a 1995 &amp; there has been several recalls on it.  But they have been fixed by the Ford with no charge to us which is nice.  We did have to fix one thing ourselves because we didnt get the recall til months later &amp; we are now waiting to see if Ford will really refund the cost like they say they will.
All in all its a great van.
It drives &amp; rides very smooth, very quiet too.
Anyone that does a lot of travelling especially with small children should buy this van.  It will seat 7 comfortably.  Or if you take out the quick and easy to remove, removable back seat it will seat 4 comfortably &amp; a very very large dog kennel.  There is tons of storeage space once you remove the backseat. Both back seats also fold down very easily for transporting large items.
