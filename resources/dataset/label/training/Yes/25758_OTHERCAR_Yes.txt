            I bought a 1999 Yellow Volkswagen Beetle, the GLS model, a little over a year ago.  I love my beetle because the gas mileage is good, the stereo system is awesome, the car is very safe, and it is a good looking car, unlike so many other boring cars on the road today.  

This car has had absolutely no problems in the time I have owned it, and I love that maintenance is free for the first two years!  The Beetle has ample space inside, and is small enough outside to fit into small spaces.  However, it doesn't feel like a tiny car on the freeway.

I bought a front end cover (bra) for mine, which helps protect it from flying rocks on freeways, and makes it look even cooler.  Everywhere I go people ask me about this car, and I am always happy to tell them how wonderful it is.  

I have taken a few trips with it, and although the trunk is not huge, it fit most of my stuff (the rest I put in the back seat, or fold the seats down to make the trunk larger).  Test drive one and you will see how fun these cars really are!<br><br>
