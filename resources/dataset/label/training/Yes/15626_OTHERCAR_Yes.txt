            This camera is great. It has many different modes for you to use, for example, you can go into the well laid out menu driven system and select an e mail mode where the images are lower quality, but smaller in file size. Perfect for e mail! It has a very powerful zoom and is easy to work. The biggest downside to this product is the high price. If you can afford it, then go ahead, buy it. Otherwise, if you really want a digital camera buy one of the cheaper models. If you don't really need a digital camera, just go out and buy a good scanner.<br><br>
