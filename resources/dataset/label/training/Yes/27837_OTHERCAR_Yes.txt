            I have always dreamed of the day when I would have a BMW sports coupe and would get to a traffic light and this young kid in his lowered sports imitation would pull up next to me and race his engine and indicate his willingness to race. I would then casually eye the light and at the instant it turned green I would drop my foot on the accelerator and feel the burst of power as I leave the beffudled wannabe behind.

Well this car allows me the ability to live that simple dream while driving in comfort and style. I have had many cars but never one such as this where every part in the vehicle is carefully thought and placed in such a way as to provide a positive experience for the driver. Their is ample power, tremendous handling, and great style. I can not tell you the number of times after a fresh wash how many heads turn when your drive by. BMW spent a great deal of time and research listening to their customers and when they reengineered the 5 series it is highly evident that they listened to everything that people had to say. From full GPS to a passenger mirror that lowers to give you a curb view when backing up, this car has it all. 

And in the two years that I have driven mine, my only complaint was that the brake and rotors were not covered under the maint plan and cost me $500 to repair at 30,000 miles. However the feel of the leather seats as you take your place in the car, the solid and thick steering wheel, the power supply at any speed when you press on the accelerator, the cornering when you whip through a 20 mile an hour S turn at 55, and the sheer elegance, more than make up for the one repair bill that I have had. I have made one mistake with this vehicle, about 2 weeks ago I let my wife drive it for a week while I was driving. She does not want to give it back!!<br><br>
