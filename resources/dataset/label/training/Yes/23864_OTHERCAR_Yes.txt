            The Mercedes-Benz S-class for the year 1992 is one of the finest cars that money can buy. The 300SEL, 400SEL, and 500SEL sport respective engines - 3.0L in-line 6, 4.0L V-8, and 5.0L V-8. The 3 liter does the job, but the stronger V-8's move the enormous car much better. The quality of the interiors and ride of the SEL's are like no other car I have ever driven. The pure ease and enjoyment of the ride itself make me want to own one very badly. The double glassed windows and thick windshield make it the quietest car in the world. It's factory sound system puts to shame most other sound systems that can be purchased. This was the first year for the new style of the S-Class and boy, MB sure hit the mark on this one!<br><br>
