            This is my 2nd QX-4 in three years and the new engine is a major improvement. Reasonably powerful torquey engine gives the Q needed pick up and towing ability. The automatic is smooth and responds when asked to. The Q is now very responsive and gutsy. The new suspension mods provide a flatter cornering response and soak up road noise and bumps. 
The body is absolutely rigid-without flex. It never squeaks, rattles or moans.  Tires stay planted at all 4 corners. The 4X4 controls are conveniently placed on the dash. You can leave it in full auto 4X4 or manually control it. I like the fact that there is a 'safety' designed into the switch so that you cannot accidentally go into four wheel drive LOW position unless you deliberately wish to. The transfer case lever is right at hand adjacent to the console. Build quality is top rate and easily rivals my friend's Mercedes, in my opinion. Switchgear, handles, doors all give a very high quality feel. There is no cheap 'plastic' feel to anything as in so many other brands. Closing the door yields a solid vault like sound. The visibility is excellent and the fully automatic moonroof is a pleasure to operate and enjoy. 
The A/C (here in Arizona's 110 degree days) works very well and cools rapidly. When blowing at high speed fully directed at top level vents, the wind noise is high. Also, it is not a split temperature design but the climate control works flawlessly. The cockpit and dash layout is intelligent and logical. No more hidden buttons or quirky layouts. Infinity finally put in a radio that sounds great and also has a readout that is legible. There is a lovely analog clock in the dash center so everyone can see it. Radio controls and cruise control buttons are now mounted  on the wood covered steering wheel- nice and safe! The cruise has laser sensor system to slow down vehicle if you follow too close. The three front cup holders can acommodate most anything except the Arizona sized gigundo 128 oz. Desert Soda cups! The new HID lights are a blessing and do NOT blind on comming drivers. Reliability is a strong suit with this brand and I am very a very satisfied owner with no problems. Service at the dealer is professional and efficient. I expect that from Infiniti and appreciate it! I wish the seat (with memories) would move further back and lower. But at least it is extremely comfortable. 
My main gripe is that whereas the new engine is smooth and more powerful, it still gets only mediocre fuel mileage and requires higher octane grade. Fortunately, oil consumption is nil there are never any leaks anywhere. There is an excellent full coverage 60,000 mile 4 year factory warantee.
This is a very high quality SUV that will provide its owner with many years and miles of motoring capability, satisfaction and pleasure.
