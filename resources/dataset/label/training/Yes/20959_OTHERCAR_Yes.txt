            My father is a car dealer and when he heard of the new PT Crusier, he had to get one. We went to look at them, and what a sight they are. Their inside and outside are beautyifully done, making the car very unique. Even the windows are great!!! The buttons are on the floor in the back, so you are able to puch them with your foot.

When we drive around in the PT Crusier, everyone looks at us. Not many people have this car, because they are in such high demand. Everyone turns their head when they see this car going by. It is like you are in a movie. You expect guns to be attach to the car in an old ganster movie. 

This car is a great new look for the new age. You are able to have tail gate parties with the table that extends in the back and everything else that you could possibly want! It is great for the average soccer mom, to a teenager, to a movie star!! Everyone should get this car. It is veyr spacious and a great car for a very low price!!<br><br>
