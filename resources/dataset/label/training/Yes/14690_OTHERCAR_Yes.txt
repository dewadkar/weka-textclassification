            Too bad Plymouth already nabbed the Colt name years ago for series of mini-cars and wagons, because it would perfectly capture this Sube's personality. Instead, it is saddled with a name that conjures up logging trails or, worse, a tree scientist.

Names aside the Forester is a frisky little devil that is a nice little package once you get over it looking like a Ford Explorer that was left in the dryer too long. 

As all Sube's are built like tanks--and weigh only slightly less--the long-term buyer will be glad for the strong 165-hp motor, horizontally opposed 4-cylinder--which gives the Sube the most oomph in its class. Wiser still would be to mate it to a 5-sp manual tranny, and boom, you have quite the sporty little package.

The revs come up fast, but not harshly or with a whine. Steering is nice and tight with good feedback.

Visibility is good too, with lotsa glass and slightly higher than other Sube (or seemingly so) ride position. The short hood and flat rear make for easy parking.

Interior space is decent, but this is still a small chassis. Adults are not going to arrive happy after a long stint in the Forester's rear. Build-quality seems good, without annoying squeaks or yawning gaps in finishing materials.

The only hardcore complaint is a remote entry system which INSISTS the doors are not just unlocked but AJAR unless you use it each and every time you exit the vehicle.
