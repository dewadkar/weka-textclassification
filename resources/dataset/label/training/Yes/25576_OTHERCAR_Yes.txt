            My husband delivered this beautiful machine to me for on our 17th wedding anniversary.  It had a big red ribbon tied sitting on top!  This was obviously a wonderful surprise- if you have ever seen this car.  I have truly enjoyed the experience of driving this car.  You automatically look when you see this car on the road.  You also find yourself looking at your  reflection in windows!  To drive this car is to be one with the road.  You feel like you are gliding down the road.  The only problem I have had with this car is when it rains,it really pours in the top.  I do live in the south so fortunately it does not get that cold either.  It does tend to fog up inside when you try to use the heat- but they have considered this by putting heated seats in.  Single people should consider this a must have car!  Those with children- it's OK, but think very carefully before buying this one.<br><br>
