                 I have to laugh at some of my male friends' opinions that Jeeps are &quot;babe magnets.&quot; I am not kidding. I know at least three friends who bought them believing this to be the case.
     Now, here is the real funny part. The man I married owns a 1993 red Jeep Cherokee. This just happened to be the vehicle I wanted, and I certainly didn't want it to attract, uh, babes. So I found a guy who had one.
     No, that's not why I married him. However, now that I think about it, how he feels about his Jeep and how he has taken such fantastic care of it over the years, does say something about his character.
     I love driving his (our) Jeep Cherokee. It feels so powerful behind the wheel. I love the 4-wheel drive in the winter time. I love being able to look out &quot;over&quot; everyone else. I love when I get compliments (usually from other men, mind you) about what a great looking vehicle it is.
     My husband originally leased the Jeep when he got it in 1993. We have since purchased it outright, and I would do so again in a second. It is a great vehicle. I can't believe I'm driving a 7+ year old vehicle and proud of it. Never goes out of style.
     The only negative thing I can say about it is the gas mileage. It's pretty typical of the SUV's, which isn't great. We do take it to New York on our ski trips about six times per year. 
     Great long distance and comfortable vehicle and great for hauling lots of ski gear and taking your kid back to college for the school year. Fits lots in back. Plus we have the ski rack on top, which is great for both skis and hauling extra-big loads. There's nothing we can't strap on top.
     Bottom line - I highly recommend this (and newer) Jeep Cherokee models for its versatility, reliability, storage capacity (limited but functional) and, I guess, it's &quot;babe magnet-ability.&quot;
