                 I bought my Ford Focus exactly one year ago. It is model #ZX3 and it happened to be the only hatchback on the lot. I actually purchased the car for my wife who has never had a brand new car in all our forty years of marriage: she was thrilled! 
     The Focus came with a Zetec 4.25 engine that can get up and go. The car also came with 15&quot; wheels which makes it look sportier than those small cars riding the highways with 13 or 14&quot; wheels with an exhaust pipe as thin as a pencil. The Focus is designed for economy  and comfort, but Ford did not overlook style and speed with 130 horse power available at 5300 rpm.
     This two door Focus may look small on the outside but there is a surprising amount of room inside. My wife is 5'3&quot; tall so needless to say she has no trouble getting in or out. I am 6'3&quot; and I too have more than enough room behind the wheel and feel very comfortable but, I would not like to be the person sitting directly behind me. The passenger seat offers even more space and someone can comfortably sit behind me when I am a passenger.
     The Focus comes with fog lights and an instrument panel all easily accessible to the driver. I regret not getting power windows but, as I said, it was the only &quot;ZX3&quot; on the lot and I wanted to surprise my wife for Christmas. As a true prognosticator, I did not purchase the vehicle until December 22nd then had to rally the troops to have it ready by Christmas Eve.
     There are not too many things I can say about this auto in a negative manner. 
      It's hatch is extremely large and while I would not drive this auto across railroad tracks holding an open cup of coffee, as Ford does in their commercials, it is a very pleasant driving car that holds the road and corners without the hair on your neck standing up. The break system stops smoothly and quickly without giving you backlash. Unlike so many so called economy cars, when you press down on the accelerator, this baby does not hesitate, it means business.<br><br>
