            This car was my first new car and i fell in love with the looks. After a year lots of problems occurred.  The first problem was that the sunshade for my sunroof had grease marks on it and since it is gray and the stain is brown it is very noticeable.  The next problem that was noticed was that the hubs and rotor were rusting and it was not a small spot the whole hub rusted (i have also seen this problem on every other celica i have seen). Other problems i have encountered are many rattles, squeaks and leaking air noises through the door and windows.  These problems have been chronic and will persist.  Other problems i specifically have encountered are engine belt problems (squeaking) which was replaced and also multiple check engine lights which led to having my Engine Control Unit(ECU)being replaced. Another problem is the paint it can be very prone to chipping because of little rocks and pebbles hitting it(because of the cars low stance) The reason i keep this car is that it is beautiful and the power is very acceptable for a 1.8 liter engine.  The VVTL-I engine is awesome once it hits lift at (6,000 rpm) and i feel like i'm flying. The seats are very comfortable and it feels like being a fighter jet pilot in the cockpit styled cabin. Another plus is the Automatic Shifting with steering wheel mounted shift buttons. This feature allows the people who don't know how to drive a manual transmission enjoy a sports car. Even though most of the power is in the high end it is very practical for everyday drivers who want to look and feel good in their car.  If you sit in traffic like i do you should have fun dealing with the easy radio,light,Ac/Heat and wiper controls. The other features that add to the styling and feel of the car are the spoiler, projector beam headlights, Aluminum sport pedals and the Day time running lights. Ideal for only two people, the back seat is very uncomfortable for the normal size adult and head room in the rear is even more atrocious. This car is a thrill to have and drive, i have been complemented on the car on numerous occasions. Don't expect to be driving as fast as mustangs, or corvettes but know you have reliable speed.
