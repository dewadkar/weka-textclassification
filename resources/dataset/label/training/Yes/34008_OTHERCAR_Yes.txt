            I bought the 1996 Tacoma Xtracab because of Toyota's reputation for reliability and durability.  I've had this truck one year and so far it has performed very well.  One problem that I had was with the seatbelt retractor malfunctioning, which Toyota promptly fixed at no cost to me.  

The drive is smooth, due to the longer wheelbase, I'd guess.  I have the four-cylinder automatic and it has some kick to it.  I've driven a 1998 Camry and the interiors are similar as are the smooth, responsive driving characteristics.  

This truck isn't for all truck fans.  My 2WD four-banger in particular is designed for city and highway driving only.  It isn't designed to haul massive loads.  If you need heavy-duty work done, look at the Tundra.  The Tacoma is for light-duty work only, I believe, and it succeeds very well in this popular niche.  I'd recommend this truck to people who don't need to off-road (and I'm still discussing my experience with 2WD 4cyl) or haul/tow heavy items.  It rides like a Camry and does the basics.

Two of my friends bought brand new Tacomas based on driving mine, and now a third friend is considering buying one.  Plain and simple, a great little truck!
