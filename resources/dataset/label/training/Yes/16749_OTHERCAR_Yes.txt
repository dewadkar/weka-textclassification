             The 1999 Lincoln Town Car Signature series has some great things going for it. The styling is unequaled, in my opinion, and certainly far better than the equal Cadillac. The car we have has 43,000 miles and has been extremely dependable. We bought the car used with 22,000 miles and the computer registered an average mileage of 24.3 mpg. Quite impressive for a car of this size! The front seats are quite comfortable, but firm. The handling is quite crisp and precise. The ride is actually too firm, and could be a little softer. Interior room is very good, but is reduced from earlier models. Extremely large trunk. Engine power is also very good. Fit and finish is truly superb, as are the quality of materials.

 Among the areas that are in the not quite category are: front seat foot room is inadequate on the pass. side for anyone with large feet. The road noise level in the car is too high for as car in this price range, as far as I'm concerned, most of it coming from the Michelin tires. The rear seat is not as comfortable as the front. No under hood light on a car that retails for $44,000 ( this has been corrected on subsequent years). Because of the stylish and large rear bumper, access to the very large trunk is rather difficult at times.

 Overall the car is quite satisfactory even with the shortcomings noted.
