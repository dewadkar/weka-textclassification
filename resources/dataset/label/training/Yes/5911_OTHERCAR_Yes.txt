            I am an owner of a 1996 Isuzu Rodeo.  I purchased this when I was in college and therefore very poor.  I needed to get rid of my previous vehicle because of mechanical problems so needless to say I wanted a dependable vehicle with lots of room inside for my friends and me.  I shopped around and the best vehicle for my money in the SUV arena was the Isuzu Rodeo.  I now have over 60,000 miles on my Rodeo and I am still as happy with it as the day I bought it.  The reason why I chose a SUV over a car was that I liked the feeling of sitting up high and looking over the cars in front of me.  I also liked being able to take my Rodeo off road to go hunting or camping out in the desert or up in the mountains and not have to worry about ground clearance.  Another nice thing is that the Rodeo can tow up to 4,500 pounds and comes with a heavy duty cooling system as standard equipment so that your vehicle won't overheat towing over two tons up a steep incline.  That leads me to my next feature that I like about the Rodeo, the Power button.  Whenever I'm climbing up a steep incline or need that extra punch off the line I press the power button and it allows me to do an extra 1,000-RPM's in each gear before changing gears.  That's adds some serious torque and allows you to control when you need it and when you don't allowing you to conserve gasoline.  I can't complain about the gas mileage that I get from the Rodeo either.  I seem to get no less than 18 miles to the gallon no matter if I'm driving the bumper to bumper traffic of the LA freeways or if I'm doing 75 mph on I-10 between LA and Phoenix.

I added some things to my Rodeo that I am really glad that I did.  Each of these things I found that I could add-on after purchase, get a better deal and enjoy my Rodeo more.  The first thing that I did was to install tint on the windows and install a 6-disk changer.  The tint is great and really keeps Rodeo cool in the summer.  The 6-disk changer I had installed could be integrated into the existing stereo system, which saved me money, and I was able to keep the tape player as well.  Another nice thing about the Rodeo's stereo system is that the rear speakers are mounted on the roof of the Rodeo allowing for maximum cargo room and great sound right at head level.

For the money choose the Rodeo, new or used you won't go wrong.  The advantage of the new Rodeo's is that they come with a power train warranty that covers the vehicle up to 100,000 miles.  That's the best warranty available today and proves that Isuzu believes in its product and by the number of Rodeo's on the road today, it's easy to see that Americans believe in them too.
