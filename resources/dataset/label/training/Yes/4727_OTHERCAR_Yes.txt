            I first stepped foot in the digital camera realm with an Olympus C3000 that I purchased a few years back, and I can&#146t help but continuously compare my current A80 with it. I purchased both these digitals only after I had conducted intense research for almost a week prior, and I liked these cameras based on their specs and reviews, but I have learned that it&#146s also the little things that really make a camera what it is.

Some things I immediately liked about the A80 were the fast startup time compared to my old Olympus, and no lens cap to lose. It was also less bulky with no large protruding lens when turned off. One thing that might befuddle beginners is the somewhat cluttered mode dial on top, but for most everyday shooting, simply leaving it in Auto or P mode should be sufficient. At first I was skeptical of the other specific modes, such as for landscape or night shots, but by experimenting, I&#146ve discovered that this camera does take <i>very beautiful</i> night shots if done correctly, which simply cannot be achieved by a simple point-and-shoot. The overlap feature in panorama mode was also new to me, and I have found it to be extremely handy.

The swivel LCD is often criticized as being too small/fragile/useless, but to the contrary, I have found it to be indispensable. I, too, was shocked by its small size when I first got it, but you forget about this once you start using it because the image clarity is not compromised. I believe the smaller LCD also extends the camera&#146s life somewhat (I was impressed by this: A set of 1800 mAh NiMHs lasted me about 2 weeks of daily, casual shooting on one charge (more than 400 shots, normal and continuous)). It also surprised me how often I would use the swivel feature, and you can get really creative, such as for spur-of-the-moment self-shots with friends, when the camera is backed up to a wall, setting it up on a high ledge, pointing it out from a shelf, putting it on the ground, etc. The swivel mechanism does feel very sturdy for now, but I do wonder how it will fare 5 years from now, hopefully by which time Canon will introduce the A10000.

I like that the playback mode switch is separate from the other shooting modes and easily accessible with a single movement of the thumb, which is especially convenient after you&#146ve taken a picture and people around you are yelling, &#147Let me see it, let me see it!&#148 In the image playback mode, the incredible zoom and fast panning are a couple of those less-documented features that are above par, and the histogram is also a nifty feature.

A problem I have noticed is that the camera tends to wash out some things in certain situations, such as light filtering in through a window in the background or some white objects. Barrel distortion is a bit of a problem for me as well at the maximum resolution.  I have found that the AiAF does not always focus the way I would like it to, so I usually just turn that off when taking serious shots.

I have few design gripes, as the unit is solidly built and the ergonomics are about perfect for me. One complaint is that the rubber cover for the USB slot tends to get in the way and can be slightly annoying as this is used a lot. Another is that you need be careful of the wrist strap when closing the CF card door, as I closed it on the strap one time and nearly unhinged the entire door, but I learned after the first time, thankfully. The camera I got also rests a bit unevenly on the bottom, so that if I want to take a slow-shutter picture on a level surface instead of a tripod, I need to use the delay timer to prevent shaking.

I believe this camera is perfect for both beginners, especially beginners hoping to dive deeper into photography, and intermediate users like me. I can definitely see problems from an expert&#146s point of view, such as lack of a hotshoe or uncompressed format, but I feel like that is justified when you consider the price, and for those professional shots, it would probably be wiser for one to use a higher-end model anyway.
