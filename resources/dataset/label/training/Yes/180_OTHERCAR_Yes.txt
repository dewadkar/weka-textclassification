            We bought the 1998 4-Dr tracker new in the summer of 1998.

Features:

4WD
Anti-lock Brakes
Rear Wiper
Auto

No warranty issues, no dealer hassles.

Dislikes:

-Road like a small truck, but not as bad as a Jeep Wrangler.

-The little Engine that could - poor acceleration, but could keep things going down the road at 85 mph ( at 4000 rpm ) if there wasn't too steep a grade in the way.  

-Rear seats not removable ( without a wrench )

Likes:

+Load Capacity, I exceeded the factory spec by probably 800 lbs and loaded it up with paint, Pergo flooring and other supplies for a long road trip. Not much dip in the rear end and it actually road BETTER heavily loaded.

+Snow Navigation : never got stuck even in the really deep and wet stuff.  Also pulled well on ice with 4WD engaged and a little weight in the back.

+Off-road and dirt road handling : Easy driving in off-pavement conditions, good road feel and the engine performed well at lower speeds.   

We put on 85,000 miles in 4.5 years. Only serviced it with 3000 mile oil changes, air filters,  1 new set of tires at 75k and 1 coolant change. 

Then, this past winter, I conducted a black ice physics experiment and rolled it 3 times.  I was alone in the Tracker, early AM, motoring along at 75 mph, bright shiny morning with no hint of bad road conditions.  I hit some black, fog created ice and went into the ditch back-wards and sideways after spinning around. I slid for about 50' and then rolled it.

The vehicle held up surprisingly well.  It WAS totaled, but the passenger compartment was reasonable intact. The air bags did not go off.  This was good since I probably would have been injured worse from them going off. 

I walked away with only a few dings and a little bit stronger faith.

If all 4 seats were filled, would everyone have survived?  I think so, but the person in the passenger seat would have had to have been short or risk some head injury.  The back seat passengers would have been thrown around the same as myself, but given that everyone had their seatbelt on, the vehicle did it's job and protected it's passengers.

So, if you find a used Tracker, they are a good vehicle provided the specific vehicle has been serviced well and not had any infant mortality issues.  Would I buy one again?  Not for long road trips, but it's a great in-town SUV that won't suck your gas budget dry.

As far as the stereotypical roll over issues go,  hey, it's an SUV. They ALL will roll given the right conditions.  It's surviving that rollover that counts. I did.

So, poor Wacker, Rest in Peace, it was good knowing ya.
