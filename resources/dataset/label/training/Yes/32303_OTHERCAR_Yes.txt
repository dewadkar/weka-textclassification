            I am the proud owner of my second Sentra! I drove my first one well over 150,000 miles and can proudly say that I had only one breakdown (alternator)! I am a major commuter (4,000 miles a month) and have come to trust the Sentra. My second one only has 7,000 miles on it, but I'm looking forward to a long and happy relationship.

For a car of this size, I believe the Sentra has excellent response and maneuverability. I'm able to maintain perfect control as I dodge the insane drivers on the Oklahoma speedways. It handles well in heavy rain, and the front wheel drive keeps me on the road in the snow and ice. 

On the down side, the Sentra's lightweight body can be a little rough to handle in high winds. 

My favorite add-on options are the power windows and door locks. I've always been hesitant to have them in the past, but Nissan does a good job with their extras. The factory CD player is awesome. The audio experts in my family are very impressed with the sound quality. 

I plan to stick with my Sentra for a very long time!<br><br>
