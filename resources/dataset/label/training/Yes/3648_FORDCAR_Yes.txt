              Bigger doesn't have to mean slower. Especially in the case of the Ford Crown Victoria. 
  The Crown Victoria comes as a base, LX, or my personal favorite, the Police Interceptor. The Interceptor goes faster, and has heavier duty suspension and engine pieces. A beefed up alternator, high temperature hoses, a dual exhaust with an H-pipe, a computer chip allowing the powerful engine to get closer to reaching its full potential, and  145mph speedometer with certified calibration are some of the special features. You will be hard pressed to purchase one if you
  are not a law-enforcement agency, but it is possible.
  Every Crown offers great safety and performance at a reasonable price, so don�t feel left out if you cant get your hands on a police package car.
  The smooth and powerful modular 4.6 litre V-8 engine provides very impressive acceleration. With this car, everything is effortless. Hills, passing, and towing are barely noticeable. This car will spoil you, so don�t try to feel
  satisfied driving some smaller car with front wheel drive and a smaller engine after driving the Vic. You wont be satisfied!
  The rear wheel drive format  is a wonderful thing to drive. As any performance driver will tell you, it is superior in giving the skilled driver total control of a vehicle's handling. That is why it is the system of choice on squad cars and race cars.
  Do not be concerned about the rear wheel drive in the winter. The great weight of this car, combined with the power and the traction control system keep it going strong through snow. Placement of a few tubes of sand in the trunk is a requirement, of course, not that these take up any room. The trunk is so massive, that you could probably move all of your personal belongings with only 2 or three trips. (Minus furniture) I moved all mine in one! But I am a college student... The full size spare sits up on its own little shelf and barely takes up any space at all. Such items as a full-size house air conditioner, a snow shovel, and a tail gate off a Chevy S-10 fit in the trunk quite well. (its a long story...) Did I mention I can pull the front wheel off my bike and put it in the back seat?
  While the new traction control system may keep you out of trouble, I find it to be very intrusive. Rather then transferring power to a non-slipping wheel, the new system just cuts out power from the engine. Ford must have realized after designing the system that many drivers would not care for this because they included a shut off switch.
  Other then the great cargo space and the V-8 power, the Vic beats many sport-utes in strength because it has a huge frame under it. If you look underneath one, you�ll see the huge rails that look like they are part of a railroad bridge. Well, those are what support you and keep you safe. Many sport utes don�t even have a frame.
 These cars are built tough because they have to be. In many rural counties, Vics are used to pull stuck cars out of ditches and push stalled ones off the road. Who needs a tow truck? Not to mention that in order for
most police agencies to accept a type of vehicle, it has to pass strict standards set by the California Highway Patrol regarding acceleration, braking, strength, space, etc.
  Other then the traction control system, the only other complaint would be the new Mercury-style roof pillar. I preferred the sleeker, slimmer one on the older models that was easier to see out of. But I understand that it
  costs Ford a lot less to produce one body shell.
  For a sleek and classy alternative to a mini van that just might win a fight with most sport utilities, check out the Ford Crown Victoria.
