            2002 Toyota Camry 4 cyl. driving impressions:
9/12/01

Today I test drove (2) 2002 Camry's, both 4 cyl. auto trans.

1. Camry SE with no ABS brakes - noticed all the SE's on the lot were made in Japan. Felt great! Power was adequate for me (way more than my 1992 Camry 4 cyl.) The seats were comfortable, controls seemed logical and easy to use. No complaints. The extra stiffness in the suspension translated into better road feel, without being too stiff or punishing. Brakes felt fine. Air conditioning seemed slightly less frigid than my old '92, (new unit has the new environmentally friendly refrigerant) but still adequate. Want to test the climate control in cold weather to see if you can split, and have cold air on your face and warm on your feet. (Helps me stay awake.) I liked the car a lot, and think it is slightly more fun to drive than the 2002 Honda Accord EX.

2. Camry LE: This sample had ABS brakes, but otherwise was equipped similarly to the SE model. All the LE models I saw were made in the USA. Noticed the slightly less stiff suspension, seemed mushy in the turns compared to the SE. The brakes felt very odd to me, seemed to require way too much pedal travel to engage. I drove another LE without ABS, and the brakes felt the same. I wonder if this has something to do with the country of origin (different brake components?) Anybody else bothered by the brakes on the LE? Overall, I thought the car was good, about equal to the feel of the Honda Accord, but not as good as the new 2002 Nissan Altima or the Camry SE. The Altima has some major shortcomings (for me) that put it out of the running, even though it does drive nice. (Like the unavailable Daylight Running Lights (DRL) and cassette player, both standard on the Camrys.)
