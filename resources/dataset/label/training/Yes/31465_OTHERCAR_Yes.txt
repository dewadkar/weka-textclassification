            I bought this camera at Staples for $199. There was a promotion that included a free 32M memory card. It was easy to set up and there were no issues with the software on my Windows ME system. But the batteries were quickly depleted after about 70 pictures. The manual suggests not using the LCD screen to extent battery life. But that LCD screen in essential! I then went to Sam's club and bought a battery charger kit with 8 AA batteries for $20. Best investment you can make! You can put 4 in the charger while you are using the other 4 batteries and these last a long time.

I am a little disapointed in the picture quality in indoor shots. Most of my pictures have poor color balance and are washed out; especially if I use the flash. However, outdoor pictures are incredible!

The camera features red eye reduction but it doesn't really work on my Siamese cats with their blues eyes. It reduces red eye by pre-flashing to dilate the person's pupils, and then flashing a second time. However, the delay between flashes is long enough that they usually end up closing their eyes from the first flash giving me shots of people with their eyes closed!

I can fit 69 "medium setting" picutres on my 32M byte memory card. I bring my card to the local Walmart and they make 4x6 photos from it for 28 cents a pic. THese are on actual photo paper so photo lifetime isn't an issue as is with photos from a printer.
