            This may be the last production year of the Camaro and the folks at Chevy went all out to make sure this car will go out with a bang. The Camaro comes in several flavors, a 200 horse power V6 base model, the 315 horse power Z28.And if the stock Z28 isn't enough Chevy will send one to SLP engineering and they will turn the Z28 into a 325 horse power Super Sport. I chose the later with a cat back 3" exhaust option package which boosts the final pony count to 335.

This car is simply gorgeous, the sleek lines, 17" rims and hood scoop are the perfect mix of class and muscle.  From the day I drove this car off the lot other drivers have been rolling down their windows asking me about this car. Everything from how much it costs to how fast does it go. Well the answer to that last inquiry is very fast!

Equipped with an automatic transmission this car will do 0-60 in 5 seconds and will burn through the quarter mile in 13.5 seconds flat. You can't find too many cars capable of that feat straight from the showroom and most of those you can find cost more then twice the price of my Camaro SS. Even with my fairly heavy foot on the gas I am averaging better then 20 miles per gallon, my sticker claims 18 City and 24 Highway.  

For all you Mustang lovers out there don't bother trying to compete with this bad Chevy, only the Saleen 351 is capable of posting better times but one of those will set you back 58,000 my Camaro only cost 30,000. And if some punk in a tricked up Honda tries to race you at a light put the automatic transmission into 3rd, step on the gas, and watch as a Honda gets smaller in your rearview mirror.

The interior is perfect for 2 people to ride in comfort. The leather has a nice aroma to it and is quite soft and comfortable even on long road trips. There are two rear buckets seats in the back, but anyone sitting in those seats will be suffering from a sever lack of leg space. This is no family sedan, its a sports car. The removable T-Tops that came as an option with my car have a storage space in the trunk area. The rear seat folds down for additional cargo room. The stock 500 watt Monsoon stereo system provides good mid and high range sounds, but is lacking in the lower frequency bass department. I had to augment my sound system with a 12" orion subwoofer in a tube powered by a 400 watt amp to get the acoustic's just right.
