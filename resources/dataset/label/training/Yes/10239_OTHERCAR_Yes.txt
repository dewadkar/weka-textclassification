            Toyota, in my opinion, makes the best cars in the world for the money. I did quite a bit of research into the company and found out just how efficiently they run their company. The way Toyota solves problems in their vehicles is they have their engineers come up with a solution that solves the problem in a way that it could never possibly happen again. Toyota crashes more cars a year than almost any other car company and have more engineers working on each component of their cars than almost any other car company. When another car company wants to start producing a new car it takes an average of about two years to build the plant needed to produce that vehicle. When Toyota wants to produce a new car it takes them about two weeks to start productions. They are just very efficient. So when you buy a Toyota, you are buying a really well-made car. The RX 300 is one of the best SUV's on the road. It handles like a car, never rolls!! It's stunning to look at. It has power! It has all the luxuries of a lexus. It's roomy. The only real problem with it is that it uses more gas than a regular car, but if your in the market for buying an SUV, that is the price you will have to pay no matter which one you buy. You get the most for your money!!! It costs less than a Jeep Grand Cherokee. It's very reliable in all weather conditions. It has enough power to hitch almost anything. I highly recommend this SUV as probably the most you'll get in an SUV for the money.<br><br>
