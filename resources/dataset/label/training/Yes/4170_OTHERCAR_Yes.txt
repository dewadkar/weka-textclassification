            Having owned a large model GM car before, we found the Cadillac offered the size, ride and trunk space which we desired.  Many other GM models had been downsized too much for our satisfaction.  
  We also found the warranty to be one of the better ones offered and it is at a reasonable price.  I do think that I should have gotten the 75,000 mile warranty instead of the 60,000 as we find ourselves enjoying this car so much that we are driving more miles than we logged in our previous cars.  
  The Cadillac DeVille is especially comfortable on longer rides--we usually go at least 500 to 1000 miles when we take a trip.  We also find convenience in the easily accessible button actuators for the trunk and gas cap access. 
   The trunk is huge, which leads to one of the drawbacks.  The 'cargo net' is very helpful in restraining smaller purchases, but if anything gets to the rear of the trunk, it is difficult to reach without a step stool. 
   The acceleration and maintenance needs of the Northstar engine make it a pleasure to drive worry-free.
