            All Hail Olympus !  I had a feeling that this digital camera would be awesome when I purchased it, but I tell you, my feelings were more than justified when i printed out my first set of pictures.  I formerly had a Toshiba PDR-M-4, which I felt was a very good camera, but as I found out 6 months into use, rather shabbily constructed, hence the upgrade ( and what an upgrade it was )to the Olympus C3000Z.   Now, I can recite all the technical specs as my colleagues in other opinions have so eloquently  done,or I can focus on the realities this excellent camera presents. I prefer the realities !

 The realities are that your pictures will be crystal clear, full of life and color, and a pure joy to view when printed with a good photo printer. ( I prefer the Epson 870 and Epson Glossy or matte paper!)  If you're like me, you've taken hundreds of photos with 35mm SLR's and probably a digital camera or two.  But I'm here to tell you that this is one of the finest, if not THE finest, cameras I have ever owned.  The prints this camera produces will clearly make you say &quot; WOW !,&quot; and have your friends in absolute awe when you tell them it is digital.  

It is also relatively easy to use.  If you can read and comprehend, then this camera is a snap ! Just take the time initially to go thru the manual and you're off to a new level of photography that you've never imagined before.  Do I sound excited about the C3000 ? YOU BET I AM ! 

Now, I highly recommend the purchase of either a 32 or 64 megabyte Smartmedia card, because the 8 and 16MB sizes don't do this camera justice in light of the bevy of features this camera has. It will accept Smartmedia cards up to 64 MB as well. Remember, this is the same camera as the top of the line C3030 but without the DRAM buffer, which by the way is about $200 more.  Also invest in a battery charger and rechargable batteries.  Olympus, to my regret, only supplies a 8MB card and two lithium long life batteries with the camera, but what the heck, what's a few extra shekels when I've already spent $ 800.00 bucks ? 

Two final realities you may find of interest.....I absolutely love the USB connection for the C3000Z.  In comparison to my aforementioned Toshiba, the camera USB connection is a dream....no fuss, no muss, just connect and download.  Lastly, a strap for the lens cap would have been nice Olympus, but in deference to the quality and construction of this product, I won't hold that against you.....just remember folks to take the cap off when you turn the camera on, unless you like to hear the nasty sound of a zoom lens going nowhere....LOL !  Yes ladies and gentlemen, I've been there and I've done that.  Just put the cap in your pocket and start shooting.  In closing, the C3000Z is a DEFINITE five star buy....bought mine at QVC with 3 easy pay payments. Enjoy !!!!!      <br><br>
