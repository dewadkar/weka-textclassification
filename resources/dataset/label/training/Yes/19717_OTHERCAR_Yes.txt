            The 1999 SW2 is just a fabulous vehicle for the money.  It is very peppy and to date (14,000 miles) has been virtually trouble free.  Even our &quot;stripped down&quot; version comes with A/C, seats with comfort adjustments, a nice radio, and very well appointed interior.

The fuel economy is outstanding, about 35 mpg on the highway and around 30 in the city.  

What may be best about dealing with Saturn is you really feel like a customer with their dealerships (rather than a target like in some).  Their service department is the most friendly and efficient we have ever experienced, and this appears not to be by accident.<br><br>
