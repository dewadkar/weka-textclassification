            While it still may not be the most fun you can have in a family sedan (the new altima taks that one), then new Camry will remain the best selling car in america for a number of reasons.

The camry is reliable as the sun.  Americans have places to go and thnigs to do, and they don't need little reliability quirks in their family sedans slowing them down.  The camry has never done that to us.  Not many people can say they have been stranded on the side of the road with a broken down camry.  And by driving a new Camry SE I can verify that this thing is as solid as all the other camry's I've driven.

The big difference between this camry and others is that the new SE 4 cylender 5 speed is genuinly fun.  Although It's nowhere near the pure joy of rowing through the new altima's gears to the music of a 260 horsepower V6, it still goes down the road smoothly and sure footedly.  Driving the new camry reminds me much of a Mercedes.  It feels very solid and substantial going down the road, even though it isn't that heavy.  

I was surprised how well the 4 cylender put out the power.  When mated to the 5 speed manual transmission like in my test car, the camry scoots pretty quickly.  Since this dealer let me test drive it on my own, I was able to lay some nice tire patches down at some stop lights and had a good run with a kid in an Eclipse.  

Yet through all this hard driving, I was treated to a roomy interior, soft seats, a decent stereo, and very good sound insulation from the outside.  Also, the new camry's catlike exterior is impressive for a bread an butter sedan, although I do think it will grow old seeing so many of them.  

The camry's the same car as before, just with a fun twist.
