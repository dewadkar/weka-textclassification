            This is a solid non-geek, non-photographer's digital camera. The most impressive part of the ePhoto 780 is the ease of use; this will probably be passed down to my pre-teen brother when new technology beckons.

It's a joy to use; I haven't bought film since I got my hands on this. The purchase was inspired by a visiting friend's slightly more expensive digital camera. The 780 isn't feature-packed -- the most notable problem is that it lacks a zoom -- but the resolution is good enough that that hasn't been much of a problem. The resolution-for-price was a major selling point.

The design -- which see the pic -- is 'ergonomic' and will stand up to many hours of abuse in a purse filled with sharp objects; a sliding cover serves as both lens cap and off/on switch. It's small enough that it works well as a tourist camera, and almost disturbingly light. The casing has stood up to a great deal of abuse, though.

You can take anywhere from 12 to 96 pictures, depending on the resolution, before uploading. The upload process is a painless matter of plugging it in, and it comes with what I understand is pretty decent software -- if you're the sort who's inclined to play with your snaps. Most of mine haven't needed much, and I am an out-and-out lousy photographer. 

Odd side note: an on-line computer company scammed us and sent us two -- do not buy yours from buyitnowcomputers.com (feel free to check with the BBB, which is what I should have done) -- and we effortlessly disposed of the second: two friends both offered up cash after trying ours; they ended up going in on the purchase together. Neither are particularly technology or camera-oriented, so it bodes well for my view of the 780 as a non-photog, non-geek's digital camera.
