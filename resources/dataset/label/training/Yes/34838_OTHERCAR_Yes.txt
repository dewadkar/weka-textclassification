            I owned a Honda 96 Odyssey and loved it.  I had never imagined a minivan could have such a smooth ride and ease of handling.  I upgraded to a 99 EX Odyssey.BIG MISTAKE!  The power doors opened while driving twice (scary when you have young kids in the car) and frequently jammed. Once they jammed, you had no choice but to take it to the dealer for readjustment.  The doors were recalled TWICE, and I had to have them repaired an additional third time. 

 I gave up, cut my losses, and traded it in for an LX, 2000 odyssey.  Same great Honda car, smooth ride, ease of use, light feel, powerful engine, streamlined design, and NO POWER DOORS!  The manual sliding doors on the LX model work great, and are easy enough for my 6 year old to maneuver.  After a terrible experience, I took a leap of faith and stayed with Honda.  I am glad I did. 

 The LX doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the EX.  No roof rack, no cd player (these can be added to the LX) no power driver seat (do we really need a power driver seat?) and no traction control, (which only operates up to 20 MPH anyway.)But the peace of mind knowing that when I want a door open, I can open it, and when I want a door to shut, I can shut it, is worth much more than any extra Honda can give me. 

 Honda should never have stopped making a van that had four doors that open out(the 96 odyssey) instead of sliders, but since they did, they need to go back to work and make power doors that are foolproof.  Until then, no thank you.<br><br>
