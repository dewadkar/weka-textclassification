            If you've read any of my reviews at all, you probably know by now that I (and my spouse, too) am a cheapskate (economical, if you want to be nice about it).  So what made a couple of skinflints spring for a car that's not exactly cheap, and a brand-new one, at that?

The 'new' part is easy: Subaru made major improvements to the 2000 Outback, and we couldn't wait for them to hit the used car market.  So we cited all the justifications about how much less new cars depreciate than they used to, and in February, 2000, bought the first new car either of us had ever owned.

<b>Why we did it</b>
Our reasons for picking the Outback over other vehicles follow, along with assessments of how well it is fulfilling our expectations.

1.  We required room for our camping gear and family of four.  Short of a king-cab pickup, of course, we knew we weren't really going to get this.  A mini-van might actually fill this need a little better, if space were the only consideration.  We bought a roof pod instead, and have found the combination works very well.

2. We required decent gas mileage (this eliminated SUVs right off the bat).  Subaru claims the Outback will get something like 27 or 28 mpg on the highway, and 22 or 23 in the city.  <i>Consumer Reports</i> got more like 14 mpg in the city.  Our experience has been 25 to 27 on the highway (usually carrying the Pod), and 22 or 23 in the city.  We probably do a much more mixed city/highway sort of driving than that used in CR's tests (I believe they tested the automatic, while we bought a manual, which could make a difference); I can't answer for results in serious commuter-style stop-and-go traffic.  For fuel economy and cargo capacity, we'd have done better with the Volkswagon Passat, but. . . 

3.  We required a bit extra road clearance.  We like to take the road less traveled, or less travel-able, when on vacation.  Our old Mazda pickup set our minimum clearance limit (we put a dent in the gas tank once), and the Subaru has about an inch better clearance.  By the time we'd reached this point in our list, the Outback was about all that was left (except maybe the Forester, but the higher profile and reduced cargo space ruled that one out).

4.  All-wheel drive was appealing, if not essential.  Again, this is because of our penchant for dirt roads and barely-accessible trailheads.

5.  Safety features: dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, good visibility, decent handling, and good stability.  We've been used to anti-lock brakes, but most of the rest of these features were new for us.  The kids' car seats also fit well and securely, an important consideration as we have probably 7 or 8 more years of them ahead of us.

6.  Subaru's repair/reliability record is excellent.

7.  It's easy to handle in city driving and parking--since this will be our only car if we ever succeed in selling the pickup, I wanted something I could park in the city.  No vans or immense SUVs need apply.

<b>Our take on it so far</b>
On the whole, we are very happy with our vehicle choice.  We both find it very comfortable to drive, though a taller/larger person might feel a bit cramped.    We have learned to pack it effectively for camping trips, so that it is functional both on the road and in camp (this took some experimentation, but, then, so did the old pickup truck)  When fully loaded we may not be able to climb mountain passes at 70 mph, but we can do it at 55 or 60, which is about 20 mph faster than the truck.

<b>Some other features I like:</b>
--The adjustable-height seatbelts.  The front belts are on sliding adjusters, which allows me to position the belt comfortably.  Never before have I had a shoulder belt that didn't cut into my neck.
--The bin between the front seats allows us to keep more of the car-clutter corralled and out of sight.
--Small storage spaces in the back do the same.  I keep a first-aid kit, flashlight, and duct tape there at all times.
--Power-window locks keep the kids from rolling down their windows.
--Rubber mat in the cargo area is a carpet saver when we are hauling a wet and muddy baby-jogger around.

<b>Minor complaints include:</b>
--The cup-holders, while better than they used to be, are still flimsy and cannot hold a full-sized water bottle.  Rear cup-holders will be out of reach of the children until they are in their teens, I think, and are too flimsy to withstand kids anyway.
--A tendency of the windshield to fog up.  Maybe I just don't remember this in our previous vehicles, and maybe it's because it's been a damp, dank summer and fall.  Anyone else find they are running the defroster on cool but sunny days?
--Jamming that third adult into the back along with two car seats is not for the faint of heart or the wide of hip.  Probably our biggest problem with this car is that we cannot carry all four of us and two grandparents.  This would be true of any wagon, though.

<b>Would we do it again?</b>
Until someone comes up with a high-clearance, AWD, seats-six vehicle that costs about the same and gets even better gas mileage, yes.
