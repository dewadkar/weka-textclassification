             I just traded in my '98 Navigator for a '01 LX470.  One immediately notices the dramatic difference in quality.  This is not unexpected as the Lexus is priced more than 33% more than the Navigator.  The good things about the Navigator were it's ample cargo space, ease of removing the third row seat, and storage spaces for change, glasses, and odds and ends.  In these respects, Lexus could learn from Lincoln.  However, when it comes to quality, fit and finish, and performance, both on and off the road, Lexus wins hands down.  Not to mention safety!  There were more recalls on my Navigator than I can remember.  Including wheel lugs, TWICE!!!  More than a little scary.  I needed a vehicle that would carry 8 passengers.  There werenï¿½t many to choose from.  My experience with Lincoln dealership service departments wasn't great.  Lexus has the reputation of treating its customers like they value them.  So far so good.  By the way, the Mark Levinson sound system is extraordinary!  The best I have ever heard in an automobile.
