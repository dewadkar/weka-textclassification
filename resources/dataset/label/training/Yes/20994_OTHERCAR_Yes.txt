            My family purchased our RAV4 brand new in 1999.  We were forced to look for a new car when our old minivan died.  My stepfather looked around for a while and fell in love with the RAV4.  He really liked the gas mileage, the handling, and the overall looks of the car.  It was to be his, so what he liked, he got.

Since the RAV4 is my stepfather's car, I am primarily a passenger.  This is not a passenger-friendly automobile.  From the outside, the RAV4 appears to be a small SUV.  When one enters the car, though, they find differently.  The trunk shrinks, the ceiling drops, the seats move forward, and the walls move inward.  Soon, the only person with any amount of space is the driver.  It all causes for the ride to become an uncomfortable and embittering experience for the passenger.  That's without any cargo in the car.

On the other hand, the car seems to be wonderful for the driver.  There is plenty of room for the driver.  The RAV4 gets excellent gas mileage, and the steering is great.  The appearance of the car is appealing enough to warrant a second glance.

If you and your family are looking for a car, take a look at the RAV4.  That is, only if you are the one who plans to do most of the driving.  If you are to be a passenger, I suggest that you attempt to discourage the purchase of this vehicle.  The overall summary is - good for drivers, bad for passengers.<br><br>
