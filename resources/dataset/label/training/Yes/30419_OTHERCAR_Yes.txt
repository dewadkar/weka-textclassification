            I first set foot in one of these amazing cars and was instantly struck by how much I liked it.  The car that I have has all the options, including automated head rests, heated rear seats, and much more.  This car is amazing!  I bought this car because it was rated very highly in the collision testing and it was reasonably priced.  It's a good buy.<br>There are a lot of things that I love about this car, and few things that I don't like.  First of all, I love the interior of the car.  It is well designed and spacious; you can even stretch out in the back seat!  In the winter time in the rear seats, you can always turn on the seat heaters and enjoy a warm ride around town.  This is one of my favorite options.  The front seats are even better, though.  The consol of the car is very well crafted and designed.  The radio is easy to use and has up to 10 presets for radio stations.  also, everything in the front seat is automated, from the head rests, to the windows and mirrors.  At the touch of a button, I can make my seat move, change to my favorite radio station, adjust the steering wheel location and more.<br><br>This car is amazing to drive as well.  The pick up in this car is incredible.  Every time, i get a rush as i am pushed to the back of my seat.  Also, the handling is great.  At the slightest touch of the steering wheel, the car instantly responds and turns the car.  Lastly, this is one of the highest safety rated cars that I have driven.  I think that this is the car for families who care about their childrens safety.  It's a great car, and even better for a family<br><br><br>
