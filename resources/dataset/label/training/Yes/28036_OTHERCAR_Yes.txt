            The 2000 Plymouth Neon is the best ever Neon made.  Although the 3 speed auto-tranny engine is the cheapest engine in the market, the comfort and handling of the car is excellent.  I bought this vehicle because of the price.  

I was thinking of getting a Honda Civic, but I picked the Neon for the price and comfort.  The engine of the Neon still makes a bit of noise, but I think all engines should make noises.  Anyways, all you have to do to get rid of the noise is turn up the volume of the music.  The Neon has a pretty nice sound system.  

My friends and I were amazed at it's quality for just a manufacturer's sound system.  Since the engine is a 3 speed auto-tranny, the engine lags in speed and changes gears slower than most automatic's.  The handling of the car is very nice, but like most compact car's, the steering wheel is loose on turns, not like that of sport car's.  

People who don't care about a little engine noise, need a cheap car, and want comfort should buy this car.  This car should not be bought by people who travel long distances frequently, because of the engine noise, and that previous neon's had problems with their engines at about 60,000 miles.  The 2000 neon will soon be seen, if Plymouth has fixed the problem.<br><br>
