            I bought an Xterra SE 4x4 earlier this year, and I am completely happy with it.  I haven't had any problems as of yet, except that the high price of gas is kind of painful when you only get about 15 MPG.  Then again, your mileage may, quite literally, vary.  I drive city streets like a bat out of hell...

Magazine reviews that I've read said that the Xterra handles like a truck.  This is true, but it's not necessarily bad.  I happen to like trucks.  Unlike the latest crop of so-called SUVs, the Xterra is actually built on a truck chassis, so it has more in common with a truck than do these large cars that claim to be SUVs.  Buy an Xterra, take it out and play around in the mud and dirt, and you'll see a clear difference.

I especially like the fact that there are several online communities made up of other people that love their Xterras.  Take for instance &lt;a href= http://www.insidetheweb.com/mbs.cgi/mb428752 &gt;The Unofficial Nissan Xterra Message Board&lt;/a&gt; or Nissan's official Xterra site.  These sites are great, because you can read about other people's experiences with their vehicles.  Before I bought mine I read through some of the bulletin boards to see what problems people were having and how they were using their Xterras.

BTW, if you want to buy any of the accessories don't bother with the dealership.  You can find the exact same accessories at &lt;a href= http://www.xterrastore.com &gt;www.xterrastore.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href= http://www.xterraparts.com &gt;www.xterraparts.com&lt;/a&gt; for much less.  My dealer wanted $200 for the interior bike rack, and I bought the same Nissan product online for $150.

Speaking of dealer gouging - don't let them charge you a &quot;market demand&quot; fee.  I don't know if they are still doing this, but when I bought mine they wanted me to pay $2500 above and beyond the sticker price because the Xterra was so popular.  I talked them out of it, but it didn't give me much room to bargain on the sticker price.<br><br>
