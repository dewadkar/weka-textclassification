            Kodak and pictures are like salt and pepper. So you would assume that any camera made my Kodak would be sufficient. Well let us take a look at this one and see if it will suit your needs.  This is a very inexpensive camera, with point and shoot attributes.  


The <b>Kodak DC3200</b> is an entry level camera, that only has a few great quality features that makes this one stand out from the rest. For one the The quality of pictures lacked on some areas.  One being the focus and two being the colors. They just were as vibrant as I had seen on some other cameras.  You wouldn't expect this from any Kodak.  When prints are done you will notice that the 5 x 7 prints are the best. I didn't like the idea that these were the only ones that were best. I like variety, and so do you.  


<b>The resolutions</b> can be 1,152 x 864 pixels and 576 x 432 in best, better and good quality settings.  You get 2 MB of internal memory, this is not much, but the price stays within reason by doing this.  You can only store 22 shots with this memory, so make sure you know if this is what you will need or do you need more. Most likely more.  You will find the card slot at the bottom of the camera for inserting an optional <i>CompactFlash Card</i>.  You will also notice this camera does not have the typical metal outer casing as some nicer cameras, this one has a plastic casing.  This too helped Kodak to keep the price down.


You get 5.4mm fixed focus lens (equivalent to a 39mm lens on a 35mm camera) that focuses 2 feet to infinity.  Very good integrated flash and 2x digital zoom, but no optical zoom abilities.  Your serial connection is very slow on this camera, it does not offer USB (universal serial bus) connection.  I personally would rather have the USB with any camera, just for the speed alone. 


<b>Manual settings</b> are good, not great. They are limited to switching between daylight, fluorescent, and tungsten white balance settings. 

<b>More good</b> about the camera is the 1.6inch LCD (liquid-crystal display) that is included.  Offers great manageability using the camera.  Batteries are rechargeable, although they didn't last long.  If you choose this camera, get yourself a better quality of battery.  There is an optical viewfinder above the LCD and a lever to move from <I>play</I> and <I>camera</I> functions. As well as buttons for menu, flash, and select. 


<b>Overall</b> the camera is a nice size, fits into the shirt pocket, design is nice and stylish, and the lens and LCD are located on the side of the camera that gives the user more room for left hand support.  For a camera under $200 is has its limitations, and flaws.  But it still is a nice camera for the user because it is an easy camera to use and operate. New users should not be intimidated by using this camera, and it is a great one for beginners and for email as well.
