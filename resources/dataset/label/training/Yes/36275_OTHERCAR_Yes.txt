                 I got this car because I was looking for something reasonably priced and dependable.  I have had the car since June 1998.  The car has had to only have major work on it because I hydroplaned on slick roads.  The car did well and did not flip over during the accident like most cars do in cases like that.  
     The car does well on road trips.  The seats are moderately comfortable.  You might think when you look in the back seat that the seats are cramped, but when you sit in them they are not. The seat angles downward slightly were you have a comfortable ride.  Long legged people are the only ones that will have trouble with the front seats and might have a little feeling of being cramped.  
     My car gets a lot of mileage on it because it gets me back and forth to school.  I am comfortable with the ride.  The only problem I have with the car is the amount of road noise heard on the inside from the drivers seat.  You get used to it and it is not really bad.  
     I recommend this car because of the reputation Toyota has and the way my car has performed.<br><br>
