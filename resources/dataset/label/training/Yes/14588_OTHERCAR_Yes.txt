            This car is made so well and so roomy that nobody else in the auto industry can beat the quality and the price,along with all the features which are all just part of the package with this car.I personally would never even consider owning anything other than a Honda Accord.It has plenty of room ,it's very fun to drive and reliable all the time.It requires very little attention (maintenance) and so you save money in more ways than one with this great auto.Even on very distant trips I've taken this car has outlasted anything I've ever owned and used very little gas.The overall comfort is fantastic and I had no complaints from anyone not having enough of room. Not to mention I stopped more often to get snacks than to get gas for this car.There were a few knocks it seemed when I first got the car but the older this thing gts the better the gas and the love of owning it!<br><br>
