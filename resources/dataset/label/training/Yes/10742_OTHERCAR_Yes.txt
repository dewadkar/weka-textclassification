            I have been wanting an SUV for awhile and as soon as I saw the Tribute I had to have it.  I have been driving the Tribute DX-V6 for about a month now and out of any of the cars I've had nothing compares to the Tribute.  It is a smooth ride with great pick up.  It has a great stereo system with CD.  We have already taken it on a 10 hour road trip and realized how much space it has when I would have to just step to the back seat to take care of our toddler.  And what a great feeling it is to have someone come up to you and say &quot;Wow, what a nice truck, what is it?&quot;  I recommend this truck to anyone and everyone.<br><br>
