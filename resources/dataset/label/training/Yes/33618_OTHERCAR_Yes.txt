            My lady friend purchased a new 1992 Cadillac Sedan DeVille to replace her aging 1984 Seville. Eight years later the car is holding up extremely well and still looks like a brand-new car. She drives 24 miles one way to work every day, but you wouldn't know it by looking at this beautiful vehicle. It's finished in a striking Medium Garnet Red Metallic which inspired me to order my 1994 Deville in the similarly stunning Carmine Red Metallic. 

It has a dark red leather interior and features genuine maple wood trim on the dashboard. It is powered by Cadillac's venerable 4.9 litre engine which rapidly propels this vehicle from 0 to 60. It also features the upgraded cast-aluminum wheels and Michelin white sidewall tires. It has a cavernous trunk with a low lift-over and get this ... a full-sized spare!

The 1992 DeVille's styling is a rehash of the new  smoother '89 restyling which added  a much needed 4&quot; of length to the too small 1985-88 body shell. The new grille is somewhat reminiscent of the gorgeous 1969 Caddy. Cadillac's 1989 restyling of its FWD models vastly improved the looks of the car. The 85-88 FWD models were small, boxy-looking, un-Cadillac-like vehicles with styling elements that look great on a bigger car, but stupid on a smaller one. The coupes were particularly awful - not really coupes at all, but rather 2-door sedans. If Cadillacs remained the way they were in 1985-88, I would've deserted the marque for Mercedes or Lincoln. 

My lady friend's car, like my '94, doesn't have the vinyl roof treatment and looks much better without it. Dealers should avoid offering those dreadful aftermarket &quot;Roadster&quot; tops to these cars as well. They are as tacky as those funky &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot; grilles and gold packages. They certainly do nothing but degrade Cadillac's image. 

Although the 1989- 1993 Cadillac's appearance was a vast improvement over what came before, it styling was still pretty boxy with it's slab-sided appearance and nearly bolt-upright C-pillars and backlight. The dashboard also suffers from the same boxy corporate GM-look of the period. The center of the steering wheel housing the airbag has all the panache of a Kleenex box mounted on the hub. To summarize, the '92 DeVille looks like the box the '94 came in. 

The centers of the aluminum wheels are also susceptible to theft and cost $51.00 each to replace. I don't know what can be done to prevent this theft, for I see all kinds of cars missing the wheel centers. You'd think car makers would think of a way to thwart this. 

Aside from this, the 1992 Cadillac has served her well for nearly a decade and still looks good. She tends to keep her cars for a very long time and I will probably still see this car for another decade, (she also has a 1981 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight which she also uses regularly). A 1992 Caddy can be had for a reasonable price today and would make an excellent used car purchase - a mink coat at a muskrat price!<br><br>
