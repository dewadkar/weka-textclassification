            I've wanted a Mustang Convertible (is there any other way to make a Mustang?) since '94 when the fourth generation body came out.  In '99, when they changed it again, I was absolutely IN LOVE.

Well, I finally drove my '00 Mustang GT Convertible (Amazon Green, with Parchment roof &amp; interior) off the lot on August 24, 2000, and I've been infatuated ever since; I'm a convertible addict.

I needed a car with space for friends, so any two-seaters were out.  I also didn't want a car that would be really low to the ground; my ex-boyfriend has a corvette, and it was annoying to have to haul myself in and out of his car.  Also, he's constantly worrying about bottoming out on driveways &amp; potholes, and driving over puddles.  Because of the Mustang's height, none of this is an issue.

The car's got some serious pickup, and I love the handling.  I got it with every option available, including the 17&quot; wheels &amp; performance tires, and getting on the open highway is a blast.

I've driven the car from New Jersey to Boston and back, and the trip was a joy; although the trunk is small, it was big enough for a weekend bag, and if one other person had been with me, there'd always be the back seat.

It's not a family car, but it's not meant to be.

The gas mileage isn't as bad as I thought it'd be - about 20 on the highway - and even with the higher gas prices, it's absolutely worth it.<br><br>
