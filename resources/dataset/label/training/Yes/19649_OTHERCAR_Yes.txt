            I'm alive today because of my Saturn.  This car honestly saved my life.  
I was in a car accident and it was quite a horrible one.  To make a long story short, there were police officiers wanting their other halves to drive Saturns.

I went and bought another one.  The price was good and I feel safe in my car.

I think it should have come in more color choices though.  I wanted purple but I settled for Silver Plum.  People say it is brown and that angers me.

Overall I love my car.  You can't beat the price with all the options.  They know have the L Series and a small version of the minivan.  I hope to trade in in a few years for the L Series.  It's more roomy for my children.
