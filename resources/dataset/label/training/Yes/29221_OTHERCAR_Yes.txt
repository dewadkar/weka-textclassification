            As the owner of a Lincoln Town Car and previous owner of six others as well as a Lincoln Mark VII I feel very qualified to review this product. I think it is obvious that I have been happy with my Lincoln autos. I had one that was driven over 200,000 miles and another that I drove over 140,000 miles. I have been a homemaker and stay home mom for 38 years and driven many children many places without automobile problems. My Lincoln cars have given me excellent performance on the road. When I have children in school I loved being able to pick up my kids and other kids and still have a huge trunk full of groceries or whatever and never feel crowded. Of course nothing is totally perfect. The one problem I have had with some---not all of my Lincoln autos, was the electrical system. I have had to have several motors replaced on electric windows--not an inexpensive repair.However, this seemed to be more common in the 1960's 1970's and early 1980's. I feel that the last two Lincoln Town cars I had were improved in this area. I was very disappointed in the inside door covering of my 1989 Lincoln Town Car. I traded the car when it had merely 50,000 miles and the door panels were both cracking and peeling. I am not sure if it was just a bad year or if my car got a bad run of material, but it was in pretty bad shape. I am now fifty six years old and do not drive children around constantly so my cars do not have so many miles and last longer. I drive a 1993 Lincoln Town Car that has 65,000 miles and I just love it. Any problems I have had through the years can never make me change my mind about Lincoln Town Cars. I have had a Chevrolet, two Pontiac autos and one just awful Buick Station Wagon and have been stranded in all of them on side of the road with small children and in terrible places and more than once--the Buick was absolutely a nightmare! So I say YES BUY A LINCOLN AND BE COMFORTABLE AND SAFE!! I was told several years that in all car crashes that less fatalities occur in Lincoln Town Cars than in any other car. The statistics may have changed by now. But I love mine and will buy another without a doubt. Mary Dodd, 305 Valley Drive, Rockwall, Texas 75087<br><br>
