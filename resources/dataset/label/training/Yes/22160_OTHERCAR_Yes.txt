            This is more a tribute to my old car than it is a recommendation.  I would never recommend anyone go out and buy a 1988 car (mine wasn't a '90) given that it is 2001, but I really loved this car.  Its recent series of expensive repairs were the only thing I had against it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<b>The Scene</b>

The year was 1995, it was October.  I had been driving a 1980 Chevy truck that went through fifty dollars of gas per week.  Previously I had gotten into an accident that totalled my mother's Chevy Station Wagon.

My stepfather, in an uncharacteristically sweet gesture, decided to find me a cheap used car so he could have his truck back and save me some gas money.  What I came home to one day disappointed me.  Keep in mind I was about to be seventeen years old, and lived in a rich town. I desperately wanted a "cute" car more than anything.  A little red Neon would have been perfect.  Up until this point there had been nothing more humiliating than trying to park an '80 Chevy truck held together with baling twine between a Lexus and a Jaguar on the High School parking lot.

I realize now that being disappointed in his choice of car was extremely shallow of me, but at Seventeen, I almost couldn't help the response.  The need to fit in and be cool was so overwhelming it was like a biological necessity.  But I grinned, and I made do with what I had. After all, the big white Buick was much better than the old brown monster I had been driving.

<b>Change of Heart</b>

Soon I discovered that despite the car's "grandma" appearance, it was a joy to drive. Maybe I had little basis for comparison, given my short driving experience, but I started having so much fun driving this car that it was unbelievable.  I began to see those "cute" little cars being driven by "cute" girls as obstacles... or even roadkill...

<i>I can drive OVER you!  OUTTA MY WAY! I am bigger than you!!! bwaaahahahahaaaaaa!!!!!!</i>

The fun never ended.  The stereo system was light years ahead of what I was used to.  The dash display was like something out of the future.  I could change my display to metric and fool people into thinking we were travelling over 100 mph- endless fun for the easily amused.  

But the raw power of this car had me hooked, especially after I drove some newer four cylinder models that just didn't have the attitude to match my Regal.

I brought the car to college in Baltimore, and it made so many trips between Connecticut and Maryland it was a real wonder to everyone that the car did not fall apart.  It made two trips to Florida.  It was the quintessential road trip vehicle- tons of cargo room, with plenty of leg room, and an ability to cruise at a wonderful fast pace (and it got 30 MPG, who knew?).  I passed all those cute blondes in sunglasses and let 'em eat my dust.  <b>WUSSIES!!!!</b>

<b>Durability</b>

The same month my stepfather purchased the Regal, the family invested in a new Lumina for my mother, since her car was gone.  It was nice, and I was initially jealous.  But that soon faded, as we found that the Regal was <i>more</i> trouble free than the brand new Lumina.  Imagine a 1988-built car costing less than a brand new model to maintain. It was mind boggling.

Just this year (2001) the Regal started having major repair problems (though even with MAJOR repairs, mom's new car had still caused more problems than this old-school American beast). I suppose it was to be expected, and I stuck with it as long as possible, but eventually the bills got to be too much on my entry-level salary and I had to buy something newer with less maintenance problem potential (and a warranty).  Retiring that Buick was painful.  That car had more personality than anything on the road today. It had power, punch, and was fun to drive.  That last trip up the New Jersey Turnpike was almost heart wrenching.  I had gotten completely attached to my old vehicle, and dropping it off at home was like leaving a beloved family pet at the vet's office to be put to sleep.  It was hard.  

I am now stuck in an anonymous white car, with half the get-up-and-go of my old friend.  The Air Conditioning works in the new car, but man I miss the punch of my old Regal. <i>sniff</i>

<b>Specs</b>

For those who are interested, the '88 model had a 2.8 liter V-6 Engine, A/C, tilt wheel, disc brakes, stereo options, huge trunk, and lots os zoom.

Air bags?  <b>HA!  I LAUGH AT AIR BAGS!!!!</b>  (being bigger than most new cars, never felt unsafe)

God I miss that car.
