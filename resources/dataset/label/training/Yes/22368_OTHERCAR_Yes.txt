            Had this toy for 2 months now.  Makes my commute a joy ride everytime.  It's a very smooth ride, but you can still feel the enough of the road for the "speed racer" in you.  Only draw  back is that people speed up to get a better gleams of the car, but that's just more fun when you tap slightly on the paddle and leave them in your wake. Top down driving is a blast on this.  Even in chill nothern CA weather, it feels comfortable with the top down.  Some times I swear this baby drives itself!  It's an expensive toy, but hey it's worth it.
