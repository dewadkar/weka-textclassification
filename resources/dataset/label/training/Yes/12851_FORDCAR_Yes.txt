<b> <i>The Ford Explorer first introduced in 1991</b> </i> has been one of the top selling SUV�s in the market.  For 2002 the Ford Explorer has been rather dramatically redesigned.  There is more room, it is bigger, more comfortable, and a new independent rear suspension and many more new features that will be explored through out this review.

<b> <i>One important new feature is the bumper height has been lowered full two inches.</b> </i>  It�s kind of nice from a safety point of view to have bumpers that match up with the majority of other vehicles on the road.

<b> <i>Even though it has been lowered</b> </i> it is still a difficult vehicle to get in and out of.  The standard tubular step bar does make it easier to step up.  If this is an issue for you there is optional step sidebars ($336) .  The handles on the inside door pillars can really assist in getting up and  into the vehicle.


<b> <i>The new independent rear suspension has improved the ride</b> </i> of the Ford Explorer.   It is a bit of an unusual design where the rear drive shaft passes through a hole in the frame.  The rear wheels act independently making for a smoother ride on off road trails.  This new design has also allowed for better ground clearance without raising the step up into the driver�s seat at least not any worst than it was before.

<b> <i>Speaking of off roading I really like the push-button Auto Trac </b> </i>to switch into four-wheel-drive.  All button controls.    A nice feature is the 4x4 automatic feature that runs in four wheel drive but transfers power to the front wheels when the back wheels lose traction. 


<b> <i>The standard engine offered is a six-cylinder engine,</b> </i> with SOHC and 210 horsepower.  A V8 engine can be added as an option (cost $591). Both engines have a overhead-cam design.  The standard transmission is a 5 speed manual but an automatic is offered as an option. The V8 only comes with an automatic.

<b> <i>Since towing always must be taken into consideration for our family</b> </i> we found that the standard class 2 towing package has a capacity of 3,500 lbs. Optional class 3 and 4 towing packages on the V6 engine has a towing capacity of 5,500 lbs ($336).  If you must have more power and towing capacity the V8 engine with the towing upgrade can tow up to 7,000 lbs.

<b> <i>Safety features include a much smarter airbag system.</b> </i>  The air bags deploy knowing the severity of the accident, if the driver had his seat belt on or not and even knows the position of the driver.  The optional side airbags ($421) cover a full 75% of the side glass.  The side air bags work with a roll over sensor that judges how much of a tilt the vehicle has and deploys if a roll over accident occurs. Other standard safety features include the anti-lock brakes and an electronic brake force distribution.  Child safety locks have been installed


<b> <i>One feature my husband marveled over,</b> </i> (probably because of my lack of backing up ability) was the optional Reverse-Sensing system ($217).  This system detects when you�re backing too close to another vehicle or obstacle and beeps when you�re getting to close.  It beeps even faster the closer you get.  When you get way to close?  The tone becomes continuous.  Have you ever had the thrill of making a car salesman rather nervous checking out these wonderful new features?  Beep Beep.  Beep faster beep.  About 8 inches a way full tone!  I guess he turned funny colors because we were testing it out on the new Expedition!   

<b> <i>The interior is much more spacious than the 2001 model of the Explorer.</b> </i>  The quality of the interior looks much �richer� than the older models.  Many convenient features like the roomy storage tray in the lower console.  In the upper console is a really big storage bin.  There are a total of three drink holders.  There is a good sized map holder with built in bottle holders.  I always groan about map holders.  I like those map books with all the states and have always had to tuck it between the seat and the console.  Now there is a map holder big enough for it.

<b> <i>The visibility from the captain chairs was sensational.</b> </i> Full view from all sides.  It was one of the few vehicles that offers sensational visibility all down the sides and high out the front window.  The driver�s seat has a manual lumbar adjustment.  The lumbar adjustments are a wonderful feature on long trips.  The drivers seat offers ten full inches of change all powered by a button.

<b> <i>One feature I have truly learned to love</b> </i> is the optional power adjustable brakes and accelerator pedals.   My nephew�s Expedition has this and it is wonderful to be able to adjust the brake and accelerator pedals to your own comfort.
 
<b> <i>The second row of seats provides plenty of legroom and headroom.  </b> </i>  There is even a ventilation control for the back seat passengers.  Behind the passenger seats is 46 cu. ft. of cargo area.  There is also an option of having a third row of seats ($569). Both the backseat and front seat have 12-volt outlets.

<b> <i>To cover your cargo from view</b> </i> (handy during Christmas shopping) is a pull out covering pulls out from behind the rear seat.  You will also find 4 tie down hooks in the cargo area.  The rear windows have intermittent washer and wiper blades.  There is additional storage under the rear cargo floor.  

<b> <i>The rear lift gate,</b> </i> well actually it looks more like a hatch back now is lower.  It is much closer to shopping cart level than the old Explorers

<b> <i>The frame is much stiffer on the 2002 Explorer</b> </i> making it more stable in cornering and more responsive handling.  The wheel base is longer for a less bumpy ride.


<b> <i>The estimated miles per gallon</b> </i> are 15 city and 20 highway. Base price at $34,055 and the options we would choose $38,000. 


<b> <i>The 2002 Explorers are much less truck like than the previous models.</b> </i>  The appearance is different it rides much smoother, is much roomier and more comfortable. The 2002 Explorer is quieter, bigger, and safer.  Towing shouldn�t be a problem especially with the optional class three towing package.  The price is middle range for the medium sized SUV�s.  The engine has the power to pull and tow but is still lacking a bit in the taking off from a dead stop area.  Compare to other SUV�s the Explorer is much quieter.  With the mid-sized SUV market flooded, the 2002 Explorer offers many  new features that the competitors don�t have.  The new  2002 4 Wheel Drive Explorer is a nice ride for the price.



<i>The Ford Explorer 4WD has four models for 2002;  Explorer XLS 4WD, Explorer SLT 4WD, Explorer Limited 4WD, and the Explorer Eddie Bauer 4WD.</i>
