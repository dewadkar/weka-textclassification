            In today's economy many people are searching for the best way to save money.  But not a lot of people are willing to give up their cars and the freedom you get with having your own car.  You look around finding the best deal on gas, on a lease, on spare parts and body shops.  Well I have the secret to save you thousands!

The 2000 Hyundai Accent is probably one of the most affordable and economical cars around! Costing somewhere in the range of $10,000 or less your looking at a car that will save you in the long run. Now most of you will think that paying so little you must lose out on style and drive, but this isn't the case with this car.  A nice sleek body will have people guessing that this car costs twice as much as the sticker price. The drive is incredible and the room is surprising.  Standing at 6'4 I feel as comfortable driving this car as i did a truck.  It handles with great response and has a road side warranty that makes all other pale in comparison.  

Great mileage and a great sticker price will have you falling in love with this car! So get to your dealer and give it a spin, ill promise you wont regret it!
