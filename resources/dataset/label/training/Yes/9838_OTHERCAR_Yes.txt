            I went into purchasing this car with a bad feeling inside, I was saying to myself everything negative I could think of. The company is too young it's going to be badly made, And didn't this company make CD players before cars?...that'd be a big change. But still the voice inside me said just go for it, so I did and I got one of the biggest surprises in my life this car is the best deal I've ever gotten. It's the perfect size for my and a very nice looking car and so far after almost 3 months it hasn't given me any trouble at all. My daughter drives a BMW and is constantly begging me if she can take out my car. The cars corners turns perfectly, makes no noise except the relaxing minute hum of the motor and appears to be ready to last me for many years to come. This car is a great buy, just give a new company a chance and let them show you their stuff.<br><br>
