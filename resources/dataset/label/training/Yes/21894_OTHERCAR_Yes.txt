            My wife's lease on a Volvo S70 was about to expire.  We went looking for new cars.  I wanted to stay in the $35,000 price range, so we started with Volvo's.  I was not pleased with Volvo's new S-60.  It felt awkward.  I drove the new Lexus IS300 and liked it very much; similar to a BMW 3 series.  I would have bought it, but I just couldn't get the price right.  We than went to a BMW dealership to look at the new 3 series.  We drove a few and I liked them all.  I'm sort of a sports car guy, as I own a '69 Corvette.  But my wife thought the 3 Series was a bit small for her and our 2 kids.  Anyway, a bit disappointed not to get the nod on the 3, the dealer mentioned a 1998 528i.  We took a test drive, and wow.  We loved it. We got a great deal and drove it home that night.

The interior is great.  It feels like I should have paid a lot more money than I did.  I don't have any real complaints on the interior, except the ubiquitous cup holder complaint.  Although, the sound system is not very good. Even with the DSP, it pales in comparison the the Volvo's Alpine sound system.  Oh well, BMW makes up for it in other areas.  Like the engine.

That straight six is like buuudddda.  Even then, it gives you a good &quot;growl&quot; under acceleration.  I love that.  The Volvo sounds like a two cycle weedeater compared to the Bimmer.  I'm particularly impressed with what BMW does with 193 horsepower.  I guess it's the VANOS working, but power is available at all RPM.  It's faster than it should be.

I like the subtleness of the exterior.  It doesn't scream at you, rather hits you with it's sexiness after a second glance.  Those are the kind of girls you marry.
  
Driving the car is unbelievable.  I really feel funny telling my friends this.  They don't understand.  I wouldn't have either had I not driven it.  The handling, the power and the comfort are what makes this car worth the money.  I felt like I got a pretty good deal at the time of purchase and now that I've owned it for a while, I feel like I ripped them off.<br><br>
