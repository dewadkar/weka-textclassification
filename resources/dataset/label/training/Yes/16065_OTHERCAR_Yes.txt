            Why do I think that Jeep is mean? Because they consistently and emphatically humiliate their competition.  Jeeps are selling so well that last year, a 15-year-old design (Cherokee) set a new sales record.  The new Grand Cherokee is just another display of how Chrysler's engineering group is vastly underpaid.  The first thing that comes to mind when you see a new Grand Cherokee is &quot;Wow, that looks big!&quot;  The new model does appear larger from the outside, and the inside, but it is only marginally larger than the first generation, and it drives like it is the same size.  I had the chance to drive a new Grand Cherokee recently and can whole-heartedly say that the bar has been raised.  This was my first opportunity to sample the improvements Jeep has made to its flagship.  I was very impressed.  Everything about this vehicle speaks of vast improvements in its design.

Before I get too much into the mechanical stuff, I'd like to talk about the interior.  I drove a Laredo V8 with leather, and I was very pleased with the fit and finish of the interior. Jeep has made excellent use of its now-corporate partner Mercedes in the interior styling department.  The dash is formal and well executed and has a very upscale feel to it.  The gauges are all clear and easy-to-read, and the seats are marvelous.  I found the '99-'00 model easier to enter and exit than the older models as well.  I should mention that the HVAC controls in the Laredo sit in an empty-looking space on the console.  The Limited versions fill this space with a more elaborate control layout that is much more fitting to the interior environment.  I also wish the power seats came standard with a memory function, but alas, that is reserved for the Limited versions as well.

From a performance stand point the new models are a step ahead of the entire class.  While the line lost the speedster 5.9 Limited model (my father-in-law's personal vehicle), the stock V8 is now more suited to this type of vehicle.  It delivers the power much more smoothly and the new &quot;Quadra-Drive&quot; system works very well.  I spent a few moments in a 6-cylinder Limited and wish the small motor came standard with the now-optional 3.73:1 rear axle ratio, because it just doesn't pull like you want it too when attached to a 4000 pound vehicle.  The Grand Cherokee also steers directly and confidently, to a higher degree than any other solid-front-axle vehicle ever built and some independent front suspensions too.  I only miss one thing about the old 5.2L and 5.9L engines, the exhaust note.  The new 4.7 just doesn't cut it for growl.  I still like the exhaust note of the new motor though, it fits the category better and makes the interior Lexus-quiet.  But, oh the rumble of a pushrod V8!

I also should mention that the Uni-Body construction of the Jeep products makes them far quieter and give them better off-road capabilities compared to its body-on-frame competitors. (Only the Cherokee and Pathfinder share this trait)

My only performance/mechanical gripe is that the only way to get &quot;positive&quot; traction axles on a  V8 model is with the new Quadra-Drive system.  The system is great for snow, ice, rain, gravel, etc... but the center differential cannot be locked in High Range.  Only the Selec-Trac transfer case offers a locked center diff in high, and it cannot be ordered with Trac-Loc axles in the V8 (and not at all with the progressive axles from the Quadra-Drive), so to get a locked center diff in high range, you have to get a six-cylinder.

In closing I would like to address pricing.  The new Grand Cherokee is priced along-side the Ford-Explorer (no matter what a Ford salesman tells you) and they have a great reliability and resale record.  The import models in this price range do not offer near the level of performance and similar prices.  The only vehicles that under-cut the price are the Cherokee and Blazer, both of which are far, far smaller.

I have a few friends with first-generation Grand Cherokees and they all love the things.  The only significant quality issue I have heard of are the electrical gremlins common in Jeeps made before 1995.  I worked at a Ford/Jeep dealer for several months and we used to turn around Jeep trade-ins at least three times as fast as Explorer and Blazer/Jimmy trades, I also saw a marked improvement in quality on the 1995/6 and up models, including the disappearance of the electrical gremlins.<br><br>
