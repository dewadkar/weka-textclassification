            Background
Well I purchased my 1991 Thunderbird with a 3.8L V-6 from my parents over 2.5 years ago.  I have put on over 31,000 miles in that time.  The car was in our family since 1993.  

Pros
I have always enjoyed a two door automobile and the Thunderbird is a mildly spacious one.  The seats are very comfortable and still look close to new even with 121,000 miles on the car.  The car also gets respectable gas mileage.  I have averaged roughly 17-24 in city-highway driving.  The car has also been quite economical given that I have only had to replace the heater core and a throttle position sensor in almost 3 years.  It was also pleasant to note that the first time the front brake pads were changed was around 80,000 miles and the brake shoes were changed at close to 110,000 miles, practically unbelievable for any car!!!!!

Cons
This car is a nice looking automobile, one that has not fallen out of style, but the car is a dog in the speed category.  It was quick when my parents bought it, but with age the speed factor has diminished considerably.  The car is pretty bad on icy roads, but with sand bags in the trunk that problem can be easily corrected.  The Thunderbird also seems to have a tendency to rust.  No matter how many car washes it has seen it seems to still rust.  One of the last noticeable cons has been the car's insatiable appetite for coolant.  Every oil change I add roughly a quarter of a gallon of coolant.  

Mechanical Problems
1.   Blown Headgasket (85,000 miles)
Note: Blown Headgasket could have been attributed to car being run out of coolant prior to my purchase.     
2.   Throttle Position Sensor (90,000 miles)
3.   Heater Core (100,000 miles)
4.   Seatbelt Tracking for automatic seatbelts became       misaligned (50,000 miles)
5.   Drivers Side Hub replaced (80,000 miles)

Overall
I think this is a really nice car for how many miles was on it when I purchased it and how it is aesthetically.  I would recommend this to any friend provided they can drive a rearwheel car in the winter.  It has treated me well and I think it is a car that will offer happiness to almost any driver.
