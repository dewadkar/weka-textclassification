            Do you feel lost in the high tech revolution???? You aren't alone! I was very skeptical of spending my hard earned dollars on a &quot;digital camera. &quot;  So what if it was the rage!!! What did I need one for??? I'm a college grad., a nurse by profession, but never learned to type or use computers. Then I bought my first computer (for the kids to improve their academic skills) and I was hooked, but still very technically challenged.

 My newest hobby is online auctions. As a mommy of 5 I was excited to be able to purchase quality used clothing at affordable prices, after all, how could I lose... After  the children outgrew them, I could resell them right?  Wrong! ..My items didn't sell, or sold for much less than others half as nice!!!I needed to add images!!! Pictures sell 100% better than words, so I bought this first camera. The Kodak DC 210 plus is  affordable and quite a bit of camera for the money! The pictures are crisp and clear compared to others in its class.  I have even had bidders contact me to ask what camera I owned as the pictures were &quot; the best they had seen!&quot; I  had to chuckle here because my sister had just bought one for $1000 MORE than I paid for the same purpose!!!This camera package also comes with software programs to edit, enlarge, frame, add captions to, email and save your photos! The best part is that they are all user friendly!!! Even for someone like me!!!!
I have used mine now for over a year and can honestly say that it has been a trouble free year! My only complaint is that it seems to eat batteries! They just wont hold a charge, so I am only using it with its plug in adapter. That's ok for my needs now but there have been many times I wish the batteries worked so that I could take it along to my childrens events , then email the pics to family! Still, overall I like this camera and am happy with my first choice!
