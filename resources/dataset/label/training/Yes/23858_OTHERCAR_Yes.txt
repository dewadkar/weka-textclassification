            Dodge Caravan's make great family vehicles.  They are great for bigger families, which mine is, and also good for smaller families that do a lot of traveling.  Not that bigger families don't travel much, of course!  I like my van for its roominess and the fact that my kids could spread out and not fight as much when we go places. The van drives very nicely, and does good in between maintinence checks.  I have found that a lot of people own Caravans even if they don't have big families like I do.  I think that is a testamant to how functional they are for anyone to use!<br><br>
