            Bought a Honda accord coupe last year, a 1998.  What a gorgeous car.  Comfortable, handling is superb!  Sporty yet luxurious.  V6 engine makes it fast and quick.  Have had absolutely no problems with it.  Can't think of anything I don't like about it yet.  
extremely quiet ride.  I would definitely recommend this automobile to anyone looking in this price range.I purchased this Honda because of the past experiences with Hondas, all positive.  Reliability.                 Sound system in this Honda is more than adequate, sounds really nice!  The power seats are a nice added bonus, works very well, improves the comfort level.  This is a beautiful automobile for the price!  I would definitely recommend it to friends looking in this particular price range, I don't think you can go wrong.      <br><br>
