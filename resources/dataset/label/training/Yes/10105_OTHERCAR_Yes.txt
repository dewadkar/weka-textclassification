            I own a 1996 Mercury Sable LS. I love the way this car runs and handles.  My wife says I was going through a midlife crisis when I purchased this car.  It has a 3.0 liter, 24 valve V6 engine, sunroof, 6 stack CD player leather trimmed interior and special wheels. It has a lot more power than I really need but it's great to have it when you need it.  I've had no major problems with this car through approximately 45,000 miles. The only real problem I've had is with the passenger side door handle. It doesn't want to open correctly when the temperature outside starts to drop in the winter. Summer, no problem, winter, here we go again. My dealer says it's getting out of adjustment, but they can't seem to get it right. Another worker in the same shop told me that a lot of Sable's and Taurus's had this problem  No other problems and I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a fun, sporty 4 door sedan that looks great!<br><br>
