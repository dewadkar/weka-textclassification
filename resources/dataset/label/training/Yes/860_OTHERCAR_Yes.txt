            THE PICTURES
I have owned this camera for a year now and, because I have two young kids, it gets a workout.  This is not my first digital camera, but it is by far and away my favorite.  To single out the best quality: the color.  Seldom in digital cameras do you get good skin tones.  No problem here.  My pictures look natural and true to the subject.  Other colors are equally precise without being over saturated.  Finally I have a camera that captures the color of my green lawn without look muted or fake.  Focus is always crisp and automatic.  The healthy zoom is quick and responsive.  I have read that Olympus has superior glass (as opposed to plastic) lenses and I believe it.  In all, the quality of the pictures keeps me reaching for my little wonder.

I make a habit out of using the highest resolution setting on jpeg format.  While I could squeeze many more pictures onto my Smartmedia memory card with a lower resolution, I figure that I might as well take the and keep the best pictures and weed out the marginal pics � this is after all a digital camera so I delete data like a madman.  By using the highest resolution, I always have the option of printing the picture even at 8 x 10 without compromise.  I encourage other uses not to be shy either; hard drive space is cheap nowadays and they will only get bigger and cheaper.  So live a little.   

OTHER FEATURES
Other notable qualities include a terrific video feature that delivers 30 second Quick Time movies.  While the resolution and color quality of these movies are low, they are par for the course in the industry.  Seldom do I reach for my digital video recorder, preferring instead to rely on the mini movies offered by the Olympus.  It is very convenient to use, and I capture so many moments that I would certainly miss with a full-fledged video camera.  Also, for those who have young kids, having hundreds of little mini movies accessible and organized on the computer is a blessing; my daughters love these clips whereas we never break out the recorder to watch the longer movies.  I anticipate, however, that the value of the mini movies will decrease as my kids mature.  We�ll see.  

I sometime use extras such as black and white, sepia, and other special photography options.  I particularly enjoy the remote control option that allows me to snap repeated shots while I am part of a family group on holidays or vacations.  

THE PHYSICAL PACKAGE
The fit and finish is very good.  The unit is light and small although not pocket sized.  It feels solid in the hand and comfortable to grip even in my large hands.  The LCD screen is bright and easily visible except in direct sunlight.  

SPECIFICATIONS
The C-3000 Zoom is a 3.34 pixel (2048 x 1536 pixel resolution) model which uses the equivalent of a 32-96mm lens with F-2.8 to F-11 aperture adjustable in 1/3 stop increments throughout the entire zoom range.  The camera offers fifteen resolution/quality modes so if you do not heed my advice you can certainly opt for file sizes much smaller than the typical 650kb pictures that I snap.  Supported formats are JPEG, uncompressed TIFF, Wave, and QuickTime Motion JPEG.  While the vast majority of the time I rely on the auto exposure function, I sometime venture out of the kids playground and toy with the Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual exposure modes.  Depending on the light source, I will tinker with the exposure compensation that is offered from -2 to +2 in 1/3 EV increments.  Also, the camera includes an adjustable flash that I find particularly helpful because I frequently reduce the flash intensity in close shots to prevent overexposure.  As previously mentioned, the camera utilizes Smartmedia to record pictures and my unit shipped with an inadequate 8 MB card.  While it utilizes a direct USB connection to download files, I have read that it does not play well with my Windows ME so I have relied exclusively on a third-party card reader.  Other specification that should be listed: a 1.8 inch, TFT color LCD display, shutter speeds from 1 to 1/800 seconds in auto exposure mode and 16 to 1/800 in manual mode, variable ISO settings, self timer, and the camera can accommodate external flash and tripod. 

MINOR GRIPES
The camera is not perfect.  The interface is not intuitive and, for example, I have to do some guesswork each time I need to reset the date and time after installing recharged batteries.  As is common with its ilk, it chews through batteries and I strongly recommend using lithium ion rechargeables and a high quality charger.  The camera does not shut down quickly enough for my taste, and I am always waiting for it to finish writing to memory the mini films so I can shut it down and put on the lens cap.  There is no lens cap tether so you�ll have to go to the camera store and sell out three bucks what would have cost Olympus a mere dime to provide.  The sound on the movies is subpar and distorted.  Adjusting the aperture is not as easy as it should be, and when set to extreme aperture settings, the camera does not readily pick the foreground/background object.  Finally, like many digital cameras, the viewfinder does not accurately frame the pictures but the LCD does.  

BOTTOM LINE
The camera takes fantastic pictures and delivers lots of other goodies.  I have yet to see its equal in its price range.
