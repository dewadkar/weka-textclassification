            I bought this camera after doing a lot of research on the net and visiting local camera and PC stores.  The MX-2900 is easy to handle and has many features that remind me of my 35MM.  Although the MX-2900 is a tad slow in the f stop, it never bothers me because I adjust my exposures as necessary.  It has the best color results and images over the Olympus, Toshiba and Epson. This camera handles very quick, no hunting for controls.  This camera has a metal alloy body...not cheap plastic.

It has a hot shoe for a more powerful flash unit or used with a slave.  I tried the Toshiba and it malfunctioned after a few minutes.  The Epson handled nicely, but I did not like the batteries and color results.

Each shot that I have taken with the MX-2900 has the quality similar to the thoughtful and creative composition obtained on a large format camera, or a twin lens camera.  This camera gives professional results.

The MX-2900 came with a smartMedia reader and an external (cheap but it works) flash.  I also use my Nikon Speedlight SB-25 flash on top for superb results.

I paid $549.00 at the EggHead Digital camera auction area.

This camera has been flawless and I enjoy using it! My wife,and my children love it!<br><br>
