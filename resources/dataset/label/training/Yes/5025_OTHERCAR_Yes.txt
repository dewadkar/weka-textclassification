            I bought this vehicle a year ago primarily because of rebates offered and 0% financing, and I liked the style.  This is a true &quot;sports sedan&quot;.  I have over 39,000 miles on it.  I travel 60 miles each way to work on interstate 25 between Denver and Colorado Springs, with speed limits of 75mph and very heavy traffic.  My previous car was an Infinity.  I have found this car to be the finest vehicle I have ever owned.  It's &quot;cat like&quot; reaction at high speed and in traffic plus the all wheel anti-lock brakes have been a life saver under the severe driving condition I experience daily.  It has been a wonder in icy conditions which are common at the 7000+ feet of altitude I encounter.

I change the oil and do the normal maintenance and that's about all.  I have not spent one dime on any kind of repair and the car is still as tight as the day I bought it.  The only other expense I have has is for winter &quot;ice&quot; tires.  I do recommend staying with the Goodyear Eagles for normal driving conditions.  The ice tires cause a little softer feel for the driver.

If you want a vehicle with sports style and sports handling that will give you no trouble, this is a car you should consider.  It also has full size interior room, comfortable for 4 &quot;full size&quot; adults.
