            We traded our Ford Expedition for the LX 470 because my husband had ridden in one and loved it.  It is far heavier than the Expedition, and you can tell that just by driving it.  It just proved itself in snow, because we had our first accumulation of snow in years; hubby said it was wonderful, even though he was the first one on our rural streets this morning.

I particularly like the fact that the third seat folds up out of the way.  We kept the seat out of the Expedition because it didn't fold; then when we needed it, it was a major hassle putting it back in.  I also like the height variation control; makes it much easier for my mother to get in and out.  I would really rather it not be full-time 4-wheel drive, but that is the only thing that I even slightly dislike about it.  It does have the stiffer European steering that some people might not like, but we like it very much.

The perpetual 4-wheel drive makes the gasoline consumption pretty drastic, so that should be a major consideration for anybody considering the purchase.  


All in all, it's incredible!<br><br>
