            The Ford mustang is a comfortably priced sports coupe that performs well and is still fun to drive. My Mustang comes equipped with a V6 engine churning out 190 HP. The engine sounds very nice, almost like an eight. The car is equipped with leather, power seats, power windows, locks, cassette, cd and alarm for under $18,000. Get behind the wheel of a mustang and you truly feel as if you're part of great car history. It just feels like an American sports car. My only complaint is that the handling on wet or slick surfaces is downright scary. Being a rear drive vehicle, the car really isn't meant for newby drivers. The back seat is very cramped, while the front has plenty of room. All in all, a great car at a great price. Recommended.<br><br>
