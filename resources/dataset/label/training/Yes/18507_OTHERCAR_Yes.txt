            First trip to the mountains during snowstorm proved the Passat to be better than my old Legacy L.  While the Legacy did well, sometimes you could feel the AWD taking effect on steeper/icier surfaces, no such problems with the Passat. The 4motion/Quattro AWD system is one of the best around if not the best.  The V6 performs very well cruising at 80mph on the highway and averaged ~25mpg on 340 mi. trip. Note: The AWD drive wagon should probably fit somwhere in the SUV/sport wagon category, rather than family/pseudo sport category.
1000 MILE UPDATE: Well, after reading the other reviews and comments, I've decided to give an update after 1000 miles of driving.  I've noticed some reviewers who give LONG reviews on cars they don't own and test drive only once (check nasty thread on Top reviewer's comments), which is why I based my purchase on Consumer Reports and friends who happen to own a Passat.  They stand the test of time and experience.  OK, after 1000 miles, the thing that really stands out is the gas mileage is a lot worse than expected.  I do a lot of city driving and have been averaging about 18 mpg overall.  I think this is due to the fact that I have a 4Motion wagon.  I do a lot of outdoor sports and am an obsessive snowboarder, so AWD was  a prerequisite for a car purchase.  From other publications I've read, the front wheel drive has traction and stability control which should fare well in rainy/light snowy conditions, so if you don't absolutely need AWD, go for the FWD.  Your MPG should go up ~4 mpg, more if you get the 1.8T engine (A lot cheaper).  I've only encountered one sample defect so far, the leather upholstery under the driver's seat came undone, but was fixed by the dealer, no charge.  No others found yet which is pretty good considering the GLX is loaded with a LOT of features that can malfunction.  Have not had any problems with rattles and noises that I've read about in 1 or 2 reviews.  I've also had numerous compliments about the styling from strangers.  Hopefully VW will add more interior storage on future models. I think I'd still rate this 5 stars.  It all depends on what YOU are looking for, it is NOT a sports car, but a LOT sportier than others in its class - Outback, Camry, et. al.  It has less room than an SUV but rides better, gets better MPG, lower emissions, and has better emergency handling.  It's not a luxury car, but can be loaded like one for a whole lot less dinero than a 3 series, Audi, or Benz.  I've checked out the Audi A4 wagon, and my personal preference is for the styling of the Passat.  The Audi is a lot more expensive when optioned similarly to the GLX with the only benefit being the Audi name and slightly better handling, but of course, I've only test driven the Audi, so I'm not an expert. Phew, that's about all I've got time for, happy hunting.
Original:
I used to own a Subaru Legacy which I loved, and was shopping for top of the line VDC and Passat 4Motion wagon.  I went to a dealer that sold both and was immediately enamored with the Passat.  After the test drive I could not spend close to the same amount for the Subaru, which I felt was a great car.  The only problem was that demand for the Passat AWD wagon was such that there were only 3 left in CA at the time I decided to purchase.  After an exhaustive search, I found a dealer that had a color that I liked and was willing to sell under MSRP.  According to the dealers that I spoke with, they will not receive any new ones for another 4 months.  So far I love it.  We got a good rainstorm right after my purchase and the AWD Passat handled the wet conditions like a champ.  Smooth V6 engine and fairly good acceleration.  The only complaint is that the glove compartment is too small and the center console storage is really small.
