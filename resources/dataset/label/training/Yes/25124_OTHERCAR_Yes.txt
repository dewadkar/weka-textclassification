            We recently purchased a 2003 Chevy Tahoe LT and I LOVE it! 

My son plays on a traveling baseball team and we needed a vehicle that could carry bat bags, fold up nets, equipment bags, suitcases, coolers, chairs and boys! We just got back from a 10 day trip to a World Series Baseball Tournament for my son -- and I couldn't have been happier with the truck. 

We purchased the LT model and it came with some nifty options:

*On Star
*Power adjustable gas and brake pedals ( great for a short person like myself ) 
*Tri-zone climate control ( The driver's side, passenger side and rear part of the vehicle get individual controls) *Passenger Sensing System for the right front passenger air bag ( Small LCD screen on bottom of rear view mirror tells me if it is on or not, this screen can be turned off. Rear view mirror also tells you direction and temperature )
*Rear-seat DVD player with a roof-mounted screen flips down and comes with wireless headphones  ( This has been a JOY! My son also plugged his X-Box into it and he was thrilled! )
*Room for 8
*Second-row bucket seats 
*In Dash 6 Disc CD Changer/Stereo with Bose sound
*Double visors with extenders 
*Three power outlets in front and one in back ( We plugged a mini refrigerator into the one in the back and saved money on soda/water and food for the trip )
*Three-point belts for all second-row passengers ( YEAH! )
*Heated leather seating with eight-way power adjustment 
*Power-heated side mirrors with turn signal indicators 
*Puddle lamps 
*Autoride suspension controls rear air shocks to provide real-time suspension damping

This truck does NOT get good gas mileage. ( I average 14-17 MPG ) I knew that when I bought it. I wish it did, however, the trade off is more space and a vehicle that does what I need it to do. We are on the road a lot and we need space and comfort for the trip. The On Star system was a perk that I was iffy about, however when I left my keys in the truck and my husband and his set were already at the ballpark a quick call to On Star unlocked the car without a hitch.

The third row seats can be quickly folded and flipped out of they way. They are easy to remove - fold down, flip up, grab the release handle, and roll them out on their wheels!

I think that the Tahoe is an attractive truck and I am very happy with it. It is comfortable,I would recommend it to anyone needing a little more space with a few amenities!
