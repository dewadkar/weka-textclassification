               I baught the Toyota Camry because I wanted a car that was reliable, stylish, and fun to drive. I also wanted a specific set of features, and the camry had them. I baught the lowest version of the camry 2000, the camry ce, but I added features. What I ended up with was a car with the same features as the higher priced camry le, but for less. 
   I got a black camry with grey interior and it is beautiful. It has a cd player with 6 speakers, am/fm radio, tape deck, air conditioning, power windows and locks, tilt, cup holders in the front and back, head rests for front and back seats, dual airbags, and as powerfull of a V-4 engine that exists. This car is surprisingly luxerious and quite, and handles well.    Its acceleration and power surpass the corrola easily and its features are great. While I baught this car recently, I have driven it a fair amount with no problems. I got it for 18 thousand bucks despite the fact that I got some features that were not standard on the ce model, and not only that I was able to trade in a leased car with damage on it and extra mileage for free! Basically I paid 18 thousand bucks for a phenomenal car and I got rid of an old leased car that I owed about 2000 dollars in extra mileage and body damage. For you math people that means in real money terms I paid 16 thousand for the camry! 
    Clearly this car is a great value, with good safety features as well as good luxury features. It drives well, handles curves great, and has adequet power. Passengers fit failry comfortably in the front and back and the trunk has a good amount of space. 
   The sound system is outstanding as well. Even the gas mileage is good at 25 mpg (city) and 31mpg (highway). I have nothing bad to say about the camry it is simply a great car. Oh I forgot to mention it has cruise control and a very sleek look as well. I love it!<br><br>
