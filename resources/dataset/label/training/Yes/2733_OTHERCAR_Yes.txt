            I have been a Chevy man since my first 4x4, but I fell in love with my Suburban on the first test drive. I was needing a vehicle that I could hunt in, but also big enough to take my friends out in. The Chevy Suburban was the perfect vehicle.

I was amazed at how well the Suburban handled and also how smooth the truck rode. It is a perfect vehicle for those long trips. The Suburban has a very roomy interior which offers plenty of leg room, even for the person in the back seat.

I am also impressed with the gas mileage that my Suburban gets. I get approximately 15 miles to the gallon. <br><br>
