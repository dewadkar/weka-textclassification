            Since I bought my Nissan 200 sx five years ago, about 3 people I know have bought Acura's.  The quality of this car is excelent.  My friends haven't had any problems with it not to mention they skipped a few tune ups.  The ride from the back seat and passenger seat are pretty good.  Pretty good meaning that the back is a little small but the car makes up for that.  The passenger seat is roomy and has a bucket seat which makes it comfortable.  The car has some power, I had the oppurtunity to drive it.  Up hills it has enough power unlike most compact cars, that struggle in power to get to the top.  I recommend this purchase, it probably will be my next.<br><br>
