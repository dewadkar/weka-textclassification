            I bought this vehicle because I was an outcast in society.  Noticing that all the other teens my age at the time were into the small sport rocket cars with the 1000 dollar hub caps.  I decided that I wanted something with a little more backbone.  I purchased the 93' used, for about 13000.  It has the V8 and the all time all wheel drive, with the tow package.  I love this car because it lives with me.  When I need to go to the mountains for a little snowboarding action, I can just fold down the 1/3 seating and still have room for 2 passengers in the back seat. (It's a tight fit, but, Hey, were in college so why not?).  I've driven models of this car without the V8 and all the tow stuff, and people let me tell you, it's like a very large sports car, it hugs the ground nicely and handles very wheel.  Now, let me tell you about the V8 and tow package, it's wonderful, sometimes I feel like I'm driving and F 350, just the sound of the engines roar waters my mouth.  Then again it also waters the credit card on gas payments.  I would suggest this car to everyone that wants a car that they can always depend on, NO MATTER WHAT.   To people that think a car should run well, even if it's not pampered.  To people who want their vehicle to perform for every dollar they put into it.<br><br>
