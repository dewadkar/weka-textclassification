            The 98' Jeep Wrangler that my family has is the coolest car you could ever wish for.  It is a combination of a small luxurious type of car with an attitude for driving off road.  It is so much fun to ride in.  Ever since we got it, we can't stop riding in it.  We are always proud when people see us driving in our Jeep and smile or point as if the really want the car.  I would highly recommend getting this car for yourself or your family.  Either way, you and/or your family will enjoy it thoroughly.  You will love the drives on the open road, the drives off road, and most of all the way the people look at you.  It makes you feel like you have made a good investment, and trust me, it is!<br><br>
