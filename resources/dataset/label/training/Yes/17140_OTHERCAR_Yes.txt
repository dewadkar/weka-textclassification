            I bought it based on a lot of reviews I read here and elsewhere. For the price, you can't beat it if you want one with manual override settings.

Right out of the box I was taking great photos! I used to be a portrait photographer and was used to SLR cameras. This offers less options in manual, yet more ability to get the shot you want by using the immediate feedback of seeing what you just shot! SLR photography still has artistic advantages, but digital is a lot more fun and easier and cheaper!

The software to upload the images is great, too; however, I did have a problem getting it loaded. I called Canon and got right through and they got me up and running in 5 minutes! (There is a known problem with Windows 98, so if you have problems, call them and they'll get you up and running in no time.)

Once I had the software loaded, I went right to work adjusting brightness and contrast a little, cropping, and sending photos in email. It's great for sending email photos - it sizes them right down to smaller files and smaller sizes that your friends on 56k modems will be able to download without waiting all day.

I LOVE this camera! It has re-sparked my nearly-dead interest in taking pictures. I had all my slr cameras stolen years ago and since then had been using a Pentax auto shoot camera. Nice little auto-shoot camera, but doesn't compare to this! All my friends have commented on the sharpness and clarity and great look of these Canon A40 photos!

I highly recommend it. BUT, be aware that you are going to have to shell out at least another $30-40 for more memory, $30-70 for a battery recharger, and $30-70 for an AC adaptor. I found out too late that there are non-Canon ac adaptors cheaper (about half price). I bought a Maha battery recharger which I highly recommend. Oh, and you'll need 2 sets of 4 NiMH rechargeable batteries. Do NOT buy the NiCad ones, they aren't nearly as good!
