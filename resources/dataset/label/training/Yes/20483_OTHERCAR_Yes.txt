            I just purchased a brand new 2003 Eclipse GTS. I looked at the Tiburon and the Acura RSX but ended up with this because of the ride and performance.

I was originally tempted by the current 0-0-0 deal Mitsubishi finance offer. But after reading the small print and finding out that the APR switches to 7.9% after the first year I went for the 0 down and 0% for 60 months.

The things I love about this car are..

- It's looks, it looks (and acts) like a sports car.
- The sportronic transmission. I am always tempted to get a manual transmission for performance but hate the idea of a clutch for stop start driving. This gives you the best of both worlds.
- 210HP engine. 0 - 60 in 6.9. 1/4 mile in just over 15 sec. I am not a street racer but I like the zip.

Things I am not to hot on..

- It's turning circle is worse than my old F150 truck!
- The back seat space is very small. But then again I did not buy it with passengers in mind. Trunk space is limited as well.
- $26K is a lot of money.

Overall..

The inside is well laid out and looks very good. The ride is very solid and goes round corners like its on rails. I am not a small or short guy and there is ample room for me. The leather upholstery is very comfortable and looks stylish. It looks great (but not 350Z great).

Final word..

It is a hell of a lot of fun to drive. My wife thinks I am going middle age, my son thinks it is a &#145chick&#146 car. Neither is true.
