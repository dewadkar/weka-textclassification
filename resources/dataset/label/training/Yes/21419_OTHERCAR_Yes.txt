             I purchased the Elantra VE model Arctic Silver automatic, here in Canada. I love the ride and speed of this sedan and would like to share my findings with you. This is an unbiased report of the Canadian model as I have never owned a Hyundai before. I hope it helps others  to have better knowledge on the Elantra before making a vehicle decision.
 The interior has lots of room, front and back. Front cupholders are in a good location away from the stereo unlike Sentra and Corolla. They also support two large coffees well. The air conditioner is strong and their controls are easy to work. The dash is nothing fancy but it does the job of supporting the controls in the proper places. At night it elluminates quite nicely including the drivers side control centre. Guages are clear and easy to read and it comes with a factory tach. It came with an AM-FM-CD player standard. It has good sound but does have slightly smallish controls. Removal of the stereo unit is simple to prevent theft by just pushing a button. It has numerous storage spaces in the dash, console and behind the seats. Seats are comfortable and accomodate tall people well as I am 6' myself. The seats have a manual six way adjustable driver's seat that allows height adjustment easily. It also comes with a lumbar support and fully reclining buckets. I found the ride is very comfortable and quiet. There are also three anchor points in the back seat for my baby's car seat which was a nice feature for this family man. 
 I love the exterior look as I find it looks very stylish. The lights work very well at night for good vision. My gas mileage has been pretty good at about 30mpg average which is roughly the same as the Ford Focus. The warranty here is 3y bumper and 5y on powertrain which matches or exceeds all competitors. Best of all the price which eliminates the rest like Civic, Focus, Saturn, Sentra and Corolla.
 Unfortunately we lose a few options here in the north like moonroof, overhead maplights and keyless remote for some strange reason. We do get summer's up here too you know!. There are no rear cupholders either for your kids or car poolies either. Our CD player in this car has small controls but the stereo sounds fine. If your really serious about your audio you may want to change this stereo anyway. 
 Overall for the list of features you get, I don't think you can find a better car for such a good price. The great warranty they offer should help to reasure any doubt you might have about their quality. I highly reccommend the Elantra, test drive one for yourself and see that "driving is believing".
