            When it came down to that time of my life to purchase a new car, I made quite a big deal out of it.  I searched online manufacturer's.  I did surveys on what the best car for me is.  I went far and beyond to find my car and I didn't have to go far at all.  
The first dealership I went to was a Volkswagen dealership near my home town in Madison, WI.  Friendly, servicing, comfort, informative, and very unbais, were all the feelings I got from when I first walked into the door.  These people knew, through some kind of telepathy they told me, that this car was for me.  I wasn't pressured at all. I looked around, test drove one of the new Jettas and then I took off, because I thought it was too good to be true.  I went to other nearby dealerships trying to find a better car than the 2000 VW-Jetta.  To my surprise, there were none.  I went straight back to the VW dealership and pondered the decision, when all of the sudden I saw it.  Money signs flashed above this car and in an instant I knew it had to be mine.  
I'm talkin about the Turbo-Diesel Injected Jetta.  It was sleek, it was luxuriously packed with leather and all the bells and whistles, it was my color(green) and it was definitely affordable.  I hesitated no longer and hopped in the car.  As soon as I sat in the seat, I bonded to it, like it was another part of my body. The leather just wrapped me up like a huge blanket.  I put the fancy designed key in the ignition and listened for that diesel engine.  I was expecting that diesel &quot;CLICK CLICK CLICK&quot; in the engine, but there was barely any, the salesman explained how they insulated the engine to quiet the noise.  Anyway, to get to the point, I fired up the engine and took it for a spin.  On a diesel car, it only offers a stick-shift.  To my knowledge, I've only driven a stick-shift once in my life.  My anxiety grew as I had to pull out of the driveway, I thought for sure I would wreck this car because it was stick.  I told the salesman that too.  He encouraged me not to worry and in that instant, I was off.  I felt like Mario Andreatti, only conservatively patient around the salesman.  This car handled like no other I've driven.  As we neared a corner, he told me to speed up.  Obviously he didn't see the &quot;Slow to 30&quot; rode sign that was brite yellow.  Under his assurance, I put my foot down and hugged that corner.  Nothing!!  It was like slicing a hot knife through butter.  This car handles, this car is beautiful, this car is whitty, this car is...Mine!!!  As soon as we got back, I signed the papers, traded in my other car for an astounding larger price than what I thought I would get and all in all, I didn't have to cry over the damper it put in my wallet.  
Since then, and 10 months later, I've managed to put almost 15,000 miles on my VW-Jetta TDI.  Servicing this car is a breaze, the dealrships treat you outstanding and to give you and idea of the gas mileage I get on my car, I drove from Wisconsin to Florida on one tank of gas.  If you don't believe me, just take a look at the money you save next time you put fill that tank up.
