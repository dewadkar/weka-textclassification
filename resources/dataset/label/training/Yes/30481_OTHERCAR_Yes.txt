            We have a 1986 Toyota Corolla that presently has more than 310,000 miles on it.  In spite of the high mileage this car averages between 31 and 35 miles per gallon (the variation has more to do with the ages of the drivers than with the car itself). With the exception of running out of gas once (my husband's fault) this car has never failed us.  An oil change every 5,000 miles, and a full tank of gas once in a while is all this car has ever needed.  
I would recommend this car to anyone who needs a reliable and economical source of transportation!<br><br>
