            I own a 1993 Cougar XR7 2 door. I have had it for four years now and have mixed feelings about it.It runs great, looks great,but the $1,000 head gasket repair bill shortly before Christmas last year killed me. I was worried about not having front wheel drive when I first bought it. I live in Wisconsin and thought the winter weather would make me become a road hazzard with this car. Not to worry, really had no problems at all. I do not know the reason for this but maybe it is heavy enough for traction, etc.Not a car for young teenagers, they would have too much fun fishtailing in the snow at the school parking lot. So, if you are looking for a decent used car this car would pass.<br><br>
