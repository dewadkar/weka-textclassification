            I bought my first automobile in 1995. It was a domestic compact vehicle.  I owned it for a month, before it had to be towed to the mechanic.  As the years passed, the cost of care for the car began to increase until I finally gave up in May 1999. I decided to look for another method of transportation.  I went to every dealership I could find within a 60 mile radius. I went to Honda, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Dodge, Kia, Ford, Mazda, Chevrolet, etc. Finally the last stop on the list before I gave up hope, Toyota.  I had my research from cruising the Internet, libraries, and friends.  Most of these dealers did not offer me any kind of deal.  They assumed I was inexperienced and naive.  But at Toyota, I got a great deal and a terrific car.  Including all the accessories that I wanted.  It wasn't about making a sale, it was making me comfortable and satisfied.    <br><br>
