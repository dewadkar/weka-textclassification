            I am a mechanic and I bought this vehicle for the reliability and ease of working on it.  The Monte Carlo is one of the most dependable vehicles on the market.  getting this vehicle fixed is a piece of cake and the replacement parts are very reasonable.  You can expect to replace an alternator on the vehicle at about 60000 miles and the brakes will require replacement at 40000.  The good news is that it will not empty you checking account doing this.  If you are a do it yourself type of person it is even cheaper and easily accomplished.   The ride of this vehicle is great and control is excellent.  The vehicle is built very solidly and the quality is what you expect.  This is a very good vehicle for the single person or even a family of four.  You can't go wrong with this car.<br><br>
