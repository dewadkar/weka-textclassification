            This was not my first Digital Camera. I bought it as an upgrade. I was pleased. The fact that the media is a floppy, makes this camera, and the whole mavica line, simple to extract the pictures from the camera. You don't have to mess around with finding a serial port and waiting, or using your PCMCIA port and waiting. There's no waiting, you simply take out the floppy and put into your drive. You can view the pictures after you take them, the large view screen shows you exactly what you're seeing before you take the picture and the optical zoom is a nice feature, although the picture can sometimes get grainy at full zoom. My previous digital camera wasn't obvious when the picture was taken. This one is clear. It tells you with a message on the screen. The floppy access is fast with the thumbnails and it's 2x speed. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good general purpose camera.<br><br>
