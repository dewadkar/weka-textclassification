            I have owned a Jeep Wrangler for about a year now, and I love it.  I like it mostly in the summer because I can take the top down.  People ask me if I stay worm in the winter in my Jeep, and I say yes it keeps me very worm in the winter.  I have a 4x4 Jeep.  The only thing that I wish was better about is that it would have a better sound system.  I am thinking about upgrading my system soon.  This SUV is a very loud ride.  I would not recomend this SUV if you are planning on taking long trips.  In conclusion I recomend the Jeep Wrangler for anyone who is wanting some thing different.<br><br>
