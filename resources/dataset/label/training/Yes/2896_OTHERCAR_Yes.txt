            I am no camera expert, just a mom who wants to take great pictures of her new baby and share them with family over the internet.   The Toshiba PDR-M61 is the perfect digital camera for users of all levels.  I never did read the user manual.  Who has the time? 
  
This is a great camera that Consumer Reports raved about because of it's price, durability and fantastic pictures.   The easy-to-use PDR-M61 offers 2.3 megapixel CCD that captures realistic images with true color and detail at high (1792 x 1200) resolution or medium (896 x 600) resolution.  Anyone who has ever taken picture with a traditional film camera will be taking pictures in no time and downloading their pictures in minutes. It comes with everything needed to connect to your computer: an 8 MB SmartMedia removable memory card, photo editing software for enhancing your photos, a USB connector cable for quick downloading and, in my case, an unused manual.

The camera&#146s settings and LCD adjustment are all menu driven in both camera and playback mode.   But it also has easy-to-use manual controls so that with a simple click of the button, you can quickly change the flash mode or adjust the white balance to accommodate different lighting conditions.   Like the more traditional film cameras, it offers pictures in different formats: ISO100, ISO200, ISO400 and you can choose to take pictures in Black & White for a more classic look.   The 8 MB memory card holds about 25 high quality pictures, 60 medium quality pictures and 125 pictures at the lowest setting. 

Best of all, the auto focus, auto exposure, high resolution and five-mode flash (auto, red-eye reduction, forced flash, slow sync) ensure that you get the picture you want.   And you can use the preview screen to view thumbnails of all your pictures or scroll through each one at a time.  It is quick to start up and fairly quick between shots - the Multi mode setting allows you to capture up to 16 shots in four seconds.  Perfect for new moms and fussy babies.   A self-timer makes sure that you can get in the picture too. 

It has a built-in 1.8-inch color LCD and an optical viewfinder.   While the glass 38mm lens does offer 3X optical zoom for those close-ups, it also blocks the optical viewfinder slightly.   While it doesn&#146t affect the picture, it can be annoying at times.   The camera is compact enough for me, as it fits in my purse, measuring  4.76&#148 wide by 3&#148 high and 2.5&#148 deep and weighing in at about 10 ounces.  It does takes four AA batteries that are eaten alive when left on for any extended period.  But what digital camera doesn&#146t?   For now, I use rechargeable batteries and plan to invest in the optional AC/DC adapter.  The only problem I encountered was that you have to hold down the button for longer than I expected in order to take the picture.   That&#146s why you should always read the manual!

For an amateur photographer or anyone interested in an easy to use camera, that takes crisp pictures - this is the one for you.   Even Consumer Reports says that if you can find one - buy it now&#133 I did!
