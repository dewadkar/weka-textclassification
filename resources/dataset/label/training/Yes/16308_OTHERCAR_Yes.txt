            I never really had any need to take pictures until I became an e-bay user.  So, for last Christmas, I asked for a digital camera, figuring it would be convenient to have one.  Little did I know that it would also be fun!
I can't begin to explain why I like my PhotoSmart camera so much.  I'm certainly not a camera expert, but it just has so many cool features.  For starters, the picture quality is excellent, and there are even 3 different levels of quality to choose from, so you can take small, regular photos or larger, super-high resolution pictures.  Then you can view the picture on the LCD screen and delete it if you'd like or simply keep it.  The only problem with that is that the LCD sucks battery juice like an airplane engine.  The camera also comes with built-in red-eye reduction (you can turn it on or off) and the necessary flash.
The only problem I have had with the camera is that it did not come with a CompactFlash card-reader, which allows you to view your pictures on your computer with ease.  Simply take the card (a.k.a "film") out of your camera and insert it into the card-reader.  I found a SanDisk card-reader for $30 that works wonderfully and even connects through a USB port.  You can even delete your pictures as if they were files on your computer:  highlight them and press Delete.  Had this camera come with a card-reader, I'd have said it was perfect.
I guess one warning I could think of is this:  this camera is not meant for going on scenic trips to take lots of beautiful photos.  Unless you bring a computer along with you (or you have more than one "film" card), you will be stuck with about 40 medium quality photos for the entire trip.  But I would imagine that this is a problem with all digital cameras, not just the PhotoSmart.
Overall, I am very pleased with my digital camera and would recommend it to anyone with an occasional need for photography.  Although the price may be steep, it is well worth the cost because of ease of use and array of options.  Buy one of these and a card-reader of some sort, and your money will be well spent.
