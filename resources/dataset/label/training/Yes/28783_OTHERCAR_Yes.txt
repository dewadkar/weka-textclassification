            I am a total digital photography fan and this is my second digital camera. Well actually third if I could the sony dsc p1 which I returned (we'll get to that one later).

I upgraded to sony dsc s75 3.3 mega pixel camera last year and I ever since I have had this camera I am convinced that sony products are definitely worth it. 

I am not going to tell you about the specifications of this camera. You can read about that on www.sonystyle.com

What I am going to tell you is what I like about this camera and how it differs from a few others I have tried.

1. Carl Ziess lens takes wonderfully sharp and crystal clear pictures. I can say it does make a difference with this lens cause I have tried out sony dsc p1 which is much smaller in size but lacks the power and clarity of carl ziess lens.

2. Excellent battery power: In all the other cameras I have tried the battery needs to be recharged pretty frequently even if I dont use the LCD. With this camera that's not the case. The Stamina battery does last long. Just to give you an example. We recently went to Vermont for columbus day weekend. We were there for 4 days and I used my camera a lot with the LCD on all the time and the battery lasted that long! I was impressed. Charging the battery is pretty easy too. Just leave it on for about an hour and a half and it recharges completely.

3. Powerful flash: One of the complaints I have with the sleeker models is that you need proper sunlight in order to take great pictures. Agreed they are more handy to carry around but it really sucks when you are taking pictures indoors or during the evening outside. That's not the case with sony. It has 3 flash levels and even if I put it on normal it takes great pictures indoors and outdoors at all times! It also has an optional external flash slot if you do need one but I do not see the need for it.

4. Various picture modes: The ones I use the most are landscape and portrait. Both of them come out great and the prints look professional! 

5. Movies: You can make mpegs using this camera but I have only tried it once. Even though its good to have that feature but dont buy it for that. You are better off with a camcorder if you want to make movies :)
