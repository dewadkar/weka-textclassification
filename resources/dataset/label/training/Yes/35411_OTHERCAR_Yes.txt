            In the age of overpriced `luxury' utes, such a value is surprising. If you think value and efficiency are important, then try this ride. This is our second Suzuki Sidekick and we have kept them for 4 years now. The best thing about this vehicle is value. It allowed us to have a 4 door, 4 wheel drive for $10,000; with surprising standard features, such as power remote door locks, air conditioning, custom aluminum wheels, and more. Small interior but with good headroom, it does manage to carry skis, bikes, strollers and plenty of outdoor gear. The rear seat is in a perfect position so that you can put a toddler into his booster seat without wrenching your back, and secure him with child-proof seat belts and rear door locks. The worst thing is the cost of replacement parts. Check you VIN number, if you have a Canadian made engine code (rather than Japan) you can usually buy cheaper Geo Tracker parts that fit. Generally well designed and built, it is true 4 wheel drive with full frame, and not a restyled all wheel drive car. In the winter with full snow tires all around and 4 wheel drive low, nothing stops it. Even when the other utility vehicles are following the plows around. It is also one of the few modern vehicles that you can still change your own oil, spark plugs, and brakes, easily. <br><br>
