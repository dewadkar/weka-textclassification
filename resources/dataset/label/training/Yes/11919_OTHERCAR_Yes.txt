            The AGFA EPhoto 780c is a very good camera for the price of $159.99. The only problem I have had is with the connection from camera to computer. After purchasing a media capture to download pictures, I solved my download problem. My general use is to photographing items for my web site. Very satisfied with the quality of pictures. One of the best features of the AGFA EPhoto 780c is the three setting for close-up shots, Portrait shots and the distance photos. The viewer make it easy to see if you have a good or bad picture in an instant.<br><br>
