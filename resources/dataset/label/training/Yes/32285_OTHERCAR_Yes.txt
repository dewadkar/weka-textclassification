            I bought my VW because it was the only car I could picture myself in (I know that sounds corny). I have had all of the regular scheduled maintenance done to my car and have never had a problem with it. I think this is due mainly to the fact that I have taken care of the car like recommended. I have invested about $7500 in after market products that have been added to the car. Recently I began to take interest in the new Jetta GLX VR6 and decided to sell my 96 GTi. I didn't even need a test drive to be sold. Volkswagons are very powerful with snappy performance. My dealership has always provided the best quality service and call me by my first name. It does take a certain type of person to really love this care but I cannot describe exactly what type of person that is. I have decided to keep my first and buy the new Jetta - the only problem that leaves me with is where to park it!<br><br>
