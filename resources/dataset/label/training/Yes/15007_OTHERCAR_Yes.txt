            I was given my Sony Digital Mavica camera as a Christmas gift. Photographer or techie I am not, but this camera is great. I love it! I set the self timer, took a picture blowing a kiss, and sent it to my grandson via e-mail. This camera is so simple to operate. Pop a floppy in &amp; shoot. You can view what you have taken also. Wow, if it is not great take it over before the shot is gone forever. There are great add-ons as well. The first I have my eye on is the FVP-1 Mavica Photo Printer. I can then take all these wonderful pictures &amp; print them, (NO computer needed). You can go in with your computer &amp; remove red eyes, take items out of the background, remove blemishes or scars, etc. If your like me I like my  KISS rule, (keep it simple sweetie), and this camera is that. <br><br>
