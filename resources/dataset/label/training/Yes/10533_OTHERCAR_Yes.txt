            My wife was looking to buy a car that had more power than her Saturn SC2, and was reliable, and looked good, etc. I didn't want to get her anything that was too powerful, I'd seen her get a little loose in my Rx-7 a few times when the turbo's kicked in. So I ran across this non-turbo Nissan 300ZX at a car lot. It was perfect for her and has been a great car ever since. It now has 137,000 miles on it and it still runs great and never has any problems. Everything electrical in the car (which is everything)still works, which amazes me for it's age. The engine makes just enough HP to keep her interested but is a sane enough amount to keep her from getting into trouble. My only dislike about the car is the brakes. They are probably the worst anti-locks I have ever used. Not that the ABS system doesn't work it's just that the stopping distance isn't great, a very heavy pedal, which I had to instruct my wife that if something ever happens and she needs to stop quickly, then she needs to put both her little feet on that pedal and slam it to the ground as hard as she can.I guess I was used to the phenomenal brakes on my old RX-7. She's good at it now...hehe. The car is great for long trips too, very comfortable and has lots of leg room and head room. Although it's not the fastest thing on 4 wheels (it looks faster than it is)it handles great. Once you get it up into the mountains and start cornering her, she excels beautifully. A great car.
