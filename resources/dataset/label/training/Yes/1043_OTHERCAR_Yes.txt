            I decided to buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee, for a few reasons.  The first and most important was size.  I have 2 children and 3 mastiffs.  The second reason is that I live in Pennsylvania (home of the bad winters and steep hills) and a 4 wheel drive vehicle is a must have.  And the third while not a necessity, but is still important is the look...and Jeep Grand Cherokees look great!  The one thing I love about my vehicle is that it gives me all the necessities and niceties that I was looking for in a vehicle.  It offers luxuries, while still being a very practical vehicle.  The only thing that I hate, well I don't really hate anything, but it does bother me a little bit is the fear of rolling the vehicle or losing control because of the center of gravity.

Driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee is a wonderful experience.  Granted it doesn't ride like a Caddy, but it rides very comfortably.  Makes you feel safe because of the size and height.  One thing that is a plus for those of you contact wearers is you know how in a normal car, oncoming headlights cause an awful glare.  Well with you being up so high it is virtually never happens.

I suggest anyone who wants practicality and a lot of class should buy this vehicle.  And I really can't think of anyone who shouldn't own a Jeep Grand Cherokee.<br><br>
