            We looked into buying a minivan as our family is expanding.  Currently, with the .9% financing that Chrysler is offering on its minivans, we decided to go ahead and look.  We chose the Dodge because we have driven other Dodge vehicles and have been very pleased with their performance.

What we like about this particular make and model:  The van has dual sliding rear doors with the tracks cleverly concealed just under the back side windows rather than an obvious track along the body side.  With an infant/toddler in a carseat, with the larger windows, the child can easily see out and be entertained.  I also enjoy the feeling of riding higher with large windows for increased visibility.  We were also set on purchasing a van with the sunscreen tint on the windows so that our young children are not blinded by sun.

On the model we chose, we went with the optional bucket seats in the middle.  We felt with having two small children in infant seats, this was the most secure placement for use of the seat belts as well as allowing passengers to get through to the far back seat.  There is plenty of room for a small to average size person to fit through the middle without tilting the buckets forward.  However, if you don't have an infant seat in place, the seats tilt forward and allow plenty of room to get to the back.  The bench, however, if using a infant seat with the seat belts would block the passage back.

We were somewhat hesitant about purchasing at this time because I still enjoyed the car I was driving, but there hasn't been a day that we don't find additional bonuses to the van over the car.<br><br>
