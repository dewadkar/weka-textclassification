            I wanted a station wagon to haul my equipment, but they don't make them like they used to.  Most wagons are hatch backs with puny cargo areas.  I looked at a few mini vans and found they didn't carry much either and had uncomfortable seating and lousy repair records.  When I found out Honda was going to make their Odyssey bigger, I decided to wait and see what they came up with.  In November of '98 I got my chance to test drive it an signed up to wait for a blue EX for $23,200. (Yes an EX, not an LX for $23,200)  After a few months I changed it to whatever color came in first.  I didn't know I would have to wait until August of '99.  I really needed something to drive right away, so during my wait, I looked at and test drove tons of new and used wagons and vans.  I could have paid more to get one sooner, but it's not smart to pay over invoice on a vehicle in my opinion.  Nothing came close to the size, functionality and value of the Odyssey, so I continued to wait.  The Ody has much more room and power than other mini vans.  The  Windstar has room and power, but it doesn't have the folding back seat and easy to move middle seats.  It also has a terrible repair record.  The new Mazda MPV has very nice features, including versatile seating, but it lacks the power, smoothness and manoeuverability of the Ody.  The Ody has a few bugs, but Honda is quick to fix things. Tall persons will particularly appreciate the Ody.  There is ample head and leg room.  I tested a few vans that got sluggish when loaded with four adults. If you carry lots of people or equipment, this van can pack 'em in and go.  The only thing I don't like about the Ody is the long wait and the dealers that jack up prices.  The dealer I used was selling them well under MSRP, hence the longer than usual wait.  I'm glad I waited.  You can't beat the all around value of it.  Most people complain about the sound system.  It's o.k. but if you have old tapes, they won't sound good in the Ody.  The radio and CD player sound fine.
