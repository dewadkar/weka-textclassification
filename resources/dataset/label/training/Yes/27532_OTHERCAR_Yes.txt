            I bought this vehicle because I live in the country and needed a four wheel drive vehicle to get me through the snow, ice and sometimes treacherous rain damaged gravel roads on which I live.  Driving this Jeep during those times makes me feel secure and gets me where I need to go, especially back and forth to work in town.

The four wheel drive system on this particular year and model allows me to leave it engaged continuously without damage to the vehicle so I do not have to worry about disengaging it when I reach normal road conditions.  It looks great, yet it does the job I need done!

The overhead information system tells me what the temperature is outside (and warns me when it could be icy on the roads) and exactly what direction I am traveling.  I thoroughly love that!  One thing I dislike about my Jeep is how high it sits off the ground--it's sometimes a chore getting in it to drive.  Unfortunately, this is true of any sports utility vehicle and is a price you pay for the security of getting where you want to go in any type of weather.  Also, it only seats 5 which can be a disadvantage when you need more passenger room and the storage area in the rear is not huge (because the spare tire is housed there, too.)
