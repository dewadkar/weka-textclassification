            We bought our 1999 Plymouth Grand Voyager in July of last year.  We had gone to many new and used car dealers and finally found the perfect vehicle for us at Auto Nation, used, with about 19,000 miles tallied.

Our vehicle is an interesting light shade of olive green, although the color listed on the door is simply &quot;silver&quot;.  It's a nice color, it does have tint but is still light enough to hide dirt and reflect the intense sunlight we get down here in south Texas.  That's the least of its features, however; it has frills such as cup holders everywhere, personalized air conditioning (which, I must say, has prevented many battles between myself and my husband), moveable air vents clear to the back, sliding doors that lock on hills so they won't crush you (and the door won't slide at all if you've left the gas lid open), an abundance of navigator lights, a convenient drawer under the front passenger seat, adjustable/removable seats and a tilt wheel.  Our van even has a digital readout of temperature, gallons of gas until empty, miles traveled, and a compass, but what sold us were the built-in car seats and the driver-side sliding door.  The car seats are easily adjusted to fit most children, I'd guess from age two until they're big enough to use regular seat belts.  

Overall, this van has been a godsend, but we have had a few problems.  Two weeks after we purchased the vehicle, a chip malfunctioned that controlled emissions, several other key components, and the shift control module.  The van was still under warranty so it cost us nothing to repair, but the chip itself would have cost hundreds of dollars to replace.   Our air conditioner has also malfunctioned and been repaired, and the brakes have developed an annoying shriek that we've had checked and told was normal for the van.  It has been a nuisance, especially since the van is not yet a year old, but we're hoping that our problems have ended.<br><br>
