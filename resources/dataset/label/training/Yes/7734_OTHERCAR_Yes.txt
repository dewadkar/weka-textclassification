            This was my first car purchase.  I have a 97 Neon Expresso 4 door.  I choose the Neon mostly because I could afford it.  The interior of the Expresso models have what they call &quot;highlights.&quot;  I call them silly rainbow things.  It's really my only real complaint with the interior.  I'm 6'1 and drive comfortably.  I've never been in the back.  The trunk space has served my needs just fine and I like that you can access it by pulling down the rear seats.  Other then the standard oil changes and suggested service I've had only one problem and that was covered under warranty.  The car has survived three accidents and continues to perform well.  I'd suggest this car to first time car buyers because of the price and good mileage.  It handles well on the highway and the city it is a bit on the noisy side but the newer Neon's have taken care of that.  <br><br>
