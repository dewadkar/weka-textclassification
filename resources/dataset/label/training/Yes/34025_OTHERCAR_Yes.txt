            <b>about myself</b>
hardly a digital photography expert, but a definite enthusiast who did plenty of research before making this final purchase.  i'm huge on saving money and buying products that will, indeed, last and last.  my last digital camera purchase was my first, and it was hardly anything comparable (it was a portable webcam by intel).  now i'm fully engrossed in the world of digital photography but am completely satisfied with the powershot s30.

<b>picture quality</b>
what good is a camera if it doesn't take good pictures, right?  the powershot s30 is great--you have three options to choose from in terms of how fine (clear) you want your pictures to be.  obviously, better quality will require more memory, and--unfortunately--the package comes with a 16mb compact flash card that you will discover to be too small all-too-quickly.  but, in terms of picture quality, whether for e-mail, web, or print, the powershot s30 will deliver.  i recall looking on cnet and finding the powershot s30 among the best in picture quality.

<b>ease of use</b>
it's quite simple to use.  essentially, you can point and click with the "auto" setting.  and for those of us who enjoy a little more challenge or creativity, you can warp prints into black and white tones, create panoramic pictures (via a stitching program installed from the CD), and even adjust aperture or shutter speed priorities.  (that kind of language, if you're unfamiliar with it, comes with having a little more experience with manual photography.)

<b>style and design</b>
this is one sexy machine.  entirely silver, the powershot s30 just looks impressive.  the lcd screen on the back is very clear--i've received so many compliments already about how good the quality is, even compared to canon's competitive "elph" line.  the camera is a little bulky, though, so if you're looking for something light and pocket-sized, go for the "elph" but understand that you are surrendering extra features, megapixels, and/or picture quality.

<b>extra features</b>
i have become a huge fan of the movie mode, which allows you to take 30-second snippets in .avi format <i>with</i> sound.  these are great if you want to capture some short video of a beautiful beach or just some of your friends dancing and drinking.  (watch out for that incriminating stuff!)  it's great also because you can playback video with the touch of a button and hear decent sound quality.

<b>gripes</b>
although nearly perfect, there are some downsides.  the battery pack drains a lot more quickly than i had initially expected.  i'm finding that i need to carry around my charger so that i'll be armed with enough battery power.  the problem may be that i keep showing off to friends the wonderful snapshots or video snippets i've taken in the past, say, week or so.  still, that's part of the digital photography experience, isn't it?

you may find, also, that transferring photos is a little cumbersome.  you don't get any kind of charger that attaches directly both to your camera and your power outlet, so you can't download photos if you run out of battery power.  i decided to purchase a compact flash reader that hooks up directly to my usb port so that i can take out the camera's memory card and download without using any battery power.

<b>in sum</b>
it's a great camera, and if you're looking for something pretty versatile and less expensive than those super-mega-thriller digital cameras that cost close to 1k, go for the powershot s30.
