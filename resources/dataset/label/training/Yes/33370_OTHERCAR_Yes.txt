            I have a 1999 New Jetta GLS that I've owned since mid April of '99.  I LOVE the car.  I'm in my mid 20's and I guess I am in a value-conscious phase of my life since this is the least expensive car I've owned since I was 18.  What I would like to stress is the VALUE, and the BEAUTY.  Granted, this car was about $2000 cheaper before the new body style, but it has many nice standard features, such as the heated mirrors, keyless entry/alarm, and the full-sized spare.  My Jetta includes a moonroof, 6 cd changer, and 16 in. wheels.  I got out the door for a little over $20,000.

Now that I've had the car for nearly 16 months, I think I know the car pretty well, though I discovered the sunshade over the rearview mirror a months after I got the car :)  The Jetta gets decent gas mileage with the 4-cylinder engine.  Though for only putting out 115 or so horsepower, you'd think you would get more of one or the other (better gas, or better horses).  I'm averaging about 340 miles per tank, with a 5-speed manual.  If I had to do it all over again, I'd wait and get the VR6 engine.  I've even seen the 1.8T on the Jetta now.  But then again, gas prices don't seem to be waning at all so I keep saving with the engine I have.  Still, the car is pretty peppy.  I can squawk the tires shifting into 2nd gear.  Just don't expect to beat any Honda Civic Si's off the line :)  0-60 is around 10sec from what I've read.

The ride is comfortable as are the front seats.  The back seats are pretty cramped for adults, but okay for short jaunts to see a movie or to the store.  The car handles well, as I learned unexpectedly one day on my commute back home from work (don't ask!).  I love the stereo system and I think the car just looks beautiful.  Mine's silver.

The dealer's that I've taken my car to so far for maintenance have been great.  I've had a 5,000 and 10,000 mile maintenance done with a 15,000 mile maintenance coming up.  I have had one little glitch when I  first bought the car.  It seems that the cord that's connected to the front passenger-side door was too tight or too loose, so that I had to pull on the handle twice to open the door.  The dealership took care of that right away though.  Also recently, on a few ocassions, the starter has hesitated when turning it over.  I'm having the dealership check it out soon.  I've had no other major problems, knock on wood, and it even performed admirably during a 2400 mile trip across the country I took.

One complaint about the cloth seats.  It picks up lint like you wouldn't believe.  Stay away from the black cloth if you can.  A high-powered vacuum wouldn't even pick up the lint from the seats.  I had to use a sticky lint roller to clean it.  Also, one complaint about the remote keyless entry system.  It sucks.  Especially the trunk lid button on the remote.  I could be standing right behind the trunk, less than a foot away and it won't open.  Both of the remotes that were included function identically.  The 2000 model does not have this problem as I found out when one of my best friends decided to buy a black 2000 Jetta VR6- ENVY!!

More standard features include, dual front-airbags and dual side-airbags, A/C, power windows with one-touch up AND down in the front, 60/40 split back seats, power mirrors, lighted vanity mirrors, 2 front cup holders, 2 rear cup holders, power outlet in ashtray and trunk, and adjustable armrest.

If you're looking for a nice German car, but don't have the money for a BMW 3-series, the Jetta is worth a look.  The interior looks nicer than any other car in this price range because of the materials used and it makes the car feel more luxurious.
