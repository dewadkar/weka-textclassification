            We bought our Mazda Protege LX new in 1993.  So far not a serious problem exists with it.  The paint still has had no problems.  We have just had to change the brakes after 88K miles.  We still get excellent gas mileage,  it runs smooth, the interior (even with 3 children)is in great shape and easily cleaned, and the over all performance of the vehicle has been above our expectations.  

We bought the vehicle after graduating college.  We loved it then for it spunk and reliability, and continue to love it just as much.  The little car has great get up and go, great gas mileage, very easy to control around corners and through obstacles.  It runs quietly and very little up keep needed to keep it in good condition.  

We have needed to oil the windows and locks when we moved to a colder and dryer climate due to them sticking. The automatic seat belts in the front were recalled becuase they wouldn't open when they needed to but a repair was done free of charge by Mazda. Other than that all else has been fine and we have been satisfied.

Anyone would benefit from owning a car like this one.  The usability is long and the auto is inexpensive to maintain.  It also has held it's resale value very well.  This is a great car for small families, a commuting spouse, college or high school student, as a main car or second car you can't go wrong.<br><br>
