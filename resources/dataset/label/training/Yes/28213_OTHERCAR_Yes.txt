            I love my Dodge Durango better than......pizza!! What did you think I was going to say? LOL!! I have owned several SUVs and the Dodge Durango is my favorite. My Durango SLT Plus is a 4 x 2 with a 5.9L Magnum V8 engine. It has fog lamps, 6 way power driver's seat, tinted windows, airbags, remote keyless entry, leather seats, AM-FM radio/cassette/CD player with eight speakers in six locations, overhead convenience group with trip computer, illuminated visor vanity mirrors and auto day/night rear views mirror and it has all the other basic things like air conditioning, power windows and locks, etc... The color is my Durango is Platinum, almost like a silver, but prettier.

My favorite feature is the third seat. I have two children, a boy and a girl, and that third seat comes in handy for trips. I have found that there is less arguing and fretting each other since we got our Durango. I also love the keyless entry. I have had this option on some of my other cars but this one works great, even through walls.

If I could change one thing about my Durango it would be......to get a 4x4 next time. I love it and would definitely buy another one!!!
