            The Mavica line of cameras are cool because they are the only cameras that use floppy disks for storage. You don't need software or cables or flash cards.

The picture quality is medium and just a little higher resolution than the Kodak DC120.

The camera also features mpeg movie making. You can take a 15 second movie that will fill up a 1.44mb floppy. The movies are cross-platform ready. All you do is put the floppy disk in your CPU and copy to your hard drive and they are ready to play.

The only drawback is the storage. Have a stack of floppies available if you plan to take some video.
