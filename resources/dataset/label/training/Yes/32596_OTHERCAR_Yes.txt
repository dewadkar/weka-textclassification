            Every Saturday night when I roll out in my green Saturn I know I'm stylin'. The car was a pleasure to buy because at Saturn there's no haggling which also means no preferential treatment for those on the inside loop. I got a CD player, leather seats, a sunroof and other amenities for a decent price. This is my first car and I couldn't be happier. Additionally, as a college student with little money, the car gets great gas mileage. It holds all my friends even though it is a bit small on the inside for taller folks. I added a spoiler to the back of the car for a suped-up look. Maintenance has been phenomenal and believe me, stuff has broken down.<br><br>
