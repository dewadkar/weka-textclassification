            I bought my 2000 Accord EX V6 in May and have been extremely happy with it. It has great power, is silky smooth, is very dependable and feels very solid. I've owned Acuras, an Infiniti, and a Nissan and the Honda is my favorite by far! Normally I like to trade cars every 2-3 years but I can see myself driving this car for many years. It has everything I want in a car. Comfort, power, features, dependability, etc. The only thing I'd change are the front seats. They could easily have more padding in the sides and lumbar area. When I first bought the car, it took me a few weeks to get used to the bland driver's seat and it's lack of support. How Honda engineers let this one slide is beyond me. But after a few months of daily driving, I'm now used to the seats and find them fairly comfortable. Overall it's a great car that will still be a great car years down the road. For the money, I honestly don't think anything can stand up to it. Especially not anything made by G.M., Ford, Chrysler, Saturn, etc. <br><br>
