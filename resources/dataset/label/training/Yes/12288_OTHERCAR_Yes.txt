            A LONG-TIME MITSUBISHI OWNER

I've been a long time fan of Mitsubishi sports cars since my high school days in the late eighties. And I've owned a few too. From the ahead of its time Starion, to the first generation Eclipse GSX with turbo and all-wheel-drive, to the second generation Eclipse GS-T front wheel drive turbo. Through the years, the Eclipse has been a great car and delivers over the top performance for less than most other Japanese manufacturers. Eclipses have received criticism for less than exemplary reliability, but in my experience driving them over the last decade, I�ve never had a break down, and problems have been few and minor. I will attest that fit and finish aren�t as good as Honda or BMW, but are far superior to any domestic car, and well worth the enjoyment of the driving experience.

NEW STYLING, NEW CHARACTER

I now own a 2000 Eclipse GT, and have to say that while the Eclipse has lost it's tried and true 4-cylinder turbo setup, it still has the ingredients for fun. The new Eclipse is a departure in style from old, featuring &quot;geo-mechanical&quot; influenced lines rather than the older wind tunnel design. It looks and feels larger than the old Eclipses, a Grand Tourer rather than a pocket rocket.

GT MODEL REALLY SHINES 

The 2000 Eclipse in it's flagship &quot;GT&quot; trim level includes a beefy naturally aspirated V6 engine and a more substantial suspension than the previous model's lighter 4-cylinder turbo. What the Eclipse lost in speed in agility it makes up for with stump pulling torque, comfort and purpose. The 205hp V6 engine gives the Eclipse an abundance of power from a dead stop to well beyond the legal speed limit. The GT comes stocked with power everything, CD radio, sport suspension, 17� alloy wheels, and fog lights. The new suspension is much more forgiving than the older cars, giving the car a more solid ride that doesn't force you to endure every bump in the road. Unfortunately, the Eclipse still has a very large turn radius, so you must plan U-turns carefully. Driving the car is very satisfying with point-and-go performance accompanied by a wonderful exhaust note, a ride that's firm without being annoying, and a pleasant interior that makes long trips enjoyable. 

INTERIOR

Inside, larger back seats help adults endure short trips but space is still at a premium (remember, this is still a sports coupe). The dashboard layout is a well designed blend of function and style.  Controls are easily reached and the silver faced gauges read clearly.  The front seats are very comfortable with adjustments for tall people that allow my 6� 4� frame fit inside an admittedly headroom-deficient car. The optional sunroof doesn't help either. The radio cluster is unique in that the display is set atop the dash while the controls are centered below near the shifter. This makes for some awkward operation but the intent is to keep your eyes near the road, and I�ve gotten used to it. 

The materials used on the interior, while stylish, appear cheap and less durable than past Eclipses. The dash is made of hard textured plastic that easily scratches. Also, the silver finish accent pieces are made from plastic - and look it. Door panels have an uninspired look that doesn't match the rest of the car and have a somewhat cheap monochromatic appearance. Of the two interior color schemes available, I think the black looks better than the beige in improving the overall look of the interior. 

In back, cargo space has been a well kept secret in the Eclipse since the 1995 models came out � why? Because it actually has space! The rear hatch area is quite deep, and with the rear seats folded down, can carry an impressive amount of cargo. I wouldn�t test it against any SUV�s but the total volume is comparable to many mid-size sedan trunks. 

DRIVING THE ECLIPSE

On the road, the Eclipse is sure footed and powerful, with torque that will press you into the seat, and handling that rewards both spirited driving and the trip to the store. When I was evaluating other new cars, I considered the BMW 328I as an option (albeit an expensive one). Driving the Eclipse GT felt eerily similar to the BMW, with power and grace and plenty of creature comforts - just like the Bimmer. 

OTHER MODELS TO CONSIDER

The new Eclipse also comes in 4-cylinder versions, specifically the RS and GS models. These models have fewer gadgets, smaller wheels, and less trim than the GT, and in my opinion they lose a lot of the bells and whistles that make a sports car rewarding. For those who value style over substance they may be attractive alternatives, but if my budget forced me to choose, I�d seriously consider other makes like the Ford Mustang, Chevy Camaro, or Honda Civic Si.

THE BOTTOM LINE

To anyone who may be in the market for a sports car, the best advice I can offer is go out the dealership and ask to drive an Eclipse GT. You will not regret it. (In my case, my exact model is a white Eclipse GT with a Sportronic (semi-automatic) transmission, 4 disc in-dash CD changer, leather interior and traction control.  Almost the same features and performance set up as that BMW 328i, yet the Eclipse was over $15,000 less). 


UPDATE - July 10, 2000

Having owned the Eclipse for almost 9 months now, I thought I'd give an update on my impressions of the car after getting used to it. Having put almost 12,000 miles on the digital odometer, I must say that the car continues to impress and please. Initial quality has largely been maintained, with the only dissappointments being a very cheap and poorly designed rear package shelf (broken and replaced twice under warranty) and the occasional lapse in operation of the keyless entry remote control. I've received two recall notices for the car - including faulty battery cable placement and a weak turn-signal stalk. Both were replaced free of charge. The Eclipse has been consistent in mileage (22 mpg city/hwy combined) and continues to drive as new. Performance minded buyers might inquire about upgrading the stock tires before buying the car, as the factory Goodyear's under-perform and audibly protest (squeal) during spirited driving.
