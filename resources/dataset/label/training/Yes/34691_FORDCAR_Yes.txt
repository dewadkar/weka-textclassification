            What a great car. I've owned a BMW 1602 European model, 3 different 60's Lotus Elans (raced one in SCCA), a 56 Bentley, a couple of Austin Healy Sprites (raced one), a low mileage 78 Cadillac Eldorado, 98 Mazda 828, etc. etc. The TBird is a better all around car than any one of them and only my Lightweight Racing Elan handled better and was faster (but it would have made a terrible street car.

I've test driven the new TBird - it costs ten times what I paid for mine with 58k miles on it, I'd rather have my 95 V8 Bird. Let's face it folks, the new one is just a Lincoln LS / Jaguar S Series with a revised engine and retrostyle body. The 90's Birds were a real Ford Motor Company engineering and design tour de force. They got it right. 

Mine had some torgue converter shudder around 40 mph with mild acceleration when I got it. A transmission power flush and refill with 14 quarts of Mercon-V ATF fixed it just fine. By next summer I'll also add the Ford recommended (for hot climates) transmission oil cooler. If you have any questions look up the Ford Technical Service Bulletins (TSB's) published in the mid-90's concerning converter shudder.
