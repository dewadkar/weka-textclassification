            OK. The chevrolet corvette defines the word fast. If you have ever wanted to know how it feels to be behind the wheel of a race car, then you have to drive a vette. I had this car for a week so I did everything possible with this thing. 1st, the ladies just did not stop. I'm 20 years old and 35-40 year old women were hitting on me. That says a lot. (sugar daddy mamma's) If you are driving this it shows you have taste and money even though it's only around $38,000. The six speed is a must. The 700R4 automatic transmition just can't release the power of the 5.7 liter like a manual. That's just common sense. They put the same tranny in the camaro. Umm hello GM there is a big difference in the vette. Anyway if you do decide to buy a vette make sure you put a mass air flow sensor in it. It will increase response by 22% and it will give you another 20-25 horse power, like you need it. I know... my uncle owns a parts place and he has a dyno tester in the back. A customer wanted to see if it worked and oh it did!! Now for the interior. Inside it is very plasticy but hey that's GM. It has ample room for the 2 of you. The gauges are nice looking but they have a cheap appeal to them. The greatest thing about the interior is the heads-up display. This means you can see a digital display of your speed in front of the car. Airlines have this in the thier jets. You want this if you plan on doing 190 mph. Your eyes don't have to leave the road. Nice insurance deduction too. If chevy works on the interior, maybe some chrome accents and white faced gauges, it will be the ultimate machine! Don't go with the convertable, i know it's tempting but it doesn't have THE LOOK with a vinal top. This is a race machine! I hope this has helped. Good luck with your new corvette!
