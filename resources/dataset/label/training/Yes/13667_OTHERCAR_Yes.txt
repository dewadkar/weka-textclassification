            About six months ago, my lease on my 1999 Lexus GS 400 was up, and I wanted a car that was fun to drive, handled well, was quick off the line, and was able to turn heads from a distance. Not only did Honda's S2000 do this, but it did it with flying colors. The S2000's amazing handling, outstanding brakes, and unreal acceleration make it one of the best car's I've ever owned, and at $33,000 that's a price I'm willing to pay.

HANDLING
The S2000's handling is excellent. I now live in Asheville, North Carolina in the Smoky Mountain's National Park, and if you're from around here, you know how curvy the roads are. The S2000 corners these roads with excellent stability. At .94 g's on the slalom skidpad, you can take most any corner with ease.

PERFORMANCE
The 240 HP four cylinder gets you up to 60 mph in a little under six seconds. And with a redline of 9000 rpm's, you have the freedom of when to switch gears without worry. Off the line, the S2000 has a bhp of 200, but at approximately 6000 rmps, the VVT-i (Variable Valve Transmission) kicks in, and off you go. To get top performance, the driver must shift at about 8500 rpm's.

BRAKING
The S2000 has four wheel, anti-lock disc brakes stoping the 2100 pound machine. These brakes will stop you in about 120 feet at a speed of 60 mph, and unbelievable feat.

OVERALL
Along with receiving the award of Most Fun Car to drive in 2000, the S2000 is a high quality vehicle delivering lots of punch, and handling. I haven't driven a car yet that has matched the S2000's "fun factor," and I've driven numerous amounts of exotic cars (i.e. ferrari, porsche, lamborghini, etc.) If you're looking for a car that's fun to drive, accelerates quickly, and sticks to the road like white on rice, then the S2000 is the car for you, and for $33,000, your wallet will thank you.
