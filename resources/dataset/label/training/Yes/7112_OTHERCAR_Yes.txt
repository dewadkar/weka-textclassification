            I purchased the car of my dreams in 1999 when I bought my emerald mica Mazda Miata and have found it a thrilling, fun car to own.

Mazda's M2 is the first major redesign of the Miata since the car's introduction to the US in 1989. The design of the car has greatly improved with the addition of a glass rear window with defroster, a short throw shifter, seemingly tighter suspension and a sleeker headlight design. The worst part of the new redesign is the placement of the cup holder in the console section of the car, making it unaccessible to passengers and cumbersome for drivers to use.

Driving the Miata is just pure fun, especially with the new shifter and the Nardi leather steering wheel. This car doesn't have an extreme amount of horsepower, hovering around 140hp, but if you're driving a manual transmission version of this car, you can get a lot of torque up to increase speed whenever necessary. I've found that I get an estimated 25MPG driving the car around town (and out in the foothills on leisurely unplanned sidetrips).

I've experienced one problem with the car since I purchased it nearly two years ago. After about 18 months I had the battery replaced (partially under warranty), as it refused to take a charge and quite suddenly completely died while I was driving down the road. It had been behaving oddly and I thought that the battery had died due to lack of use over the winter. I had the car jump started, drove it around for fifteen minutes, noting some flickering of the dash. I was driving 60MPH on a freeway when I turned on my lights because it had started to rain and the sky had gotten dark. The car instantly died, and I had to pull over to the side of the road and wait for a tow truck.

That incident is the only one that keeps me from awarding the Miata a full 5 points. It was memorably annoying and completely unlike the hundreds of other joyrides the car has given me. <br><br>
