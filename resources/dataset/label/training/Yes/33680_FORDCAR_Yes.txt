            I have been driving an Escort now for 5 years.  I love this car.  I am a college student so my finances are very tight.  The Escort is a lifesaver with it's high gas mileage ( I get roughly 35-40 miles a gallon).  I also like the look.  It is very sporty, yet it has a great deal of space for a compact car.  The trunk is very large when compared to other small cars such as the Chevy Cavalier.  It also handles very well.  The power steering and tight turning radius are great.  The sound system is also very nice with rich sound and nice bass, especially for a factory system.  One of the drawbacks to this car is its size.  I am 6'7&quot;, so getting in is a squeeze, but that comes with nearly every car.  I would also suggest getting AC for the sport model because the air circulation isn't the greatest.  Other than that I've had no complaints.  It gets me where I want to go, and without hassel or many trips to the mechanic.<br><br>
