            I always had wanted a Dodge Intrepid ever since I can remember.  I first had the opportunity to drive an Intrepid from a rent-a-car business about a year ago after having an accident.  

Immediately after driving the Intrepid for the first time, I knew it was the car for me.  I was badly shaken from my car accident.  No broken bones, just a sore, bruised body from the impact and the air bag.  For some reason, I warmed up to that car within a couple of days after my accident.  I felt relieved.  But I didn't want to rent-a-car forever.

Without hesitation after driving the rental for a week, I decided to buy one.  I called a few dealerships and couldn't touch one for under $23,500 or a hunter green Intrepid, which were all base models.  I knew that was definitely out of my price range.  That same day I went back to the doctor to make sure I was okay from the accident, a little check up.  I drove back to work and decided to make one more phone call.

Low and behold a dealership had a 1999 Dodge Intrepid that was painted Hunter Green and had options that I didn't even care about.  This one also had an upgraded wheel and tire package and power seats.  I just couldn't believe it.  

Wanna go one better...It was $4500 less than all the others and had all the options, plus my hunter green.  

It has been almost a year now since I bought it.  I have driven to Alabama and back to Missouri, plus put numerous miles on my car.  It drives well, roomy, and comfortable.  It doesn't get any better than this.......plus it is my dream come true.  <br><br>
