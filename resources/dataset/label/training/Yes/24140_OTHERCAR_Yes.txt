            Let me start by saying this was my first digital camera, but that I didn't buy it without considerable research first.  I went to several stores to test their stock, noting the qualities each had and determining which features I preferred.  Then I started looking on-line.
*****
When I took the camera out of the box, it came with 4 AA batteries, a carrying case, a mostly useless introductory video (read the manual), a power cord, two PC cables (USB and Parallel Port and a MAC adapter) and a video out.  Without touching the manual at this point, I put the batteries in and programmed the time and date and started snapping away.  I've used all kinds of regular cameras, from disposable, up to your standard fair Nikon all manual types, so I understand a little about cameras.  I learned quickly not to just push the button down to take a picture - if you push it halfway first, it focuses (and you can make sure it's focused on what you want) and then take the pic.  The AA batteries lasted for about 20-30 pics before dying, but more on that later.  Although I bought several accessories for the camera, I didn't have them yet, but fortunately, it comes with 8 MB internal memory, so a smartmedia card isn't a necessary immediate investment.

The next day, I read the manual thoroughly.  Every feature is programmable, and there are several menus, corresponding to the setting of the camera.  Most important is the SETUP menu, where the KEEP SETTINGS menu allows you to choose which active photo settings you want the camera to keep once you turn the camera off (the rest revert back to default).  After making those adjustments, the CAMERA menu (for taking pictures) has all the adjustments necessary for adjusting your pictures, from red-eye to exposure settings.  The other menus are in the playback modes, but really aren't a big to-do.

I bought 8 Ni-Mh batteries and a rapid 1 hour charger for about $40 (8 so I would always have a set of batteries to go), a Smartmedia reader for $20, and a 64 meg smartmedia card for $30 (shipping included).  For the next few days, I experimented, taking pictures of anything and making adjustments to see how to improve them.  As it turns out, the camera is adept at making the necessary changes automatically, and the settings it offers you are really there for unusual situations, but I imagine, will come in handy eventually.  When I finally took the camera on vacation, I put 4 freshly charged batteries in the camera, and took over 100 pictures, about half with flash on.  The batteries drain over time, so after about a week and 20 more pictures (120 total +/-), the battery low indicator came on.  This was surprising, in a pleasant way, because I didn't expect the batteries to last that long.  I used the LCD for every picture, but often shut it off between taking pictures, leaving the camera on.  I also learned, that like most auto-focus cameras, the manual says it sometimes has trouble focusing on soft, fluffy objects, but after taking several pictures of my 3 cats, I found that it is better than most auto-focus cameras at this.

The camera has many great features.  It has an automatic lens and LCD cover, something I hadn't seen on a camera before.  By pressing the DISPLAY button, you can turn the LCD on and off and still have the camera on, to save batteries.  Once the settings (flash, picture quality) are set (using buttons on the top of the camera), the text in the LCD window is easily turned off with the ENTER Button - this goes for playback as well.  You can set the amount of time the picture is displayed after you take it so you can determine if it's not worth keeping before it is saved to memory.  There is also a multi-pic setting, where you can take several pictures without the camera taking time to record each one.  Once I was more comfortable with the camera, I use this setting, rather than waiting to record each picture.  The digital zoom is not actively displayed, but appears as a box on the LCD to aide in framing the picture.  This is a great feature, as often when you use large zooms, it becomes difficult to find the subject once you move.  And did I mention it takes great pictures?  The color and clarity are excellent.  It also has a super-macro mode, for taking close-up pictures.  This is a great feature, especially for artistic shots and close detail.

My gripes: The viewfinder is in the center at the top of the camera, so that in order to see through it, you must press your face against the camera body.  Since the LCD is exposed (even if you shut it off) while the camera is on, you'll get oil/make-up on it or the body.  Not too big a deal, as the LCD is usually clear and easy to view in most settings.  Although, you will need to use the viewfinder in low-light settings, as the LCD isn't as sensitive as the camera and appears darker than the pictures you'll take.  I'd have preferred a viewfinder to one side of the camera.  Also, once you use the ENTER button to remove the text from the LCD, simply turning the camera off and on again brings them back, and there is no way to keep them off (big deal - press ENTER 2X).  When the flash is on, the camera takes a little longer to power up from off or to take the next picture, as it has to charge the flash (about 2-3 seconds) and it takes a little while (about 1-2 seconds) to save a picture to memory.  In the multi-picture mode, it takes about 5-10 seconds, but that's after 5-10 pictures, depending on their compression.  Also, the battery low indicator only comes on as a warning at the end of the battery life, rather than a constant indicator of how the batteries are handling - but as I wrote earlier, at well over 100 pictures, this isn't really necessary.  Lastly, when the batteries are removed from the camera, there is only 3 minutes of reserve power to remember the time and date.  While this is sufficient to replace the batteries, when you store the camera for a week or more, you should remove the batteries and therefore need to reset the time when you start again.  I would have liked a small lithium wafer battery for this purpose.

Well, if you're still reading, you see that overall, the camera has far more pluses than not, and that, as I learned, most of the negative reviews were the result of not reading the manual (it goes quick and can be done within an hour).  I prefer the media card reader rather than hooking up the camera because it's more direct and you don't need to be hooking the camera up to the computer.  So, if you're looking, stop - it's truly a great camera and after 3 weeks and nearly 250 pictures, I'm very pleased.

I bought it refurbished for $300 online at electronet distributors.

As an additional note, added later, I went abroad recently and took the camera.  I took along 4 sets of charged batteries and a total of 128 megs of SM Cards for a 12 day trip.  (The charger I have won't work, even with a converter)  I took over 300 pictures and nearly filled the cards before going on to the third set of batteries.  Certainly not a bad deal.  This isn't much extra to carry, and fit in the front pouch of a small camera bag.
