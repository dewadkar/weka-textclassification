            The 2000 Pontiac Sunfire is among the least expensive of all new cars, yet comes nicely equipped, is well powered, and is great fun to drive.

The back seats fold down to create more cargo space. The engine is 2.2L standard and feels great, probably due to the low weight of the car and the fact that mine is a stick-shift. It comes standard with child-car-seat anchors. I went on a long trip recently and got 32 mpg at an average of 70 mph!

I find that compared to its competitors, it is a great deal. It feels more sturdy than the Honda Civic, yet is cheaper, and has almost as good of a reliability record, according my own personal experience, and various auto reviewers, like Edmund's. It looks a little sportier than the otherwise identical Chevy Cavalier. It feels more luxurious than the cheaper and underpowered Saturn. The Hyundai has serious reliability issues. 

After reading the other reviews of this car, I must say: If you gave this car a negative review, what car, for a similar price, would you recommend instead? So many reviewers complain about this or that...but is there another car in it class that is any better? Only if you can point to an alternative should you criticize a product.<br><br>
