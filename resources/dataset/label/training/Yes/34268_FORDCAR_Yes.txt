            Ford has been the chosen manufacturer for all of the cars provided by the company my husband works for.  Having come from a Ford Windstar van, I have to say he was a little concerned about how the F150 would ride, especially since he puts about 4,000 miles per month on his vehicles.  The van wasn't the most macho company car he'd ever had, but at least it was comfortable for all those hours on the road.

Surprisingly, though, the F150 SuperCab has been a dream.  Not only does it have enough room for the two of us, it also has room for the baby's carrier in the back seat (which makes us feel much safer when we have to take her with us in this vehicle).

This truck has a powerful V-8 engine, and an extremely smooth ride.  Gas mileage is average, and yes, the higher octane fuel helps with the pinging (typical of every Ford product we've ever driven).  It is equipped with ordinary features such as AM/FM Cassette, power windows, cruise, tilt, etc. (no bells and whistles on a company car...but no payment either!)  The best thing about this truck, though, is the ability to utilize 4-wheel-drive.  We are having one of the worst winters in years, and without this feature, we couldn't even make it out of our driveway.  

Our only complaints with this vehicle have to do with aesthetics.  When Ford redesigned this model, they were committed to making it bigger...well, they did!  It is almost obnoxiously big.  We have a very spacious 2-car garage and this thing takes up more than its fair share of that space.  Also, it is very high off the ground requiring two steps to get into it.  Once inside, though, the view is fantastic!  

This truck is dependable, and is the best truck we've ever used for hauling materials.  We have hauled furniture, landscaping mulch, farm animals, hay, and lots of other things in this truck, and have been very thankful for the sturdy design of the bed.  I know other people have commented on the poor quality of the paint on this truck, but that has not been our experience.  We have had it on hundreds of construction sites, and haven't even had as much as a scrape.

Although we're not true Ford fans, we would recommend this truck based on our own experience.<br><br>
