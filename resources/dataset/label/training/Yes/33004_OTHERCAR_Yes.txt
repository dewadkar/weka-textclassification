            I have always owned cars until we bought a 99 GMC Sierra in August.  I was VERY skeptical and didn't want it.  We were moving to a rural area (we're in Alaska) and I was going to be driving 100 miles ONE WAY three days a week so my husband wanted me in something &quot;big&quot;.  This truck drives like a car with all the truck pluses!! It's like driving a really BIG, TOUGH car!  The push button AUTO 4 wheel drive is WONDERFUL!  Alaskan roads can be slippery in parts and fine in others, Auto 4 wheel drive can handle it all!  The extended cab is roomy in the back seat as well as the front, comfortably fitting 4 adults.  The fold down console/arm rest/storage area is my favorite part!  It is big enough to hold a NUMBER of CD's, a cell phone, and various other &quot;necessities&quot;.  It makes driving the truck more comfortable with a place to rest your right arm, as well as easily folding up to make room for another passenger.  The easy fold up and down rear seat is also user friendly!  I can easily move the seat myself, without assistance from anyone.  The only thing I would suggest they do different is put the third door on the drivers side, it would be SO much more convenient there!  Maybe I'm lazy, but I hate having to walk all the way around to the other side!  Oh! My other 'big thing' about this truck I love is the keyless entry.  It is SO nice to just push a button to unlock the door or relock them, especially if your hands are full.  It is also nearly impossible to lock yourself out of this truck when it's running!  You have to PHYSICALLY put the key in the door to lock it.  One other thing I would change...the cup holders, make them more sturdy, they tend to bounce too much and then your drink gets splashed all over the radio/heater controls.  I would recommend this truck to anyone, single guy, married family.  It is easy to get in and out of, it has room, it's reliable, and it's great to drive!
