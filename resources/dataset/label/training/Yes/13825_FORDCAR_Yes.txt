            I like my Contour SVT, but it's not perfect.

Pros:  The car is fast and quiet on the freeway.  Around town, the engine growls enough to let you know it's there.  The sound of the engine is addictive-a multicam V-6 snarl that's much better than the radio.  Also, the car handles like it's on rails.  I have yet to find this car's limits, despite pushing it as hard as possible.  Also, there are no squeaks or rattles.  And if you like being part of the crowd, this car has a huge following, complete with lots of support from contour.org .  There are mailing lists and a couple of companies that make aftermarket parts for the Contour.

Cons:  The shifter/clutch relationship is horrible.  Driving this car smoothly is a chore that is exacerbated by overly flexible engine mounts.  This can be cheaply cured with aftermarket polyurethane mounts, but you'll get engine vibration as a trade-off.  Also, the seats are tough to get comfortable in, despite having multiple adjustments.  And while the seats are called leather, and they look like expensive, perforated leather, they smell like shower curtains.  The cows they used for these seats had a much higher vinyl content than the cows used for other cars.  While this is nothing a good air freshener can't fix, the lack of a true leather aroma stinks.  The gas mileage isn't as good as I'd like either.  You have to rev the living day light out of the engine to get to the powerband, and this takes fuel--lots of it.  But the revs are their own reward, again with a sound straight from heaven and a smooth rush of power.  Expect 20-23 mpg around town and 27-30 on the highway.  Stay in 5th gear, whenever possible, around town, and you can actually get 27 mpg in the city.  But this is tough. <br><br>
