            When I first started looking for cars I never pictured myself in a "grandma car"  not even a 4 door car. I was thinking more like sport BMW, but i was wrong and this car is great. I bought it in 2001 from a private seller for $2500 what a steal for me. It has a 3.5L 215 horsepower engine which can force all those little punks who drive around speeding thinking they're so cool to eat your dust, you also have the option to not be like me and drive aggresively. The leather interior was in pretty rough condition when I got it but with a little leather cleaner it looks brand new. The Infinity Stereo with Cd is great for those people who want quality sound but doesn't want to pay high prices to put them in. The power antenna ,boy oh boy this is so helpful there is nothing I like more than going to a car wash and unscrewing those manual antennas so they won't break while your getting a wash, but with the power ones I just push the button and it goings down no effort taken. The trunk is giant, when I first got the car I had to drive 400 miles to get it I had family around there so I stayed a while, I packed 4 suitcases, 3 pairs of shoes, and a uhaul box of past memories all in that truck. Best of all get one with a alarm or keyless entry, must of them have truck release and that is a big help since the truck release in the car is in the glove box.
