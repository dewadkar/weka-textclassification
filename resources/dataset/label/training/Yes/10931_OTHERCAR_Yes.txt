            I don't want to rehash all that's been said about this car. I agree with most of the comments.

Here's my point of view after driving almost 19,000 miles in 11 months.

I still love this car!!! I commute 80 miles with it round trip daily and I've taken it up in snow to Lake Tahoe.

It's still as quiet as when I first got it. I have had no problems with it and have had only 1 scheduled maintenance. I have one coming up in about 3000 miles.

The only down-side is I wish I could try out the sport seats. The sport seats are not an option with the Premium Package so sometimes, when I take some sharp turns and don't slow down too much, I tilt a little too much.

Also, I think my sunroof needs to be reprogrammed. Sometimes, I have to open to close. (Does that make sense?)

One possible upgrade in a future car for me would be 4 wheel drive. I hear BMW is coming out with a 4WD version in the future.<br><br>
