            After getting burned on my last vehicle purchase, I spent a year researching vehicles.  It came down to the Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester or Legacy Outback.  I loved the Outback but just had to get over the station wagon stigma.  Let me just say flat out that this is NOT your father's Country Squire!  It's just like Paul Hogan states in the commercials.  Driving the Subaru Outback is like hopping into a rally car.  The car is really fun to drive in the pouring rain or during a blizzard (no joke:).  I went cheap and got a metallic silver base model with a CD player and cold weather package as the only options.

This car is a true &quot;sport utility&quot; vehicle.  You get great handling and cornering thanks to the low mounted H-4 engine.  The ride height is perfect and the driver's seat can be height adjusted to give you a commanding view of the road.  The 4 cylinder may not be a powerhouse but it still has an impressive 165hp and a much better power to weight ratio than most SUV's.  If you want a sports sedan but need the room and utility of a truck, this is the vehicle for you since you can opt for a great 5 speed manual transmission.  This vehicle sips gas when compared to a 2 ton SUV and the braking with the 4 wheel discs and ABS is great.  If any of you have owned an SUV with &quot;part-time&quot; 4WD, you will greatly appreciate Subaru's AWD system.  All wheel drive is vastly superior for the type of conditions most people face on the road.  Leave 4x4 for the off-roaders.

The cons?  Well, there aren't many.  The seats are a bit firm.  I've driven about 5 hours nonstop but I don't mind firm seats.  The way the outback roof is raised, it makes it impossible to get a power sunroof, as well.<br><br>
