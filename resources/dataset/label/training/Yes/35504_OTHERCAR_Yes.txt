I have to admit up front: I love Honda's.  When I heard
that they were coming out with a minivan to compete with
a Chrysler I was interested in it.

Like everyone else who got an Odyssey, we had to wait about
6 months.  On balance it is a great car.  It rides well, gets
good acceleration (for a mini van), and we love the fold down
rear seat.

Also like almost everyone else, we've had trouble with the
doors.  Not as bad as some (they didn't open while driving!)
but sometimes they don't shut right.  I've heard this has
been fixed in the 2000 model year.

The car is big with lots of room.  Like most cars it lacks
interior storage, but no worse than most other cars.  It
has &quot;lots&quot; of cup holders, but they don't hold cups well.

Net result: we're very happy with it.<br><br>
