            When Honda released the New 5th generation Accord in 1998 I was the first one at the dealership waiting to sit inside one of these beauties.  With absolutely no intention to buy this car, two weeks later I found myself behind the wheel of my very own Accord.  How could I pass up a chance to own a car such as this?  That was when I realized for the first time that this wasn't your ordinary 4-door sedan.  Honda was now my new GOD, for they created a &quot;road-ship&quot; unlike any other, A car that still gets my heart racing every time I step foot into it. 

     When you step on the gas the car jumps to life. The clamed 0-60mhp in 9.5 sec. is truly a false statement.  With my 4 cylinder Vtech EX Accord I have easily accomplished this in under 8.0 sec.  After all this is the most important feature! Isn't it?  If you do not think so, please do not worry! For Almost every feature on this Car is flawless. For instance the way this Car handles.  The Steering is precious with Over-steer only in the most extreme turns. My father compared the steering to his C300 Mercedes. The Transmission is smooth and quiet. Putting it in 2nd gear will keep you sucked to your seat in the back roads when youï¿½re having a little fun. I have had my car up to 70mph in 2nd gear without hitting redline.

    For comfort, Honda went all out on their Flagship Sedan.  The Leather seats are very comfortable, and will take you 300 miles without a backache.  The controls are positioned in the right places, and the fit and finish of both the interior and exterior are quite surprising.  All this in a car that will seat 5 adults very well and will give you 250,000+ trouble free miles, and is priced under 23,000 bucks.  How can you go wrong? Maybe this is why Honda sold over 300,000 Honda Accords in 1998.  Maybe this is why 1 in every 10 cars that passes by is a Honda Accord.  Remember the Majority is always right. Go out and test-drive this car today!
