            I told my wife that she could but any vehicle she wanted.  I went into sticker shock when we went shopping.  Having owned a 1998 50th Anniversary 4.0 for over a year, my opinion has changed drastically.  This is the most well-built, capable vehicle I have ever driven.  It has the ride of a Jaguar with (nearly) the off-road capabilities of a Hummer.  The dealer puts on a &quot;clinic&quot; annually where you can challenge your Rover.  That shows you what your car can do off road in a stone quarry.  I was completely impressed.  The Rover went over logs, through mud, through rock fields and on a teeter-totter effortlessly.  

The dealers are geared to 100% customer satisfaction.  They pick my car up at my house (60 miles from the dealer) and leave a loaner EVEN FOR AN OIL CHANGE!!!.  So far, in 40,000 miles there have been ZERO problems with the Rover.  It's a great looking, great running, comfortable (my wife drives three hours one-way to work once a week) vehicle that can go almost anywhere backed by great people.  I would not hesitate to buy another one (I really want a Defender).  My only regret is that my wife gets to drive it every day and I do not.  A year ago I would have told you that Range Rovers are a waste of money.  Now I am a fan.<br><br>
