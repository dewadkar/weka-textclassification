            After literally ONE FULL YEAR of S.U.V. studies and test drives of various models, I decided on a '99 Mountaineer. Overall, I've been pleased with my judgement. I got rid of (not traded... got rid of!!!) a '94 Plymouth Grand Voyager mini-van and... well, how about I tell you about THAT vehicle in a separate review.<br>Let's talk about the good stuff! The Mountaineer is a great car for people who want the height, weight and feel of road superiority that often comes with driving a &quot;truck&quot; versus a &quot;car&quot;, but who also want the smooth, cushy ride of a luxury car. Mountaineer's ride is &quot;smooth&quot;, but not &quot;soft&quot;. It reminds me of an old Rolls Royce-kinda ride.<br><br>It's also great for small families like:<br>* Mom, Dad and 3 small to medium kids or<br>* Mom, Dad and 2 large kids or<br>* Mom, Dad, one in-law, 1 large kid or 2 small kids<br>* Mom and Dad by themselves<br>* Mom OR Dad by herself or himself<br>* Single parents of any gender<br>* and either size family with 1 or 2 small to mid-size pets<br><br>It's also great for single guys and gals (non-Moms and non-Dads with NO in-laws or kids) who like panache and roominess in the same vehicle because it's a good-looking car with sufficient interior room to stretch out and be comfortable. <br><br>Okay, now the not-so-good stuff! In less than 1 year, I've put over 21,000 miles on it in Philadelphia and on the road with gas mileage ranging between 9 and 18 m.p.g. I've got the (very thirsty) V-8 and I spend roughly $50 per week in gas. My insurance costs, however, are actually lower with this than the mini-van I had.<br><br>I, like others have reported, do have an engine knock (the manufacturer says use 87 octane, the cheap stuff), but 89 tends to keep things a bit quieter. Don't use 93 or 94 at all... a waste of money!!!! <br><br>I also have an intermittent problem: the engine accelerates on its own while I'm at a dead stop with brakes applied... it sounds and feels like one foot's on the gas while the other's holding the brake... the engine's RPMs rev to 2 or higher, but the sensation is spontaneous and lasts only a few seconds. The dealer has no clue how to identify or fix the bug and the V.P. at Mercury never answered my letter.<br><br>Other than that, it's a real swell machine. <br><br><br><br>
