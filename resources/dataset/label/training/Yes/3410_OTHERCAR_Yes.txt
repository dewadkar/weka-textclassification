            I love my Chevy Suburban!!   I can not rave enough about it.  

It seats 9 very comfortably, with room in the back for luggage, groceries, or even a washing machine!!

The gas tank is huge 42 gallons I believe so your not bothered,with frequent fill ups.

Rear air conditioning to keep the passengers all the way back cool!

A built in jack hidden in the back compartment, complete with gloves!

A light under the hood that is removable to get down into the tight spots.

The back seat is completely, removable for extra room, and the middle seat has two different ways to fold down.

I feel so safe in it, even if I were to get in an accident I am confident that my family would stay safe.<br><br>
