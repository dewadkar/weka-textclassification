            Actually the 1998 Firebird Trans Am I will attempt to review is my wife's car. The styling is too gaudy for my tastes. We've owned close to a dozen Firebirds since the mid 70's and it's the only car my wife would even consider buying.
Positives: The obvious is awesome power. This car generates 305 horsepower and does 0 to 60 in less than 6 seconds. Not too many cars can match it's performance except for newer Vettes and the Dodge Viper and other exotic cars.
Actually price is very reasonable considering we paid around $25,000 and today most pickup trucks and SUVs cost that much. We got every option available except the Ram air option on the car. T-tops, leather, CD changer, power windows, seats, locks, air, cruise, tilt etc.. Go out and buy an SUV today with those option and you are probably looking at $30,000. I realize it's two different segments of the market, but do you know how often I hear someone tell me I must be rich to have a Trans Am when they're driving a Ford Expedition or Chevy Blazer which costs at least as much? 
Resale value is excellent also. We paid about $25,000 for the car 3 years ago and could easily get $20,000 for it now. Conversely, I have a 2000 Altima that I paid $21,000 for 18 months ago that is worth about $12,000 now. Pretty sad.
Fit and finish is pretty good for an American car. The paint is excellent and the tolerances are exact.
Negatives: Only uses premium gas which adds 20 cents a gallon to the cost of a fill up. Fuel economy isn't really too bad if you drive it sensibly. 20 MPG is about the norm which is also better than most SUVs and trucks get.
One negative for me is the closed in feeling I get driving the car. Visibility sucks and the front windshield is so sloped it feels claustrophobic. 
The car is lousy in snow, which is why it sits in our garage for 6 months every year. Traction control helps but it's still a rear wheel drive muscle car and they are not meant for winter driving.
Strong rumors have it that GM will drop the model after the 2002 season which is kind of sad. There aren't many sport coupes out there with this kind of power at a fair price. What you're left with is every conceivable type of SUV/Truck and a bunch of boring front wheel drive sedans that look like they came off the same drawing board.
