            This camera rocks what can I say. The big brother of the Canon D30 3 megapixel camera. Uses the same batterys the d30 uses which is good since they are so long lasting and seem to be very good on battery life and rechargeable.
Compact flash cards and microdrives accepted.
interchangeable with any of the canon ef autofocusing lenses.
Same layout and design as the D30.
larger megapixels 6.3 to be exact.
Able to make 11x14's and 16x20s with no problem. I have personally printed several 30x40's with the help of genuine fractals from this camera for posters for commercial displays. I am a professional nature photographer who also does commercial work and weddings on the side. The image quality is amazing.
better autofocusing than the d30
still only 3 focusing points
this camera looks identicle to the d30 witha  few exceptions the wordl digital on the camera now and the newly designed rubber covers for the external shutter release and file transfer cable which is a well liked addition. The new design of the cover is attached so that you dont loose the little rubber covers. Very nice design.

Also canon gave you a light for the top diplay lcd so that low light or night shooters can see the apeture and shutterspeeds hit a button and it lights up very nice.

Long time exposures from the d60 are nearly noise free
anyone that has used a digital camera for exposures longer than 30 seconds knows that noise becomes an issue same with high iso settings like 800 1000 or more. The Canon D60 has a noise reduction built in and is amazing. I am able to do night time shots at iso 1000 for over 30 seconds and no noise is visiable. That is quite impressive especially for astrophotographers.
Zoom borwser the software that comes with the camera has been upgraded from the d30 but still awfully slow. Try Breezebrowser from Chris Breeze a much faster and better designed program.
Reccomended for professional ameture or newbies wanting to get serious into digital photography. For the average person they should never have to buy another digital camera unless you want to print billboards.
