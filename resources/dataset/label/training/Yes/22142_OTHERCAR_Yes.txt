            I was searching for a digital camera that I could afford. I never expected that I could get one of this caliber. The dc215 zoom millenium edition takes big(1152x864 res), great quality pictures. It comes with more memory than most cards offer, 8mb(which can fit 26 of the highest quality and highest resolution pictures possible), and it even includes the memory card reader so you don't have to transfer your pictures slowly through the included cable. It has 2x optical zoom, which means you can zoom 2x without losing any quality as in digital zoom. The millenium edition also comes with a cord to hook up the camera to your TV to view the pictures on a big screen. Other digital cameras that I looked at with most of these features were $400+. The only things bad about this camera is that there is a kind of a long delay between shots and the batteries are usually used before your second fill of shots, but this can be remedied by buying the ac adapter and/or rechargeable batteries.<br><br>
