            Hi,

and thanks for choosing to read my review.

I own a 1997 Saab 900 S, 3 door coupe, manual (no turbo).
I purchased this car used from a dealer (Shaw Saab, in Hingham, MA).  It had about 48,000 miles, but it was still perfect.

Ok, about the car... 
In the first place, this is a very beautiful car.  Its unique lines make it stand out from any and every car you will pass on the street.  While it is a very common car in a city like Boston, on a recent road trip, I was getting looks and thumbs up from passerbyï¿½s on the street when they saw the car.  Its not a car people see all the time.

The inside of the car is laid out with so much logic, its perfect.  Things are where they should be.  The radio on top, ac-heat below.  All the important controls are very easily accessible.  And the car has a &quot;Black Panel&quot; feature, which is great.  You can turn off the illumination on all of the gauges (except the speedometer).  When I first heard of this, I thought &quot;ok, thats cute... but I want to know whats going on with the car...&quot;.  On a long nighttime drive, I actually used this feature... all I can say is wow.  If any one of the gauges begins to show a problem (low gas, high temp, etc), that gauge will become illuminated, and the computer will alert you to it.  Also, all the fog light switches, which glow brightly when you switch the item on, are located so that they are hidden behind the steering wheel, so you can reach them easily, but they don't blind you at night, and to look at them just tilt your head.

Next, the car has some really small, thoughtful touches which to me is TRUE luxury, not extra leather or a wood dash...  there is a small indentation in the center console, for the key fob to rest in while the key is in the ignition.  The seat can be adjusted in any and every way.  The ac-heat controls are easy to understand... and even when you have it set on defrost, a little air is still sent to the dash vents, so that you don't feel cold.  There are window defrost vents for the front and rear side windows, and there is even a vent for the rear passengers... and the seat heaters are GREAT on long trips... its like a massage...

Which brings me to my next point...  this car is SO quiet at high way speeds...  its eerie...  I feel that I have to force myself to speak more softly in the car, since I realize I am accustomed to shouting whenever I am on the highway in other cars...  The car has great lights, and has a rear fog light, very nice.  There are interior lights everywhere... and they are simple and effective.  Lots of storage places.. even some hidden ones, which I won't mention here (you can have fun finding them...).  The car is very roomy for its size, and a great road trip car.

The cars radio has an amazing range, I can pickup radio stations (FM stations) from about 100 miles away at times, and it has WX band (weather band) too, which is useful. 

The car, even w/ out the turbo, is has lots of torque...  I have driven an rx-7 for 6 years, and I thought that when I got this car, I would be &quot;bored&quot;...  This Saab is quick.  The non-turbo has more than enough power to cut through traffic, in the city or the highway.  I can only imagine what the turbo is like...  On another note,  the car gets great gas mileage.  About 20 city, and about 28 ~ 32 mpg on the highway... very good, and with a 18 gal. tank, you can easily go 400 hwy. miles without stopping (just plan for bathroom breaks...)
Also, the car handles very well, at speed, or even around town.  Its no Porsche, but you have great road feel, without a harsh ride.  You barely feel bumps and cracks, but you know whats happening under you...

The fit in finish in this car is also very good, thats all I can say.  If its perfect, why elaborate?  No squeaks... nothing loose...  perfect.

Hmmm.. what else can I say?  If you live in the Boston area, may I suggest you call Shaw Saab in Hingham, amazing service, very nice people, a great experience.

Well, thats all for now...
Good luck, and let me know if you get a Saab!  Post your opinion here!
Phillip
