            I got this camera for about $130 when it was being discontinued;  I got the floor model.  I think it was selling for about $250 in its day.

Well, as a 2 megapixel camera, it's now a dinosaur, isn't it?  Not really.

We took some pictures on vacation, and blew them up to 8x10's.  (Printed them on the high-quality photo paper on a fairly inexpensive HP printer.)  They were FLAWLESS!  They look so good that I can study them with a magnifying lens and not see any blemishes.  So I'm very pleased.  I never expected this from a 2 megapixel camera.  Resolution, color balance, sharpness, contrast...I'm telling you, these pictures make you feel like you're looking at the real thing.

This camera is far from perfect, though.  The downsides:

--The flash is harsh and has a very short range.  Way too bright at short range, then suddenly drops off to nothing.  Everything behind your subject is in deep shadow.
--The camera is slow.  It takes a couple seconds to take a picture after you hit the button.  That's partly the camera, and partly the memory.  I got some fairly fast memory--and the camera is still slow.
--The menu system is clunky and hard to use, and worse, hard to remember.  I'm slowly getting it, but it's annoying.
--In bright light, the LCD viewfinder is *very* difficult to use.  If you have the sun behind you, it's utterly useless.  You can adjust its brightness level, but it's still useless in direct sunlight.
--In medium light situations, the performance is unpredictable.  I took some sunset pictures of my kids where one would turn out very nice and another would be worthless.  It's hard to know which will work.
--The 16MB memory that comes with the camera is not nearly enough.  Plan on getting a much bigger one.  I got a 256MB, which means I can take about 120 pictures.  Also pick up a spare battery.  Battery life is pretty good, but not great.  I can generally take somewhere between 20-40 pictures before the battery dies.

These are mostly quibbles, though.  (But if you take lots of pictures in broad daylight, the LCD viewfinder may drive you crazy.)  Overall, this camera is small, lightweight, easy to use if you don't have to change a lot of settings (i.e., if you just turn it on, point, and click), and it takes simply fabulous pictures in excellent light.  And as I write this, you can get it for $100.  That's a real bargain.  If you just want to test the digital camera waters, and don't want to spend too much...or you want to get a camera for your kid, but you're worried about giving him/her too expensive of a toy that might be easily broken...this might be the camera for you.
