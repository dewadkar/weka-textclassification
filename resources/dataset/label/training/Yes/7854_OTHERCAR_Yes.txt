            I just bought my 2001 Steel Gray 330Ci.  It has the sport, premium, and cold weather packages, Xenon's, and 5 spd.  It has 55k miles on it, but you would never know it.  I drove almost everything in the sport-luxury area.  NOTHING comes close to this car.  I thought the 328 I drove was sweet until I drove a 330.  The engine is so smooth and has an absolutely perfect growl.  I was shopping for a used Audi S4 for a long time and wasn't even considering BMW.  After driving the 328 I knew I wanted one.  The day after I drove the 328 I saw a late model Audi A4 broke down on the side of the road.  Kinda made me stop and think...  "Have I ever seen a BMW on the side of the road?"  Answer = No.
The S4 is a nice car, but its power seems somewhat contrived and the turbo lag while short is still noticeable.  I scared the crap out of the Carmax guy when I nailed it in the S4.  He didn't have a clue what the car could do.  By the way, if you have a Carmax near you I highly recommend going there for your test drives.  I drove 12 different cars in 3 hours.  When I drove the 328 the power is there at the start right through to the red line.  My buddy likes to say it has "balls".  That about sums it up (my apologies to the female readers...).
My buddy also told me NOT to drive a 330 because I would want one.  Well, I fell for a dealers up sale on a 330 and took it out.  Oh my god!  The 330 is the perfect car.  Ultimate Driving Machine... AMEN.  I have never driven anything else like it.  You feel like you're on rails.  The power pushes you back in your seat until you let off.  You don't ride *over* the road, you're *on* the road.  You can feel everything that's going on, but you're not subjected to anything harsh.  The exhaust note and engine growl make me want to drive 24 hours a day.  In fact, I went out driving tonight at 10:30 just because I hadn't driven it today (I start a new job Monday).  
If you can find a clean used BMW go for it.  I was originally shopping for Celicas and Mustangs, but a signing bonus with the new job gave me an extra 5 grand to plunk down on my new sport's car, so I upgraded.  Boy did I.  I got my car for a steal.  It will need new tires in the front and 3 out of the 4 sport rims are boogered up, but I got it for $6K less than a dealer would have charged.  I&#146m either going to have the stock sport rims chromed or I&#146ll put some after-market&#146s on, so it doesn&#146t bother me.  I didn't get an owner's manual either, but I've already ordered one with the local dealer ($33) and it should be here in a couple days.  Then maybe I can figure out how to set the clock.
