            I bought my 95 Aurora Olds used this last summer (MAY 99).  I had a 94
Camaro, and thought I would like to change to the new Malibu or a
Monte Carlo.  I knew nothing about the Aurora, and bought it without
doing any research.  I bought it from the original owner who had low
miles, and had kept the car very clean.  I fell in love with the
interior and smooth ride.  It was very nice having SO much room in the
front and back seat.  I just this week, Jan of 2000 had the water
pump replaced, which was 300.00, but it was the first repair it has
needed to date.  I figure I could have bought a new car for more money,
and not have repairs yet, but it has been worth it for me.  The cars
I had been looking at before this can't compare to the luxury of this
car. I think anybody that is looking for a big car, that is still
VERY sporty should look into this car.  You can't go wrong.  
The heated seats make the winter months a litter nicer driving,
especially since they get nice and warm before the heater kicks in!!!
(one complaint- when the low fuel light comes on- you are about to run
out of gas!!!!!!)<br><br>
