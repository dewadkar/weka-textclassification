            I bought a Focus after I totaled my 93 Tercel that had 238,000 trouble free miles on it.  (Thank God I survived).  I had been watching the Focus and when it became necessary to buy a new car I looked at one, test drove it, and was convinced that it was a good replacement for the Toyota.  
It has plenty of room, enough power and is getting gas mileage in the mid-thirties (if you don't push it real hard).  I purchased an automatic (because my right arm is still recovering from the accident) and it always is in the gear I need it to be. Quite an improvement from my last 4 cylinder/AT experience. I would recommend the Focus if you need an economical car that handles well, has plenty of room for four six foot plus folks and their luggage.  The car feels real solid too, so it should last for a while.<br><br>
