            To answer the question of if it is a nice car or a really ncie car or a wanna be is very tough. It really is all on what you think of it, its all in your hands. Whta I am going to do is tell yuo waht I thinbk of it and why I like it and dont like it. I mkay be a little picky but prolly not, but itsd all up to you. As usuall I would like everybody who reads my epinion to post a comment about it so I can see what I am doing write or wrong in each of my epinions. Thank you very much. Back to the 4runner. I have three ideas about it, and I will tell you about each one.


1) The durablity of this car is fantastic. I am into mountain biking and I loove to bring this car when trying to find trails or going off roading. If you are the kind of person that likes that kind of stuff, i really do suggest you try this car. Take it for a test drive and it feels great. It has very nice room in it to keep lots of things. For instance I keep my bike in their usually, and my bike appliances such as spare iner tubes and things like that. It is a very roomy car for that reason and I suggest purchasing it for that reason.



2) It is a toyota. Thats all I have to say, If you read many of my reviews you know how I feel about Toyota cars. They are Fantastic cars. You can get great miles on this car, with out fixing it up often or anything like that. I love this car for that reason mainly because it lasts for me and it always comes through when I need it too.


3) The driving. If you are the kind of person that likes a car that is very manuverable and quick. I wouldn't suggest this car. It is small for an SUV but still isn't as quick as I wish it was. But it is a Toyota and it does last a long time and it can take a beating off road.<br><br>
