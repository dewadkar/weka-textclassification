            I used to own a Ford Taurus ('96).  She was my first baby and I loved her.  However, when my husband and I moved to a city that was 1 hour away from work, we needed a new car that didn't guzzle gas like it was water.

We spent a good few months researching using the Lemon-Aid Guide (a wonderful book) and finally decided on the Honda Civic EX 2000 model.  It was a wonderful ride - the double-wishbone suspension provides a wonderfully smooth ride.  Since we were going from a rather large car to a smaller one, I was worried about the interior room.  I was very nicely surprised.  This car is roomy and can store a lot in both the trunk and the back seat.

The car is fairly quiet - a lot quieter than her cousin the Acura 1.6EL - that's more of a sports car in my opinion.

There are also some great little bonuses in the base model:

1 - exterior mirror defrost - I live in Canada and over the winter it's a real pain to scrape the side mirrors - this is a wonderful feature!

2 - Baby seat clips in the back - this is wonderful and my husband and I hope to put it to good use in the future.

3 - Split back seat - the split back seat is wonderful for those extra large packages.

4 - Middle console storage - the console between the driver and passenger has a small compartment - perfect for storing stuff out of the way.

In general, if you are looking for a very nice, comfortable car with good gas mileage (best is around 90 km/hr) and you have a family of 2 - 4, this car is a good deal.  Anything more than 4 people and the car is cramped and can't hold that many people.

I'm very pleased with the car and with the service staff at my local Honda dealership.<br><br>
