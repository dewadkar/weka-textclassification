            If you were looking for a sporty high performance car, I'd have to tell you that a '93 Corolla may not be exactly what you were looking for.  But if you were looking for a simple, but reliable car which was nice to drive, I'd tell you to give the Corolla a good look.

Starting with the interior, the manufacturers have kept it pretty simple.  The seats are covered in a soft grey material and are of a good size.  There is plenty of leg room in the front, but the back seat would leave anyone over 5 feet tall feeling a bit cramped.  It's also a great car for tall people as there is a great deal of head room.  The trunk looks decievingly small from the outside; inside of it can fit a great deal of cargo.

The steering on the Corolla is pretty nice, and the brakes have never caused a problem.  ABS is a standard feature on the '93 model and having needed it a few times, I'd say it works pretty well.  Gas mileage on this car is great - it will definitely save you a bit of money.

This car was designed mainly for family purposes as its engine is pretty basic - 1.6 L engine, 4 cylinders, 115 horsepower.  It accelerates pretty well for this, but don't expect it to be at highway speeds in 4 seconds.  The only odd thing I've noticed about the Corolla is its reluctance to switch to 4th gear - upon moving it readily shifts itself up to 3rd (I have an automatic transmission by the way) but takes quite a long time to shift up to 4th, leaving me telling my car "c'mon hon, do yourself a favor and switch up!".

Reliability is the Corolla's best feature.  In eight years, this car has not given me any trouble.  The standard dealer checkup has kept this car in good shape.  I was surprised to find out that it also doesn't seem to need oil changes all that often.  Along with the good gas mileage, this car, though slightly more expensive upon buying it, will make up for it by barely costing a thing in repairs, maintenance, etc.

Finally, to anyone who is looking for a well made, reliable car which is a pleasure to drive, I recommend that you take a second look at the '93 Corolla.
