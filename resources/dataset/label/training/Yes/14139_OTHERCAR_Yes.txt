            I was in need of a couple of fairly cheap digital cameras, one for work and one for myself. Both were largely for web work, with the occasional 6x4 print so a camera around 1 megapixel was adequate. The Fuji 1300 was one of the first cameras I looked at, and in general I was fairly impressed. Luckily my local camera shop was more than happy for me to trial my potential purchase.

The 1300 is a 1.3 megapixel camera, with a fixed focus lens, flash, lcd, simple controls and a USB port. 

Construction is plastic, and being aware of my prejudice for metal bodied cameras, It seems pretty robust. It does however have what I consider a major flaw - no lens cover or means of attaching one. Yes the lens is very small but that doesn't prevent it from possibly being scratched, even putting it into a case could scratch it - cases rarely remain dirt free for ever.

The camera comes with a reasonably generous 8mb smartmedia card - if I was taking the card in an out of the camera a lot I would prefer the more robust Compact Flash but as the camera is USB you won't need to do this too often.

Operation of the camera is extremely easy to use with well placed buttons, although the flash and self-timer modes do require a bit of navigation of the menus. In automatic the camera is a piece of cake to operate.

The LCD display is better than some but not stunning - adequate is probably the best description. 

Battery life is reputedly very good (I didn't have it long enough to test but going on the 1400 it should be very good).

Image quality is pretty good for this price range - 6x4's are generally very good 7x5's pretty good, particularly when taken in bright conditions. For holiday snapshots outside this camera should be fine. Considering it's a fixed focus lens images are pretty sharp at most distances.

Indoors is a bit of a mixed bag, if it's bright enough to switch off the flash they'll come out well. The flash is reasonably powerful but has horrendous problems with red-eye (a problem the 1400 shares). Yes it can be edited out afterwards but if you take a lot of photos of people it will quickly become a pain.

Macro mode is easy to operate but moving the camera to get the subject in focus takes a bit of practice.

Yes this camera has a 2x zoom but it's digital so don't get excited - crop your pictures after uploading - it's easier and more accurate.


In general I liked this camera, I could probably have lived with the lack of lens cap and the red-eye, but when you can get the Fuji 1400 with a 3x optical zoom and lens cover for only 50$ more I couldn't buy the 1300 instead. 

If you're on a very tight budget this isn't a bad camera but if you can stretch to the Kodak DC 215 or Fuji 1400 I don't think you'll regret the extra expenditure.
