            My Accord, as well as the previous 4 accords that I have owned have all exceded my expectations.  Heres the deal - your 1994 Honda Accord WIIL LAST OVER 200,000 MILES.  Thats right.  Heres what I have done on ALL 4 of my accords that have all given me MORE THAN 200,000 miles.
1) Change the oil & filter every 3000 miles. (basic)
2) Change your timing chain every 70,000 miles
3) Change your distibutor cap and wires every 80,000 miles
4) Your front steering rods (both right and left) will breaka at about 75,000 to 90,000 miles.  EXPECT IT.  It has happened on ALL of my accords.  Not too pricey to fix, but it is guaranteed to break.
5) Change your thermostat at about 120,000. (Ive never has to change it twice, and on 2 accords, I never had to change it at all)
6)  Exhaust system will last about 70,000 miles before it needs replacment.
6) DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE!!!!

I drive my Honda Accords' HARD.  With a 140 mile commute PER DAY, I exceed 100 miles per hour EVERY NIGHT on my drive home!!!!

Thats all folks.  I LOVE my accords and each time I get another one, I make it a CHALLENGE to  get MORE miles out of it than the one before!

Good Luck!
