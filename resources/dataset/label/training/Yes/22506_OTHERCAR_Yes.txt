            Having purchased a Grand Vitara last year I was both impressed with Suzuki as a dealer/servicer and the truck itself in regards to its handling and make. Even though the Grand Vitara is and was bigger than most other models in its class, I was still a little disappointed with the interior size. Therefore, when Suzuki introduced the XL7, a beefed up version of the Grand Vitara with plenty of room and tinted windows, my wife and I seized the chance to be owners of this precious vehicleï¿½.

Like the Grand Vitara, the exterior of the XL7 remains unique and practical. There are no cosmetic add ons which are unnecessary, but can be purchased as accessories such as a wind blade on the back or protective cover on the front. One item that is not included with the basic model is a hitch, but that can be installed for around $200. Tinted windows are included with all XL7`s adding a modern look and convenient cover against sun rays. The radio and stereo buttons have been enlarged for those of you with big clumsy fingers, but the driving panel remains very similar to the GV. Seating has been improved in my opinion with better cushions, but the most admired feature of the XL7 has to be the general size of the interior. At much less of a price, the XL7 offers enough room to compare itself with Pathfinders and 4Runners which are significantly more expensive and harder on gas. Gas mileage is fairly decent compared to other SUV`s, but nothing compared to the Forester which looks more like a station wagon. As a result, the XL7 has many little extras that other SUV`s do not offer.

One of the downfalls of this model is that, yes, it is roomy and spacious, but unlike the GV the trunk area is partly on a slant since there is an optional 2 seat extension which can  be lifted to increase your load to 7 passengers. This optional seat extension does not fully fold to provide a horizontal storage area but this flaw is manageable. Suzuki will also have to address the gap in the storage area which is located between the seat extension and the rear seats. A 3 to 4 inch gap is located here which can be somewhat annoying if your soup can from your groceries fall in, but otherwise it is fairly manageable.

The XL7 offers a shift while you are driving 4x4 option which I love to use in winter. Some may argue that this option is useless since you cannot shift fast enough if you are gliding dangerously in 2 wheel drive. However, if you use common sense, you would naturally drive in 4x4 in icy conditions when you first started the car rather than later on when you might benefit from it. Use the 4 wheel drive in residential areas which may not be well plowed and snowy, and the 2 wheel drive on 4 lane highways which tend to get better snow plow coverage. In the summer, leave the transmission in 2 wheel drive and use the 4 sparingly on dirt roads or in heavy rainfalls. This shifting option is  a bonus since the all-wheel drives do not give you the option to shift and increase the wear and tear on tires on summer months when all you need is 2 wheel drive.

As a result, the XL7 offers tremendous features and drives beautifully. Honda and Toyota offer similar models but do not offer the same reasonable price nor include features that Suzuki gives at a lower cost. I will admit that driving an SUV is a costly venture compared to compact cars, but if you prefer to sit higher, be less vulnerable to side impact collisions, and you want more traction for winter driving, the XL7 gives the best solution to these problems.
