            recently we purchased a 96' automatic used Neon and have had unbelievable luck with it.. The car is not only compact but it 
drives smoothly and has a lot of driving power to it.. The body is also excellent. A few weeks back I had an accident that 
caused some serious damage to the other guy's vehicle yet mine barely had a scratch.. and then a few days later my spouse hit 
the car with a deer. The damage was unbelievably very little. I like the fact that the car's airbags do not go off if you are driving 
under 20 and hit something. The car also has roomy leg room in front along with plenty of front storage for things such as 
change, Cd's ect.. The downsides however are the car has little leg room in back and the trunk is pretty small.. But it makes up 
more than enough for the child safety locks that can be disengaged if needed and the power windows, doors, side mirrors an 
rear defrost. It also warms very quickly it the heating for those cold temperatures and cool with the A/C just as quickly for those 
hot summer days. From our house to the end of our block our car is nice and toasty if that tells you anything.. It's a great car 
and I wouldn't trade it in anytime soon..<br><br>
