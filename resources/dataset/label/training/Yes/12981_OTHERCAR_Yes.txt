                 I've had enough of this!  This darn 1990 Chevrolet Cavalier!  Barely runs!  I decided it was time for a new car.  Being young, I wanted something stylish but also was dependable.  I searched Hi and Low.  Dodge, Chevrolet, Ford, Hyundai, Honda...Nope...nothing there that was satisfying for me!  Finally my mom says...KIA!       Kia...I thought...uugggghhh...NO WAY!  I had heard too many bad things about the KIA's.  But taking my mom's advice...I went and looked.  I was introduced to the Kia dealership by a nice man who did not seem pushy or in a rush.  (Which really impressed me!)  He told me about all the cars in my price range and showed me all the great features of the cars.  I looked at the Sephia's...I looked at the Optima's...I even looked at the Spectra (but I'm not into the hatchback look.)  And finally I so happened to bump into the little Rio...just hanging out in the corner!  Now I know people say it takes some getting to know something or someone to fall in love...but I'm telling you...It was love at first site!  This cute small car with it's stylish look was practically screaming my name!  I looked at the dealer and I said..."I have to test drive this car!"  So I did...and I fell in love with the way it drove.  It was such a smooth ride and I felt complety safe!  There was plenty of room in the front of the cabin...and I loved the way it was all set up.  The seats were incredibly easy to move...and not only that...but you can adjust the height and everything else of the driver's seat!  Talk about a good first impression!  I looked over at my boyfriend who was test driving it with me and I asked him..."Is there enough room up here for you?"  And with him being a big guy...he said..."Heck yeah!  I love it!"  On returning to the dealership...I hopped out of this beautiful little car and said..."SOLD!"  Of course I had to order mine though...because I wanted a certain color and things in it.  And with the starting price of 8,895...how could I say no???   So I ended up getting the Sunburst Gold colored Rio (Which I must say...I get looks from people because it is such a wild color...but I LOVE it!)  These are all the other thing which I added to my car...

* The Automatic Transmission ($975)
* Air conditioning ($750)
* AM/FM/CD Player Stereo ($395)
* Antilock Brakes ($400)
* 14" Alloy Wheels ($315)
* Rear Spoiler ($85)
* Carpeted Floor Mats ($69)
* The Upgrade Package Which includes Power Steering, Full Wheel Covers, Body Side Moldings, Tilt Steering Wheel, and  Visor Vanity Mirrors...all for ($380)

     What I paid for my car was well worth it!  I love it and have had NO problems with it.  It is quiet on the highway, it zips around corners, and you can park it in places that other cars could only dream of!  
   
                    (A few Cons)  

The back seat may be a little squishy for extremly tall people...and there isn't a HUGE sound system in it.  This car also does not come with power locks or windows...but that was NO problem for me since I did not want those options anyways.  I find that when it is winter...the power locks and windows freeze all TOO often.   Also I heard from several Rio owners that as soon as you hit 3000 miles...the engine light comes on.  (But with those great warranties...you have nothing to worry about!)  

The only thing you should have to do is get your Rio's oil changed and it is good to go.  

     Would I recommend this car to people?  OF COURSE!  Don't let people tell you the KIA's are no good...I mean heck...take a look at their 10 Year 100,000 Mile, (That fixes all the big stuff like the engine) 5 Year 60,000 Mile warranty (Which covers from bumper to bumper) and their 5 year unlimited mileage road side assistance! (Which will cover you if you lock your keys in the car, run out of gas ect.)  Another good thing about the road side assistance is if you are more that 150 miles away from home and your car takes more that twenty four hours to fix, KIA will pay for your food and lodging! This company MUST have a lot of Confindace in their cars to give these THREE warranties with each car!  At first I looked down on KIA but now I'm only looking up!  


I hope that you find this helpful in someway...and hopefully it can somewhat persuade you to look at the Kia Rio!  They are such great little cars...and mine...well even my boyfriend will tell you...It's the LOVE of my life!
