            Daewoo, is not so popular yet, but it soon will be.  I recently bought a Daewoo in Florida, USA.  It is a nice little car, Sedan.  Judging from the outside I said wow! It sure must be small on the inside, but surprisingly it wasn't.  I am around 6 feet tall and I had plenty of leg room and about 6 inches left of head room when sitting :).  I recommend this car because it is good on gas. That was one of the biggest things I was looking for when buying a car.  This is my first car also, and it is an automatic.  I believe you can get them in sticks also.  It has bucket seats and the rear seats &quot;both&quot; fold down to make even more trunk space.  One thing I was also amazed at was the outstanding turning radius. The book says 16 ft (4.9m) but I think it does even better then that.  Now I bet everyone here is going to be amazed by this but when we went to the dealer, (we went everywhere in Florida, from Toyota to oldsmobile), I did not think for a second I would own the car I sat in.  I took it for a test drive and everything normal. As I was getting out of the car, the man asked me if I liked it? I replied,&quot;Yes, It would be perfect if it had a CD player&quot;.  He said that he would take out the cd player in a more expensive car and put it in that one (with the cassette still their) and switch them for free if I bought the car at its already low price!  I was so amazed, because CD players in a car are a good 200 if you are looking for a really good one.  So I got the car. BUT!!!  Their is only ONE thing I did not like about my new car.  It was the alarm system.  It took some time to get used to.  See, My car came with a remote keyless entry thing for the key-chain, so if you lock the car with it, then you HAVE to unlock it with the keyless entry remote.  It took me about a week to get used to it.  The keyless entry has a Lock, Unlock, and even an alarm button (got to hold in the alarm button for it to go).  Yes I would recommend this to everyone that is looking into buying a car, and their is one more thing, since my car was new, it took some time to get broken in, and the gas mileage was not as good as they said it would be, but after around 500 miles it went right back up their.<br><br>
