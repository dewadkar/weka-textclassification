            Since the other top contenders were the Lexus GS400 and Jag S-Type, I first steered my father towards the 540i. He only had to sit in this car to reject it. It feels a bit tight, front and rear, and many of the interior materials simply look and feel non-luxurious, if not cheap. This is especially true of the center console and door panels. It didn�t help that the car�s interior was finished in various yellowish shades. It looked like the colors some interiors fade to. Color aside, from the inside this doesn�t feel like anything approaching a $55k car. I�ve made similar complaints about the Lincoln LS. Clearly Lincoln would have benchmarked the 540 when developing their competitor. But they didn�t have to copy the bad with the good!

(Note: While the Lexus is similarly tight in back, in front it is considerably roomier.)

So we moved up to a 740i. This car feels a bit more luxurious inside, and is definitely roomier. The dealer didn�t have a new one available to drive, so we drove a 1998 car with 23k miles on it. Since nothing significant has changed about this car in the last two years, we felt this was indicative of how a new 740i would perform.

There's not much to say about the styling. It's a BMW. OK, I can say a bit. I liked the previous 7 better. The style of that car had more edge to it, it had stronger surfaces. The current design looks watered down in comparison, more generic. (The new 3 continues this trend.) The huge flat black rocker panels don't do much for me, either. All this said, the overall design is well-proportioned and pleasant, if not striking. The interior is classic BMW as well. It looks hard and purposeful. Unfortunately, it feels much the same way. More on that later.

The engine is powerful and has a typically Germanic mechanical sound to it. Unfortunately, it is let down a bit by the transmission, which seems to have tall gearing and takes a bit of prodding to force a downshift. Definitely a capable powertrain, but not as entertaining as I had expected.

Note: For 2000 this engine appears to have been retuned to produce more mid-range torque. Though none of the &quot;what's new for 2000&quot; blurbs mention it, I notice that torque this year is up 14 lbs-ft, and horsepower peaks 300 rpm earlier. This would improve response a bit. On the other hand, BMW engines often take a few thousand miles to loosen up. This one was past that point, so should have been performing at the top of its potential. Either way, the car I drove had plenty of power. The lack of response I experienced was largely if not entirely due to the transmission.

Ride and handling are both very good. In motion, this car feels lighter and smaller than it is. The chassis has a very balanced feel to it. Still, while it didn�t complain when hustled through corners, it didn�t beg to be driven quickly either. The point with this class of car is relaxed motoring; the performance capabilities are simply on-call in case they are needed. Fun is not the top priority. A 540i would probably have been superior in this regard, given its smaller size and different mission.

Given the luxury mission of this car, it is probably fairer to compare it to the Lexus LS rather than the GS. The problem is that it�s somewhere in between these two cars. It lacks the enthusiasm for hard driving possessed by the GS. Yet it also lacks the fluid feel and overall luxuriousness of the LS. Instead, it has the direct, connected feel common to German luxury cars, but without the aggressive responses that usually goes with this feel. 

The real problem, however, is that despite all of the leather and wood the interior does not feel sufficiently luxurious for this price class. The problem is mostly that BMW always makes the top of the dash and door panels a flat dark color. I believe this is done to reduce glare. These being the areas your eye is most likely to see while driving, BMW takes care to make them as matte as possible. However, the flip side of these being the areas you see the most is that they contribute heavily to the perceived ambiance of the interior. They overwhelm the more luxurious materials that lurk below them. As a result, the interior feels spartan in a way unbecoming a car in this class.

As I reflect on this review I recall other BMW�s I�ve driven in the past, an assortment of threes and fives. I tend not to like their driving position, or, more precisely, how the height of the instrument binnacle makes you feel buried in the car. I don�t see what would suffer if the binnacle was simply an inch lower. Forward visibility would certainly improve. Other aspects of the interior design makes some surfaces feel too close to you and others too far away. These cars never cosset you like a Jag. But I also know that under the right conditions they can shine. I once delivered a mid-80�s 535i from Virginia to Chicago for one of my father�s friends. Not very enjoyable on highways, the chassis woke up off of them. On the curvy, hilly two lane roads of West Virginia and Ohio, the 535 was delightful. The chassis was perfectly balanced. The steering precisely answered every input. So I can see that in their element BMWs are wonderful cars. 

Problem is, my father rarely if ever drives in this element. Instead, he takes straight, level roads, often highways, about town. Here, rich materials and a fluid feel become more important. Lacking these, this car did not make the final cut.<br><br>
