            The Lexus SC Coupe was first introduced in June of 1991, Lexus' third offering in the States.  The sporty, yet luxurious coupe started with a V8 engine and an automatic transmission.  A year later, a 6-cylinder engine with a 5-speed manual (optional automatic) became available.  The SC300/400 was dropped in 2000 due to low sales and was revived in 2002 as the all-new Lexus SC430 convertible.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: I think the SC's design is one of its best features.  The coupe's styling is so elegant, yet sporty, I feel that very few cars can compare.  The original design was actually penned in California at Toyota's Calty Design Studio.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: Wind and road noise in the SC is not as muted as I would expect from Lexus, but when compared to other coupes, it is VERY quiet.  The power-operated leather seats are quite comfortable and offer a wide range of seating positions.  As far as room is concerned, expect to have to push the front seats pretty far back if you are long-legged.  Doing so, however, would virtually ELIMINATE rear-seat room.  For a coupe that is so long (191.1 inches), I would expect even a little more accommodation in the rear.  When there IS room in the rear, however, the seats are quite comfortable, but headroom is compromised especially with the available sunroof.  The gauges glow white at night and have red needles.  At first, the I found the instrument panel distracting at night, but over time became used to it.

For a car of this size, I would also expect more truck space as well.  With only 9.3 cubic feet of cargo space, even smaller coupes offer more space.  Getting in and out the SC, for me, is relatively easy.  Lexus designed special hinges for the doors that allow it to push forward somewhat for easier access to the cabin.  The doors are still long and heavy, though.

The cabin just SCREAMS Lexus quality, craftsmanship, and opulence.  The wood accents are REAL, not simulated.  The leather even after a year or so, still has a nice scent.  The interior materials have a nice, solid feel too- just what I would expect from a Lexus.  Standard features include power windows, door locks, mirrors, cruise control, alloy wheels, and a Cassette/CD player.  Some options include a power sunroof, and leather upholstery.  The latter is standard on the SC400.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The SC300 is powered by a 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine.  Early models put out 225 horsepower and 210 lb./ft. of torque.  In 1998, with the addition of Variable Valve Timing (VVT), torque increased to 220 lb./ft.  This is the same engine that powers such cars as the base Toyota Supra and currently, the Lexus IS (the latter with minor modifications).  Standard is a 5-speed manual transmission.  An optional 4-speed automatic is also available.  1998 was the last year any 5-speed SC's were manufactured.

My test model, the SC400, is powered by a 4.0-liter V8 engine.  With 300 horsepower and 310 lb./ft. of torque on tap, low-speed acceleration is almost explosive.  The smooth, responsive 5-speed automatic transmission replaced the old 4-speed unit in 1998.  Although the most of torque seems to be concentrated between 2,500-4,500 rpm, the SC just LOVES to rev.  Around town, there is more than enough low-end torque to push you back into seats during hard acceleration.  Highway passing and merging is as easy as 1-2-3.  1-look, 2-change lanes, 3-FULL THROTTLE!  Despite the rather hefty 3,655-pound curb weight, the SC400's 225/55VR-16 tires can still be easily made to spin wildly with excessive throttle inputs from a standing start.

As with all V8 engines, fuel economy will be much less overall than with the 6-cylinder engine.  EPA estimates of 18 city, 25 highway suggest 16-17 miles per gallon overall with some city and highway driving.  Also, cars with 8-cylinder engines, tend to have much higher insurance rates than those with 4,5 or 6.  There are no V8/5-speed (manual) combinations available for the SC due to emissions and insurance reasons.

<b>HANDLING</b>: Again, with almost 3,700 pounds to lug around, I feel the SC, although quite fun-to-drive, is NOT as nimble as its aggresive styling would suggest.  The coupe was never meant to be a sports car in terms of handling, but with little body lean and nosedive, the SC does exhibit good road manners.  The steering wheel is nicely weighted, and provides good feedback from the road.  The 225/55VR-16 tires do a fairly good job of sticking to the road, but with wider tires (perhaps the 245/40ZR-18 tires used on the current SC430), I KNOW the SC would handle better.

<b>RIDE</b>: The SC's ride is noticeably firm, but never harsh or jarring.  Its 105.9-inch wheelbase should get some credit for smothering most of the bumps on the road.  Personally though, I feel Lexus has done a great job of dialing in a bit of long-haul comfort in what is otherwise, a stiff, sport suspension.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: No 2000 SC300/SC400 recieved a recall.  However, if you are interested in buying a 1996-97, or already one, check out this website for more information regarding a recall.

<b>VALUE</b>: The SC is stylish GT coupe with a lot of luxury features and an available V8 engine.  For about $26,875, you can buy a low-mileage, showroom condition 1998 SC300.  Expect to pay about $31,195 for a low-mileage, fully-loaded SC400.  Although the prices may seem a little steep for a car with a small trunk and useless rear seats, I feel the SC coupe is DEFINITELY worth a look if you are in the market for a high-performance luxury coupe.
