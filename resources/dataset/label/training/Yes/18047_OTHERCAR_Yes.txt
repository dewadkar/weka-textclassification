            The new Mazda Miata is a must drive car. The Miata is small fast car that feels incredible around the turns and on the highway. This car is fun to drive with the top down and cruising along. All the Miata's come in a convertible with the new front headlights that do not flip up. I did not like the previous lights that were flip up, they took away from the sleek design.

The Miata is especially for those who want to have fun when they are driving and not have to pay big bucks. For around 20K this car is your best bet for a cheap and fast car. When your are in the manual tranny model and nail the gas you can hear the car whizz up to 6000rpm. The car quickly jumps out of first and then into second gear in a matter of seconds. The throws on the gears are short and the shift nob is close so you do not have to move very far to change gears. All the control buttons are nearby as well for easy access.

I although I personally love the Miata there are some drawbacks to the wonderful car. I would not recommend it to tall people or for people who need a lot of room. Although I found it roomy enough (I am about 5'10&quot;), I would not recommend it for passenger driving. The car is only a two-seater and would be cramped even if there was someone in the other seat. Although the car gets good gas mileage I would not recommend it for those with a family, unless they expect to use the car only for themselves. <br><br>
