            Although I have reviewed several vehicles for Epinions, each time I begin a new one I am always faced with the dilemma of balancing the facts with opinions (or values/desires).  Hopefully, my observations will help you sort these out for yourself if you are thinking of purchasing a VUE.  All my observations are based on the one I purchased: a FWD 4 cylinder with variable transmission (VTi) and the power package.  I also test drove the all wheel version of the VUE.

Let's start with some facts:  

1. This is car based and not truck based

2. There are no warning stickers on the sunshades         cautioning you about rollovers

3. Electronic steering has a different feel than vacuum assisted power steering

4. There are no shift points in the variable automatic transmission.

5. You can carry a lot of stuff with this and there are a number of ways you can manipulate the interior space.

Here are the opinions:

1. Since this is car based, the ride is more like a very tall station wagon rather than say, the Ford Explorer which very much handles like a truck.  That is neither good nor bad until you consider point #2.

2. The absence of rollover warnings doesn't mean you can drive this like a car.  While the wheelbase is wider than a typical SUV, the center of gravity still is higher than in a station wagon.  The standard warning applies: try not to make sudden navigational moves.

3. Electronic steering allows you to park the VUE with exceptional ease.  I was able to turn the wheel with 1 finger.  On the highway, as you move to cruising speed, the assist lessens and you get a fairly good feel of the road.

4. It is a strange sensation waiting for a shift point in the VTi transmission that will never happen.  This system provides very smooth (though buzzy) acceleration and is claimed to contribute to the stated fuel efficiency (22/28).  The only way I can describe the sensation is that it feels like you never get out of first gear. For only 4 cylinders, I feel I have the power necessary for safe merges and passing.  I did NOT feel that way when I test drove the PT Cruiser. 

5. Hauling options are what SUVs are all about and the VUE will not disappoint in that area.  You can fold the passenger seat completely flat as well as the split 70/30 rear seats and move an 8 foot long whatever with the liftgate closed.  There is also a little plastic crate you can assemble that provides storage compartments so things don't fly around. It disassembles just as easily and lies flat when you don't need it.  There are wells to hold jugs of milk or bleach, and tie hooks to attach grocery bags to. 

So what does this all add up to?  Well, if you have any familiarity with Saturns and you like the typical austere styling, dent resistant polymer side panels and no haggle purchasing experience I would recommend you give the VUE a test drive.  It is very much a member of the family, only bigger.  All the standards are there: 24 hour roadside assistance, the 30 day (or 1,500 mile) love it or return it for a full refund and the car wash when you bring it in for service.

The base vehicle comes equipped with a long list of standard features, and there are enough options to let you drive the cost of even the base model up to $23 or $24 thousand if you are so inclined.

Anything I don't like about it?  Well, I'm a little concerned about the thickness of the support columns for the windshield.  They have the potential for being a blind spot.  The Firestone tires are a bit noisy and the electronic steering, at least to me, feels a little "tentative".  

Small note: the drop down list only goes to 2002 at the time I am writing this.  This review is based on the 2003 model.
