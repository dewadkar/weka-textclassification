            So, I must admit I haven't driven this van much (I'm only a poor college student, I'd feel lucky if I had a pinto with three out of the four tires and no spark plugs) because it belongs to my parents, but from my experience, it drives really well.  It is nice and smooth and, as cliche as this is, feels like a car.  Anyway, to go with its nice handling and all that stuff most people are worried about, this minivan also comes with lots of neat gadgets.  For instance, there is this fancy little button that opens and closes one of the two sliding doors for you.  Now, you have to understand that I am about as lazy as they come, and thus this completely fascinated me.  I imagine I opened and closed that door a good 14 times before we even pulled out of the car lot.  Then there are the cup holders.  These seem to appear out of nowhere.  I swear there must be at least a billion of them in the van (well maybe not a billion, but certainly a lot).  Then, there's this system that lets the people in the back listen to a cd or tape while everyone else listens to the radio or vice-versa, and I must say this is great when my mom busts out the books on tape.  Finally, there is this neat little TV you can get that pops down out of the ceiling.  I mean how neat is it that even when we are in the van, I can still catch Sense and Sensibility or whatever the latest chick flick out is.
Well, as I'm sure you've gathered, I certainly recommend this minivan if you are in the market for such a vehicle.<br><br>
