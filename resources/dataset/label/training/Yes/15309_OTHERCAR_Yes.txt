            <b>Sony does it's magic</b>

I actually own this particular camera. I was on a set path to change myself over into the digital world and I was looking at cameras. Sony's Digital Mavica line immediately caught my eye for the price, the style, and the options that came with the camera. The camera itself has countless features on it.
 
<b>So many features, so little time</b>  

Using Sony's interpolated imaging technology you can realize a 17% increase in image size, which delivers a 1 million pixel image for viewing or printing. Capture up to 60 seconds of full motion video and audio right onto a standard 3.5&quot; floppy disk. This is the easiest, fastest way to get full motion video into your personal computer for a variety of applications. This new exclusive technology is improved once again by doubling the speed to 4x when recording or playing back images. The high speed 4X floppy disk drive spindle motor combined with new Digital Signal Processing also allows for quicker JPEG and MPEG compression. Voice Memo Mode allows you to conveniently add narration to a still image. Use it in presentations, or slide shows to describe and demonstrate products, or personal images. Nine different exposure modes help you make your pictures shine even in the most difficult lighting conditions.... 

Portrait -- isolates subject from background 
Beach &amp; Snow--compensates for underexposure of darker objects against light backgrounds 
Sports -- fast shutter speed to reduce blur 
Landscape -- for wide-angle applications 
Sunset &amp; Moon -- compensates for overexposure of light objects against dark backgrounds 
Pan Focus 
Spot Meter 
Slow Shutter 1 
Slow Shutter 2 

Sony's new Auto Focus technology delivers the highest level of focusing accuracy. This high speed system ensures that your pictures are sharp and clear. For extra close-ups, Auto Macro gets you within 1&quot; of your subject. The powerful zoom lens with focus ring gives you the flexibility and precision you need to capture professionally-polished images. If you like to get close to your subjects, use Auto Macro for shots up to 1 inch from your subject. Now you can copy your pictures right inside the camera. Images saved in the Digital Mavica camera's temporary memory can then be copied to a new disk. In addition to image files, you can also save and copy Excel, PowerPoint and Word files. Need to send images or video over the Internet? For still images, E-mail mode reduces the size of your file to the standard file 320 x 240 for fast Internet downloads. To send MPEG movies over the Internet, the E-mail mode will reduce the image size to 160 x 112. Now your pictures or videos will be sent with ease and speed. 

<b>but wait......theres more</b>

(WYSIWYG) What you see is what you get! A large, full color LCD display viewfinder lets you preview or review your shots right on the camera back, with great detail and clarity. Take a close look at the image you're capturing by instantly freezing it on your LCD. Simply press and hold the shutter button down. For convenient playback, return to the play mode and use quick replay to display the lost image captured. 
A wide range of shutter speeds allows you to capture fast-moving objects and freeze them in motion. Auto Exposure automatically corrects the amount of light on the subject. White Balance adjusts to match the true color of the subject, These features ensure your picture quality is always superior, no matter how inferior the conditions. The Digital Mavica camera is good for up to 1000 consecutive shots with this rechargeable lithium-ion battery. That's 50 floppies in fine mode or shot after shot every few seconds. And you won't get caught without power because the Accupower meter displays the remaining battery life in minutes. The sleek and slimmer design is not only eye-catching, it's even easier to use and carry. The universal storage media of choice, floppy disks are extremely easy to use and inexpensive. Now you can stop worrying about expensive and exotic storage media. For easy image storage and hassle-free portability, the floppy is the format of choice. The Digital Mavica camera uses the universal JPEG compression format to store images on your floppy, providing you with excellent picture quality and allowing you to view your images on virtually any computer.

I would recommend this product to anyone who still uses the old 35mm and pays out the ass in developing fees. When I bought the camera, I also bought a cube of 100 floppy disks. So, now I take pictures, print them, and format the disk to use all over again. Cost effective, damn right.

I would not recommend this product to anyone who enjoys paying the high prices for developing to get a shot that they are not sure they got or not.
