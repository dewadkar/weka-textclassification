            My first Pathfinder was a '96. I bought it because of it's solid build and sporty feel. Later on did I find out that the engine in the '96 model was &quot;the worst built Pathfinder engine ever made by Nissan.&quot; I said, oh great, I'm stuck with this car for another 34 months until my lease runs out. 

They were right, the engine did have many problems with it. I had to take it to be serviced 6 times during my 3 year lease. There were a lot of electrical problems that had to be corrected also, (like the LOW OIL light on the dashboard that would stay lit even if the oil was fine). Little things like that got really annoying throughout the time I had that car.

When the lease ran out, I still test drove every other SUV out there to see if I liked any of them better.  I got another Pathfinder. The 2000 model is physically different from the previous model. It looks more &quot;utility&quot; like.  

I have the LE model, fully loaded. It's wonderful. The interior is very classy, very luxury like. I got the model with the 6 cylinder engine, the V8 would eat up gas like nothing. So, because of this, the pick-up of the car, (0-60) time is not very impressive. It seems like when I put the pedal to the floor at a green light there's no oompf to the acceleration.  But who needs acceleration? If you do, you should buy a sports car.

The one thing I don't like about the Pathfinder, is the back seats. The 2 back doors are tiny. My overweight father can barely fit in the little space to get into the back. My suggestion is, if you have kids, this car is great, kids won't complain about having this difficulty. If you're going to be hauling full grown adults around, it might be a little tedious to get in and out of the back seats. Not enough room.

Everything else about this car is great, it hasn't given me any problems. The newer model even has a tape player (my '96 Pathfinder ONLY had a CD player.)

I like this car a lot, it's very well built, very durable, and very classy.<br><br>
