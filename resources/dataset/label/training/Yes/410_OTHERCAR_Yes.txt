            I bought a 1987 Quantum Syncro about 18 months ago for $1650. This is one of the best cars i've ever owned for snow driving if you put good snow tires on it. The AWD system (exactly the same as an Audi 4000) is reliable except for the vacuum lines to the differential locks, which are cheap.

Rust can be a problem on these, but I'm in Denver, so mine isn't too bad. The fuel injection (Bosch CIS-E) and Hall ignition system are also quite reliable and need little (if any) adjustment. The inline-5 engine runs pretty smoothly for being a 5-cylinder. If it doesn't, something is wrong. If you're looking at one and it has what sounds like a single valve tappet clicking, it's the rod for the vacuum pump making noise (yes, it runs off the camshaft). You can replace the rod, but most people ignore it. Rattles are far less than normal for a 15-year-old car: far better than a Honda, but not dead silent even with 200k miles like a Mercedes. EPA claims 16/20 for gas mileage. I get about 20/22.

The seats come in "standard" which are pretty normal and boring or "sport" which have high bolsters on the sides of the seat and back. I'm 6'3" and 240lb and the sport seats  in mine are fine. If you are tall, the back seat behind you has very little leg room. 

These cars are probably best for someone who can read a service manual. Only 3000 ever made it to the USA, so most mechanics don't know what they're doing. If you have a good Audi Quattro mechanic in town (in Colorado there are lots), he/she won't have any problem with it. Parts are not as bad as it sounds--there are a lot of 2wd Quantums and a lot of Audi 4000 Quattros. Between those two, you can find the entire drivetrain (Audi) and body (2wd VW). Parts that are syncro-specific (exhaust system, a few interior parts, etc) can be pricey.

All in all, this is a great car for getting from point A to point B every single time, no matter how bad the weather. It's not stylish or flashy, but the last laugh is yours when the Syncro will get down a snowy road that SUVs won't.

UPDATE: I've owned my Syncro for just over 2 years now. My list of problems has been very short. A partially-dead fuel pump relay ($18, 10 mins) made starting difficult in warm weather, and my A/C compressor ($100) died this spring, possibly due to neglect by a previous owner. Other than that, I've just changed the oil, put gas in it, and replaced the spark plugs, cap, and rotor after about 20k miles.

I also made it through the major snowstorm (3') in March without incident. I could get out on the road to check out all the people who were stuck and bust a tow hook pulling an SUV out of a snowdrift.
