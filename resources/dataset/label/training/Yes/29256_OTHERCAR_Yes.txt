             My husband and I weren't even in the market to buy an SUV.  We were truck shopping.  After all, isn't that what every American male wants? 

 But we also own our janitorial business so we needed a truck to haul all our stuff.  As we looked all over at all makes of trucks we ended up more and more discouraged.  Yes the trucks would work for what we needed but we just couldn't get excited about any truck that we looked at. 

 Then one day we were driving around and I looked over and saw a Jeep.  I just made the comment, &quot;How about an SUV?&quot; It has enough room in the back to haul all our stuff, and we can also use it for vacations to haul our dogs.  So then we began comparing different SUV's.  We finally narrowed it down to the Chevy Blazer.  Let me tell you that we are completely thrilled with our Blazer in almost every way.  The only thing we don't really like is the gas mileage it gets.  We would like it to get more but other than that we are completely satisfied.<br><br>
