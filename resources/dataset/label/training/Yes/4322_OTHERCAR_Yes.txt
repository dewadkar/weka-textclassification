            This is my second camera, and oh boy do I love my little toy. My first digital camera was the DSC-P5. I would have to say when I was buying a digital camera I didn't understand much of the terminology that came along with the camera. It is quite confusing at first but doesn't take too long to understand. This camera is way ahead of the rest and takes far superior pictures from other digital cameras such as kodak, nikon, etc. I will mainly explain all the features to let you know what they mean and what they do. As when any person buys a digital camera, you should know what and how to compare it from other cameras (ex. optical zoom vs. digital zoom).

Features:
<b>3.2 Mega Pixles</b>
This camera comes with 3.2 Mega Pixels. This is just right for any person taking pictures. If you want pictures for just the web anything from 1-2 Megapixels would do just fine. This is above that so it is adequate to be used for web pictures or normal use.

<b>3x Optical Zoom, 2X Precision digital Zoom</b>
This is a little tricky part that lots of people get confused about. What is optical and what is digital zoom. Well Optical zoom is what you want most of, that is the actual zooming without enlarging it. Digital zoom is the process in which it is enlarged digitally. It is kind of when you have a picture on a camera and use the zoom in feature. As you zoom in the picture looses its sharpness. 

<b>3 Area Multi-point Auto Focus, Auto Focus Illuminator light, 5-step Manual Focus with Macro</b>
These are good features that come in handy quite often. The 3 Area Multi-point Auto Focus is used for when you have a bigger number of people spread accross an area. Or even if there are two people and there is a big gap in between the two people. This will take 3 points in the area and average the zoom.
The Auto Focus Illuminator light is the auto focus for the people who don't want to mess with any of the technical stuff. It shines a little red light that lands on the subject you are photographing. The camera uses this light to adjust to the subject and takes the photograph. 
The 5 step Manual Focus with Macro is basically if you know how far your subject is and don't want the camera to adjust. For instance, lets say you are taking a picture of something that is behind a fence. You don't want the camera focusing on the fence, but what is behind the fence. You select how far you want to focus and shoot.

<b>Twilight, Twilight Portrait (Slow shutter with Flash) and Landscape Scene Modes</b>
These are all forms of taking pictures when there is not a lot of light. These modes require a steady hand, for if you don't it'll look blurry. I recommend buying the tripod stand. What this does is slows down the shutter so that it can get more light from the surroundings. 

<b>Eye-level true-zoom Optical Viewfinder</b>
This is a good feature to let you know when you are zooming in optically and digitally. It has a little bar meter and once you cross the line you are turning into a digitalized picture.

<b>Red Eye Reduction</b>
It does have a more sophisticated name in the manual but it is basically just a red eye reduction tool. It just gives quick bursts of light before your picture.

<b>QXGA (2048x1536), QXGA 3:2 (2048x1360), UXGA (1600x1200), SXGA (1280x960), VGA (640x480) sizes</b>
The 2048x1536 size is just big overall. I don't know why you would want a picture that big, but hey its there. The next size down 2048x1360 is about the same size except with a wide screen picture look. All of them just get smaller as you go depending on your preference. If you want a regular picture for your computer you'll be fine with just using the 640x480 picture mode.

<b>3 MPEG Movie modes with audio - Video mail (160x112), Presentation (320x240) and HQX (320x240) with 16fps full screen playback. EX (EXtended) clip length limited only by capacity of media (90 min w/128MB MS)</b>
These are all good feautres. If you wanna make a little home movie when the kid is having a birthday. I don't see why people would use this little thing for a video camera. Seems useless. You might as well just use a camcorder. If you do use it with audio, make sure to have a couple of memory sticks because they do waste fast.

<b>Multi-burst mode captures 16 320x240 frames at selectable 1/7.5, 1/15, 1/30 sec Intervals for motion analysis</b>
This is a better thing i guess, if you have a webcam it'll sort of be what it looks like when you chat over the web. Webcams use burst modes which take second intervals to capture. Don't use as much memory compared to the video recording.

<b>USB driver for Microsoft� Windows� 98/98SE/Me/2000 Pro, XP Home/Pro, Macintosh� OS 8.5.1/8.6/9.0/9.1/9.2</b>
This is probably the best compared to other digital cameras. Most other digital cameras have a docking station of some sort. This is just plug and go.

<b>S-Video output</b>
This is great when you go to someone's house and you want to do a slideshow on their t.v. You can show the video that you recorded or the honeymoon pictures, whatever you wish.

<b>Supplied Accessories: NP-FC10 InfoLithium� battery, AC-LS1 AC adaptor/in-camera charger, A/V and USB cables, wrist strap, MSA-16A 16MB Memory Stick� media; CD-ROM w/Pixela ImageMixer for Sony v1.0, USB driver</b> 
While some other recent Sony cameras have switched to AA batteries, the P7 uses the tried-and-true InfoLithium battery. The included NP-FC10 battery is about the size of three Memory Sticks put together. You'll be able to get about 80 minutes of photo-taking per charge. The included AC adapter plugs right into the camera to recharge the battery in about 150 minutes

Now I could go on on with the features it has, but i just laid out the main ones. These are the most common features and things you should look at when purchasing a digital camera.
