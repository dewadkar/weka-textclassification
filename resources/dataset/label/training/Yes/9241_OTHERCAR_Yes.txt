            I love this car. Ok, so I don't own one, but my fiancees parents just bought a brand new 2000 Impreza Outback Sport. Its sweet. We borrow it from time to time and have even used it for a trip to Albany once(about 4 hours drive for us) We found that it drives comfortably and smoothly and is no problem even on the interstates. It has great handling, comfy seats, good power, decent gas mileage, and of course as in most new cars, a CD player with pretty good sounding factory speakers. It handles as well as any SUV or 4WD in the winter, since it is All Wheel Drive. They(my fiancees parents) have gotten lots of comments on it from friends and relatives and I can't wait till the let us borrow it again as it is deffinately a step up from my '90 Camry.(which i also have a review on). The only real &quot;problem&quot; I've found is that the back is a little cramped for 3 passengers. For the most part it is not bad, but when we went on a trip with my fiancees parents, and we brought Josh(our 1 1/2 year old) the car seat took up a lot of room and we ended up very squished. But besides that, the car is great and is very dependable and drives great in the winter, which is important for us northern New Yorkers near Canada.<br><br>
