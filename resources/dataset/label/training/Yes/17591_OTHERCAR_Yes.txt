            When we were car shopping, we were looking for something relatively inexpensive but reliable.  The Plymouth Neon fit the bill perfectly.  As one of the least expensive new cars available, it is easy on the budget.  We purchased a 1998 4-door sedan with a pretty basic package: automatic, air conditioning, tilt wheel, AM/FM Cassette, power locks and mirrors. 
The car is very easy to handle.  It brakes well and gets good mileage (25 city/35hwy) It has adjustable seat belts in the front which are very comfortable.  The Am/FM Cassette is a nice little stereo for the money, and the sound quality is good.
The back seat is small.  We have two children in car seats and there is not room for much else.  It tends to get noisy in the back seat when we drive on the highway.  I don't know the technical reasons for this, but it sounds like air rushing by and it makes it very difficult to hear front seat passengers.  
This is an excellent car for young families or singles.  It might be awkward for someone who is extremely tall or who has limited mobility, as it IS a small vehicle. I highly recommend this car.<br><br>
