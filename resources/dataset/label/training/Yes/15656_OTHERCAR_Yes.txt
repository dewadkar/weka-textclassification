            After much research, I finally purchased the FD-91, and so far have been very happy.  The best thing that I like about the camera is that it does not use the expensive and hard to find memory sticks, but the 3 1/2&quot; floppy disks that are cheap and readily available.  It has a series of motion sensors that help remove the shake from your pictures.
I have used the MPEG feature to include short movies of my son to my friends.  I like this better than the FD88 due to lens attachments available for the FD-91.

The resolution is not in the Mega pixel range, around 800,000 pixel, but for the computer, it is not to bad. Printing on a good printer, you still get a good image.

The cost is a bit high, in my opinion, but overall it does a great job.
