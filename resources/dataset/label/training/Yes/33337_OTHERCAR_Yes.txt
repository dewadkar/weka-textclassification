                It's the early the age of speed, aerodynamics, and capacity. The Voyager tops many Vans. Capacity played a huge role when I bought my Voyager. My son is in the band. In fact he is on the drum line. That's like 17 people or teenagers. The Van has come into view when he joined. A lot of the times on Friday's after school the drum line always had to go eat. The van made up a big difference. He fit 8 and even sometimes 9 people to go eat in. That's half of the drum line. There was also a time when I worked with the cheerleaders and they sometimes had big crowds. Well my van split the car usage only needing say two other cars. So when it comes to capacity the Voyager is one of the #1 hits.
    The real reason why I bought this car was because we had had a number of old cars and they just weren't getting us around when it came time to got to Atlanta. That's six hours away and on the kids it was a pretty tough time trying to sleep. So I asked God if he would give us a car that we could use when it came time to make the usual run to Granny's. So that is when we found the Voyager. It was a special ordered Van it had everything and then some. 
    This car has a 3.0 litre MISTSUBISHI Engine V8 in it. When you want horses this van can take you anywhere. The propulsion as you may call it was maraculous, on stomp on the pedal and you'd be out of this world in no time flat. The only thing standing in your way of being of exceeding the speed of light are the cops. 
    Really the only person who shouldn't buy this Voyager is somebody who doesn't like space. This has a lot to go around. But for the most part, you want speed, come to the Voyager. You want capacity come to the Voyager. &quot;Ain't no shame from the sane, in buying a Plymouth Voyager, for him, for them, or for her.&quot;
