            Now, I have no claim to fame as far as knowing all about cars, but I will tell you that my '92 Plymouth Sundance has treated me well.  I will also tell you that I live near Fairbanks, Alaska and at the thought of that, you should all be shivering.  Up here in Alaska, it is very important to have a good vehicle for the winter because if you buy a hooptie car, you are going to have a very large problem driving around.  Hence the need to have a decent, economical car that will pull you through snow, ice fog, and -50 degree temperatures.  I would have to say that out of all 50 states, Alaska is the true test of a vehicle and whether it will outlast the competition in making it through the winter.

Anyway, I bought this my car from a friend for approximately $2700, which is not a bad price considering that we live in the land of overpriced everything.  My husband had a vehicle ('92 Chevy S10 which blew up...different story).  I needed something to basically get me from point A to point B with little or no hassle and good gas mileage.  I might live in a place where oil exists in great amounts, but you should see the gas prices here.  So, with this in mind, I purchased my little red, two door car and have been pleased with it ever since.  It is an automatic, front wheel drive car which is perfect for me.  We live on a base where they don't like to plow the roads or salt down the intersections, but with careful driving and good braking, I have never had the problem of sliding through stop signs or fish tailing.

Another great thing about this car is that it warms up fairly fast (usually in about 10 minutes)  Being that I usually have to go out in the freezing cold to start up my car for work or anything else, this is a plus.  There is nothing worse up here than going from a warm house to a vehicle that has been started 20 minutes previous and it is still cold.

The trunk space is actually fairly large in the '92 Plymouth Sundance that I have.  I can also push the backseat down if I need more room for purchases or other things which is really nice and I can seat 5 people comfortably.  Altogether, the car handles wonderfully, has great alignment, is easy to maintain, and is comfortable and safe to drive.

Soon I will be leaving this state and will have to sell my little car.  I can only hope that I find another car as great as this one.  It has gotten me through almost 3 winters of horrid temperatures with no problems except for my muffler (which is now fixed) and many trips back and forth to North Pole and Fairbanks.  The 1992 Plymouth Sundance will probably be the best used car I ever buy.  I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for an inexpensive, low maintenance car that will go the distance for them.  

Thank you for reading and good day to you all. <br><br>
