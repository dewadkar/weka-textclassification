            This review is actually of the 2001 VW Cabrio GLS - My first new car!!!

I wanted a convertible - who doesn't? - but safety is a major priority of mine.  The VW Cabrio is both stylish, fun to drive, and SAFE!  With duel side airbags, front airbags, ABS, and a cute roll-bar, this car has the safety aspect down cold.

The front seats have lots of leg room - so even our tall friends will be comfy in the front.  The back is tight, but not so tight that two adults won't fit.  They will, but it's better if they aren't taller than about 5'8.  The front seats adjust up and down, front and back, and the angle.  So you can really make the car feel like it was custom made for you.  The front seats also have seat warmers, so you'll never have to put the top up, even in the dead of winter.

The Cabrio is a fun, youthful vehicle.  But anyone who is a kid at heart will enjoy driving it.  It is not (by any stretch of the imagination) a fast car, so if speed is your thing, keep shopping.

One thing to note is that if you choose a white top it will be vinyl.  All other tops are cloth.  The cloth tops must be kept dry and up (or they will develop mold or creases), the vinyl top, while more durable, must be cleaned once a week.

I'd say get this car if you are thinking about it.  In the research I did before buying it, I discovered that VWs retain their value very well and that, for a convertible, the Cabrio is a rather safe car.
