            The arena red 1999 Porsche Boxster is the prettiest little car I've ever seen.  (Arena red is the burgundyish color.  It looks terrible on the sample plate, but on the car it's by far my favorite. &lt;Though I do have a soft spot for the black Boxster with Nephrite Green interior. Now that's slick.&gt;).  The Boxster is tiny, making it the easiest thing I've ever parked in my life.  

Driving with the top down is beautiful, even on highway trips.  The Boxster has a mid-mounted engine, which means that there are two trunks.  Unfortunately, both trunks are smallish.  The back trunk can fit a long item, like the golf bag that the Porsche people like to tell us will fit back there, but not something that is long and wide.  My guitar case wound up riding in the lap of the person riding shotgun.  The front trunk is smaller, but deep.  I think the volume of the trunk in the front is greater than that of the back trunk.  (I can fit in the front trunk! That's not practical, but it's a fun bit of random trivia.)

The Boxster is supposed to have a quiet purr.  Mine growls, but that's apparently because of an &quot;extra&quot; to make it noisier, more sports-car-like. &lt;According to my father.&gt;  I kind of like the louder engine, but it gets on my mother's nerves, so I guess you need to decide for yourself whether you want to be able to pretend there are motorcycles chasing you. 

The biggest problem with the Boxster is that it's an absolute pansy of a car when it comes to snow.  With 2&quot; of snow on the ground, my mom tried to take it to pick my sister up from school.  She pulled up to the curb and managed to get hopelessly stuck.  It became necessary for my sister to hail some upperclassmen to come rescue her by pushing the car away from the curb. &lt;Don't think she didn't love that.&gt;

I love the way the Boxster moves.  It handles beautifully, is very responsive, and stops on a dime.  With the Tiptronic transmission, the car can run in automatic or manual, it's the driver's perrogative.  The gear shifts are located on the sides of the steering wheel, so you don't have to take your hands off the wheel to switch gears.  Another thing about this car that's amusing/endearing is that it really wants to go fast.  It switches gears very quickly in automatic mode.  At 20mph you're in third gear.  It's sort of distressing to find yourself in 5th gear driving in the city. 

The Boxster has one design flaw, which is the plastic rear window.  It fogs easily, gets dirty easily, and even when clean is impossible to see through.  There is also one design bonus, what I like to refer to as &quot;Car with a hat!&quot;.   The Boxster has a removable hard top, so you don't have to have the soft top up.  If possible, the Boxster looks even better with the hardtop on than it does with the top down.  It's just a beautiful little car that handles like a dream. It's great fun to drive, and a really comfortable ride.  

If you're living in an area that gets snow, the Boxster is the perfect second car, so you have something to fall back on when it's snowing and you can drive the Boxster when it's nice out.  <br><br>
