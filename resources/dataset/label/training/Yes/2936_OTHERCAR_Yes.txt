            Well, where do I start? I am absolutely in love with my 2000 integra coupe. I think the color that I have, black, is one of the nicer ones. I'm also pretty fond of the silver & red models. I've only had my integra since january of this year, however, I bought it as a demo with about 9,000 miles already on it. I have to say, at 17,000 miles, my car is running like new. It has great pick-up speed, and is pretty powerful for a 4 cylinder, 1.8 liter engine,although I do wish the horsepower was a little higher on the LS model. Honestly, I think this is a pretty good car for just about anyone. Young people like its sporty exterior, while more mature adults can appreciate the great handling and dynamics of the car. At first, I have to admit, I was mostly interested in how I;d look driving that beautiful piece of work, but as I got to know my car better, I realized I had invested in a good car. So far, I've had no problems with anything on the car. It gets wonderful gas mileage. About 27 mpg in the city, and about 32 on the highway. The gas tank is only 13.1 gallons though, which is pretty small. than your basic oil changes, I havent had to worry about any excess services or anything like that. And if anything does go wrong, which Acura predicts will only be long after you have bypassed 60,000 miles, its covered by my convenient extended warranty. 
  If you ask me, the exterior of the car is beautiful. The paint on all the new integras is great. I love how my car is a little old, but is still super shiny. And the 2000 rims are much nicer than the 2001 rims, in my opinion, because they look like performance wheels. The spoiler has the brake lights on there, which isn't necessary, but a nice feature to throw in. And then there is of course, the legendary headlights. Personally, I think Acura is making a mistake by changing those lights on the 2002 rs-x model, but that is just what I think. Acura threw in the moon-roof visor as an added bonus for me, which I think makes the car look even nicer. Overall, this is one car you don;t have to modify to make it look sporty.
  As for the interior of the car, I was a little disappointed with the tan & black mixture inside. But I suppose that's what happens when you buy a used car. The front seats are exceptionally roomy. Everything is conveniently located for easy access, with the exception of the cd player, which i think should be placed higher for the driver's benefit. But I do like the leather/ cloth combination that comes in the LS model integra. As for the back seat, I don't like the middle plastic piece. Nobody, even the people at Acura, can tell me the point of that. I think that is pretty stupid. There is hardly any leg room either. As for the hatch, I love it, because it can transport just about your whole house; it has so much room. This is really good for people on the move. 
  All in all, I'd recommend this car to anybody. It;s a great value for what you're paying . It's everything you could want in a car.
