            My family has always been big Porsche fans.  "German engineering", "unparalleled reliability", and "street ready race cars" were phrases I grew up hearing.  I couldn't afford one, so I never knew what it all meant.  That was until the day my mom decided she needed a power top on her 911 and I purchased their 1984 911 Cabriolet.  Bear in mind, this is not a turbo (they weren't even available in the US at this time).  It is a beautiful car, and fairly rare, so to this day it still turns many heads.  However, it is a car that you have to truly love to tolerate.  The heating system is barely works, and is controlled with 5 levers and a knob; it takes a genius to figure it out.  The interior and dash look dated, the gauges are the size of grapefruits.  The seats are very uncomfortable, the power windows barely work, there are no cup holders, no power locks (came later), and the rear seats are designed for small children or people you don't like very well.  The top in not only manual, but you also have to unzip the rear window first.  It also takes 12 quarts of oil; since I use synthetic, this is not a cheap oil change!  Parts are also very expensive; a routine tune-up (plugs, wires, etc) will cost well over $300 in parts alone!  Pay someone to do it and...well, we won't even mention it.  On the flip side, Porsches are VERY reliable, and rarely breakdown unless neglected.  
While this all may seem very unappealing to you, these features are expected when driving a classic.  Now I also had an '84 Corvette and it had a very modern interior, so Porsche was lazy to not get with the times.  But the '84 911 is basically a car that's been refined for decades, not a new design (like Corvette had done 4 times by then).  Driving a classic has its prices, but it also has its rewards...you're driving a classic, and people respect that.  They admire it, compliment it, women REALLY compliment it, and it also holds its value.  True, 210hp was decent power back then, but now-a-days it'll barely keep you ahead of most 4-bangers.  But even if that souped up Eclipse beats you to the stoplight, so what...they're in a Mitsubishi, and you're in a Porsche!
