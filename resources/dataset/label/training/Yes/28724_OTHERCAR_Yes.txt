            I bought this camera (3 months ago) for my 8 year-old daughter. She needed a camera that was simple to use, reliable and (of course) capable of providing good enough photos to allow decent prints to be made at my local camera store.

I looked at lots of cameras in this price range. The Olympus was not the cheapest 2 megapixel, but I've come to respect the company. I've owned a "pocket" Olympus 35mm for over 15 years and it still delivers great photos.

The Olympus D-380 hit the mark on several fronts:
   It's been dropped on every hard surface you can name without a problem yet.
   It has a lens cover (most others don't) that I'm sure will save the lens over time.
   No "zooming" lens or protruding flash to break.
   It has more than a few bells and whistles - all of which can be pre-set and forgotten for point-and-shoot ease.
   Prints made from the "high quality" setting (16 shots on the 8mb card) look very good.
   The USB cable allows your camera to be seen as a "drive" on any computer (i.e. in Explorer). You can download and upload JPGs (to the camera's card) without any extra software.

There are some misses:
   No rechargeable batteries (or way to recharge batteries in camera).
   Only an 8mb card supplied.
   If you use the LCD screen to compose your images, the batteries go quickly. (If you don't, the batteries have lasted us 2-3 months.)
   
I don't think it's fair to list the lack of optical zoom or lack of higher pixel resolution as cons; Olympus makes other cameras with these features, and I like the simplicity (and hopefully the added reliability) of fewer moving parts.
