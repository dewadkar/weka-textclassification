            I had sworn off buying GM after my '78 Chev Monza.  I hated the quality of the 231 V6 the Monza was built with.  The only thing that was nice about the car was its looks, and I punished GM ever since by buying anything else but GM.  That commitment to boycott changed when my brother dared me to test drive the 2000 Impala.  
I have owned my 2000 Impala for a month now, and I'm quite happy to begin with.  Fit and finish are excellent.  No flaws at all, to begin with. It's the first car I've had with no factory defects.  I love the looks of this car in every way, luxurious without going over the top.  It has a very competent grip on the road without riding harshly.  The quiet ride harkens me back to my fathers '65 Pontiac when GM claimed you couldn't hear the car running while cruising at 50 MPH. 
Here's the ironic part.  My Impala has a silky smooth, and fully powerful 3.8L V6.  In 1978 GM called it the 231!.  I'm glad to see that the General refined this power plant into something that doesn't run like a truck engine. What a difference 22 years make, I may actually become a regular GM owner once again.
Those who should buy this vehicle, is anyone who is looking for the maximum bang for the buck.  Chevy's mantra on this car must be &quot;Value-value-value&quot;.  The only people, buying sedans, who won't like this car, are only interested in the &quot;fire breathing&quot; V8's of a forgone era.  To all of you who trot out the tired old line about true Impalas being &quot;V8's only&quot;, well get over it.  My 6 cylinder Impala will out run the majority of the V8 Impalas of yesteryear.  This Impala is for sensible drivers, who are looking for a wonderfully appointed, family sedan of a car.
P.S. to the General... Pad the arm rests. I want to lean on them from time to time.
P.S.S. My '62 Impala had a 6 cylinder engine too!.<br><br>
