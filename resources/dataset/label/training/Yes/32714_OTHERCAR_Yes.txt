            I have always enjoyed driving big cars. I have written one opinion telling about my beloved Mercury Grand Marquis. As I stated in that review, when the Mercury finally broke down and we thought it beyond repair, we purchased a 1993 Lincoln Town Car.

I would NEVER by a Town Car new. The cost is just entirely too high, even if I could go in and pay for it in cash. You can buy a HOUSE for what it costs! They depreciate in value rapidly and really don't have a good re-sale value. I was told by the banker, that this is largely due to the popularity of SUV's.

So, it was that we were able to get a really good buy on this Town Car. I am so glad we did. It is all my Grand Marquis was and more!

If you want technical details about this car, you will have to read another review, or the manufacturer's page. I can only give you my perceptions and my opinion of the car.

The ride is smooth and the car is a dream to drive. It handles curves much
better than the Mercury. And I have become spoiled by all the little luxuries. In a glance,depending on which option I have selected, I can learn what the outside temperature is, how many miles I can drive before I need to refuel, or the amount of gas left in the tank. When you have 50 miles of fuel left, you get a warning beep and again at 25 miles and every 10 miles after that. You can also choose a read out of average mpg or instant mpg. There are two trip odometers.

Our seats are fully adjustable and comfortable. I do not particularly like the fact they are leather, for that makes them cold in the winter, hot in the summer and slippery all the time. However the good looks of the seats are easy to maintain.

Doing town and country driving, our car averages 22.50 mpg. which is a little better than the 20mpg the Mercury used.

Our daughter hated our Mercury. (I never did understand why.) When we let her drive the Lincoln she fell in love with it. She declared &quot;We HAVE to get one of these cars! I love driving it and there is plenty of room for the baby's car seat!&quot;

I almost forgot to mention the <i>keyless entry!</i> This is one of my favorite features. No more fumbling with the key in the lock. Just punch in the 5 digit code and it's unlocked. I don't rely completely on it, however. I always make sure I have my key with me in case the system quits working.

While I wouldn't recommend buying a brand new Lincoln, due to the prohibitive cost--unless you just LIKE spending a lot of money--I highly recommend buying a used model. Regardless of the year, you will get a much better price and a great car!
