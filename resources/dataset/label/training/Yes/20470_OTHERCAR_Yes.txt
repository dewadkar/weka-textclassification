            My parents bought me a used 1996 Chevy Lumina as my first car. Of course i was kinda dissapointed that it wasn't Ferrari or Porsche, but I was happy to get a car right away. Several of my friends also had Luminas of different years and they were happy with theirs. I got a totally standard package, no leather or cd or anything like that. I fixed the cd problem right away, an put in a panasonic cd player, twin 12" subs, and an amp. Even before I put the system in and I had the diskman attachment in I still got pretty good bass and sound on the factory system. The car handled pretty nicely, and the engine was sufficient... a 3.0 liter V6. The brakes and lights and all that were all pretty good, it come with ABS. The car is pretty big inside, too. It seats 5 people with comfort and the arm rest up front folds up to seat a sixth. The trunk was nice sized, I could still fit a lot in there even with the subs. The ride was ok, but a little loud sometimes without music. It didn't conserve gas very well, though. As a teenager yearning for power the engine really didn't cut it, but as a parent looking at this a suppose that's a good thing. I could still toast my friend in his Ford Contour. I had the car 2 and half years and it served me well. I lived in Green Bay, Wisconsin where I had some nasty winter road conditions, but my Lumi handle nicely. So this is an over all average, inexpensive, get-what-you-pay-for, family car.
