            I am not an expert. When I was looking for a car, I took my time and researched for several months, narrowing my search to the XG350 and the Camry.  Once I test drove this car, I didn't look any further. 

The first time I brought this to a carwash, the man who washed it thought it was a Jaguar until he saw the "Hyundai" on the rear end.  Its beautiful. 

I have the L version, with the moonroof and alloy wheels, etc. I wasn't looking for a sporty car. I wanted a comfortable reliable highway car with some luxury features. This car is luxurious inside and out, it has a lot of torque and passing speed, and it makes almost no noise.  You will have to get used to the immediate response from the gas pedal. It lurches a little from a dead stop until you learn to control your lead foot.

The car hasn't been perfect. I have had two repairs made to the car. 1. The trunk latch had to be adjusted because it wouldn't open with the keyless remote, this took about 10 minutes; and 2. The power steering pump was replaced, as it was causing a whine when I accelerated. The part took a week later than the estimate to come in, but the service department was excellent.
 
The seats are very comfortable. Leather seats are standard, and in my L version, seat warmers are standard in the front. The driver's seat is adjustable 8 ways and is very comfortable. I am short, and this seat moves far enough forward and low enough so that I can comfortably reach the pedals.  Although there is a left-foot-rest, I can't reach that. 

There is an option of automatic or "5-speed" transmission, but I haven't used it.

I drive a 200 mile commute on Monday and back on Friday.  The car is excellent on the highway, although it is a little floaty at high speed (over 70mph).  The traction control and anti-lock breaks are essential in my rainy climate, and have saved me from potential accidents more than once. The steering and traction control also performed well on a two week trip to the smoky mountains.

The hvac system is excellent. My passengers love the back seat air vents.   I live in Louisiana and bought this car in August, and I just traveled to the Smoky Mountains in late November.  Both the a/c and the heater performed admirably. 

The trunk is big enough, not huge. I haven't tried to sit three in the back seat, I imagine it could be cramped if anyone was bigger than average.

I like all the little features, like the trip counter (because I bill my mileage to my clients), the excellent sound system with CD and preset equalizer, as well as two sets of radio presets so you can preset for all the cities that you drive in.  It also has leather upholstery, faux-burlwood detail, a two level center console, a comfortable backseat armrest, and the gas-cap is attached by a cord (Wow! my last car was a '91 and I didn't know such things existed.)
Best of all, this car zooms when you press the gas.
