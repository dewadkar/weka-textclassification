            we purchased this car in September and it was the best we have ever gotten. it was a Demo and so the price was knocked down by $5,000.00. it had 5oo miles on it and it was brand new, no knicks or scratches in the paint either. Before this car we owned a New Yorker, another Chrysler and the had great luck with it. It held up to durability, and the car never broke down. What really made us decide to buy another Chrysler was the outstanding service we receive when it is in for a simple oil change..ect.
when you drive this car it is like driving on a blanket of pillows. you dont even feel a bump, even if it is a pot hole. I am very happy and I feel confident driving it knowing it is stable. I would say just about any one of all ages is able to handle this car. so go to your nearest Chrysler dealer and test drive one today... keep up the good work Chrysler.<br><br>
