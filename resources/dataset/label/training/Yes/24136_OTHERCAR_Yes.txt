            I just started using the HP Photosmart 620 Digital Camera.  This little DC is very easy to use.  It is a 2.1 mega-pixel camera that is great for well lit situations.  It is well suited for flat light situations as well.  When you are in low light to dark enviroments there is little feedback from the camera to warn you.  It automatically sets the flash when you go to shoot in low light enviroments.  The color LCD view screen simply looks black when you check it before you shoot.

There is just enough resolution to capture everyday snapshots that you can download and email to friends.  If you are looking for a consumer grade camera for print reproduction you might want to pay for a little more resolution and move up to a 3 or 4 mega-pixel camera.  But for capturing those birthday or special event snap shots of the family then this is a GREAT, easy to use, digital camera.  It is truly a plug and play tool for the amature digital photographer.

The camera interface is very user friendly even for the extreme novice.  Downloading is truly a one mouse click process and it can even upload the pictures automatically to you email account.  Along with the USB 2 cable for downloading your images there is also a USB direct dock on the bottom of your camera.  This allows you to place the camera in a docking station that is now standard equipment on multifunction printers and even some computers.

With the extended memory cards that are available the storage capacity of the camera is very impressive with over a thousand low resolution images being stored.

I use the 1800 milliamp rechargeable batteries that give me extra long camera life.  Under normal charge I get well over 20 hours of use.  If I rapid charge I get 5 to 7 hours of use.

With the extended memory card I can even take 30 sec digital video clips without sound.  I really didn't think much of this feature but have actually used it more then I thought.

There is also a 12x zoom on the camera that is one of the best I have seen in this range of cameras.

If I have to point out any thing I don't like about the camera it would be the lens cap.  After just a little use it started to NOT stay on the camera.  It tends to fall off in the least amount of pressure.

I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for easy to use, quality image capture and brand name benefits.
