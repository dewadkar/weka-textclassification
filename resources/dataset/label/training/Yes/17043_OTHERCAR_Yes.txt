             We bought a 1998 Dodge Durango to replace a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited that had an alignment problem that could not be fixed. We liked the size and were glad that the tire was not taking up lots of the cargo space but we are now getting rid of it and we can not sell it for what we owe on it.
 I think that the Durango does have some great features: the triple fold seat that allows access to the third row is the best that I have seen and one of only a few SUV's that has this option available on both sides. The third seat folds down very quickly and easily and stores within itself so it does not ever have to be removed. The front seats are very comfortable but the leather/suede combo is cheap. The third row does not fit adults or tall kids for extended rides. 
 The windows are small and have many blind spots. The Durango drives like a truck and is not a very quiet ride. The acceleration is less than that of the Jeep and the options are very limited.<br><br>
