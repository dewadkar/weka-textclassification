             Hey car lovers! The Pontiac Grand Am is the car with the most of &quot;everything&quot; packed all into one. This car is so versatile. It has a V6 engine, which is a plus.My particular model, 95 Grand Am has all the added features and it makes this car look like a limosiune compared to my old one. But if added features are not your thing, this car is great without it. The Grand Am is so reliable, whether you use it to get groceries, or if your driving across country. It's also great for any age group too. I own one and I am 19, my grandmother owns the 98 Grand Am and she's 75! Well, she's no ordinary grandmother though! I would also like to say that the interior of the car is sleek and attractive. It is very roomy too. Looks are deceiving when it comes to this medium compact car, the room inside (also trunk space) is great! In the back seats, there are built in cup holders, a must for any passenger car! This is the best car I have ever owned so far. It's a good American car. I used to think no American car can live up to the performance of a Nissan Altima for example, not true. The only thing I would say negative about this car,actually Pontiacs in general, is that when you hit the 50,000 mile range (odometer) one by one little things start needing repair. Other than that this is a great car recommended for EVERYONE! <br><br>
