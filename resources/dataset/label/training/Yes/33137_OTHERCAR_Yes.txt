            I like this car. It's got good looks and has some power
to go along with it's looks.
The Chevy Malibu I got has lots of trunk space and is
easy to load and unload because of it's low opening.

The car has 170 hp V-6 engine with plenty of power to
get me where I want to go. The only problem with the
engine is that it is too loud and can be heard inside
and outside of the car several feet away.

This car has a smooth stable ride making it easy to
ride over rough railroad tracks in comfort.
The cloth seats are comfortable and adjust to your needs well.

Leg room is very good in the front seats and in the back.
Although some of my taller passengers have complained about
the lack of head room. I'm 5ft 3in tall and I don't have
any problems with the head room.

There are plenty of cup holders and has one cup holder located
on the left side of the steering wheel for the drivers convenience.

It's got cruise control, a sunroof, CD player radio, power
windows and door locks including child safety locks.
Daytime running lamps, anti-lock brakes, remote keyless entry
and a digital odometer.
I have had a lot of trouble getting used to the digital odometer.
I'm so used to the old standard needle gage.

Over all this is a real sweet ride for the price!
