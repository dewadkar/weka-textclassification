            Much as I've tried to get some people interested in Epinions, it sometimes just doesn't work.  My mother is one of those people.  When she was starting to look at digital cameras, I tried repeatedly to point her to Epinions' section, but with no luck.  But when my grandfather, told her that he liked his Olympus D460 Zoom digital camera, that was all the recommendation she needed.  One was purchased and at home about two weeks later.

Then the camera sat around for another couple of weeks, because my mother has this thing against using gadgets before she's read the <i>entire</i> instruction manual.  (When she got her last new car in 1987, she wouldn't even drive it until she had read the entire user's manual.  I got a new car last year and have opened the user's manual exactly once.)

So when my boyfriend came to visit a few weeks later, the camera was still in the box.  We took it out and set out to learn enough about it to actually use it.

<b>Setting Up the Camera</b>

Getting the camera set up was really easy.  We just had to put in the batteries and media card and set the date.  The media card just slid in.  The batteries were a little confusing, because the special batteries that came with the camera didn't fit with the polarity that was marked on the camera.  But when we put them in backwards, they fit and everything worked.  (You can also use four AA batteries.)  Setting the date and time was very intuitive; it was just like setting most VCRs or digital watches.

<b>Taking Pictures</b>

Taking pictures with this camera is almost like taking pictures with just about any 35mm camera.  You just open the lens, point, and click.  There is a zoom function that zooms to three times the original size.  The main difference between this camera and most 35mm cameras is that if you want to have a flash, you have to flip the flash up and put it on the setting you want.  There are four or five different flash settings, including a normal flash, a red-eye-reducing flash, and a fill-in flash.  There is also a focus-lock feature where you can lock the camera's focus on something that is not the center of the shot.  The features work the same way as those found on Olympus 35mm cameras.

<b>Viewing the Pictures</b>

Once you have taken a picture, you can close the lens cover, turn on the LCD screen, and see the picture you just took.  With a single touch of a button, you can erase the picture, lock it in, or scroll through other shots you've taken (like if you took several shots of something and want to choose the best one to keep).  I am not quite sure what the purpose is in locking a picture, as all pictures stay there unless you delete them.

After we had played around enough with taking pictures, we decided to try our hand at viewing them outside of the LCD screen.  We used the provided video input cable to scroll through the pictures on the TV screen.  The manual said that you could also view them through the video input on the VCR, but we couldn't figure out how to get that to work in our short time that we played with it.

We also installed the provided software and downloaded the pictures to my computer.  It took a couple of tries to get this to work correctly as I wanted to download them to a place other than the default location, but it did work.  Printing them off was very easy, although I haven't yet played around with the print settings long enough to figure out how to change it from the approximately 6" by 8" photo that came out.  The only bad thing is that the camera doesn't come with an AC adapter (it's sold separately), so we had to run the downloading off the batteries, which is a great way to drain them quickly.

<b>The Camera and the Olympus Brand</b>

The camera came with an 8MB media card, which is good for about 36 high-resolution, JPEG-format photos.  My mother purchased an additional 64MB media card for when they go on long vacations.  This gives them 130-something high-resolution JPEG shots.

My family has always been pleased with Olympus cameras.  My mother has had an Olympus Stylus 35mm camera for about 10 years with no problems.  I've had an Olympus Stylus Zoom 35mm camera for seven or eight years with no problems.  If the trend continues, the product service plan my mother purchased for this camera will be completely unnecessary.

<b>Who Would Like This Camera?</b>

I think this would be an ideal digital camera for families.  We have a great number of pictures of special occasions where someone's eyes are closed, someone's finger is over the lens, or the lighting just isn't right.  This number was multiplied when we were younger, as my mother hurried to snap the shot before my camera-phobic brother wriggled away.  She never knew what the picture looked like until a couple of weeks later, when it was too late to recreate the shot if it didn't turn out.  With this camera's "instant replay," my mother would have had a chance to retake some of those dud shots that we're now stuck with.

The camera is extremely easy to use.  My parents purchased a printer and scanner at the same time as the camera.  If you've read my opinion on the printer, you'll know that it took about a week and a half of daily work just to get the printer to function, and I have installed other printers before.  In contrast, I had never used a digital camera prior to this one.  I had the whole thing, from setting it up to taking pictures to downloading them to the computer, figured out in about an hour.  Not bad for a digital camera novice.

As a final testament to how much I like this camera, when I saw they were on sale at Best Buy this week, I decided that I'm going to go out and buy one for myself.  Thanks for the recommendation, Grandpa!
