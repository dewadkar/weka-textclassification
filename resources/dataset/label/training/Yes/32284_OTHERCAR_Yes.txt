            I currently own a tornado red 1996 VW GTi Vr6.  

Before I purchased my vehicle I did extensive comparisons between the Acura Integra, Ford Probe, and BMW 318ti.  The deciding factors for me were the VW's speed, standard set of features (no expensive add-ons), style, and relative price.  Also important was that at 6'2&quot; I could comfortably fit in the car.

Things I didn't care about were rear seat room, trunk space, insurance costs, and gas mileage.  I wanted a car that looked good and was fun to drive.

The only options available were a CD changer and leather seats.  I didn't purchase the factory CD changer for 400 dollars.  A similar model from Clarion can be purchased for less then half that price and installed in 5 minutes.  I also declined on the leather.  I paid about 18,100 dollars for the car.

The smooth power and great acceleration are my favorite features of the car.  An aftermarket OBD chip removed the top speed limit of 130mph.  I believe the top speed is about 140~145mph.  The manual shifter has surprisingly long throws and the suspension is somewhat soft for my taste.  That being said there is a wide variety of aftermarket part to fix these problems.

The lack of good cupholders is a disappointment and I find the &quot;60/40&quot; rear seats don't collapse enough.  The trunk is adequate    

I have owned the car for 3 years now and have averaged 20,000 miles a year.  I get all the recommended maintainence done at the dealer.

The problems with the car that I've had included an annoying rattle inside the left door, the front left plastic air grill fell out, and the steering frequently went out of alignment.  The first two were fixed under warranty.  The factory Eagle GA tires are horrible for anything other then commuter traffic.  Replacing them with Dunlop A2s was a vast improvement.

Despite the problems the car is very fun to drive and comfortable for long commutes.  I would buy this car again given the choice.<br><br>
