            I bought my 1997 Cobra #1562/6961 in May of 1997.  It had 63 miles on the clock.  I LOVE this car.  I have been the exclusive driver of this car for the last 6 years.  I have almost 40,000 miles on the ticker now.  It drives great, had tons of power and acceleration is amazing.  The handling is good and the seats are comfortable.  I like the interior styling, it looks clean and smooth, and all of the controls are close and easy to understand.  It is so much fun to drive and handles the twisties just fine (unless there is a drop of water on the road).  The wet handling is terrible, but can be fixed with a new set of rubber (like the Firehawk SZ50 EP).  

Over the last 6 years, I have had very few minor problems with this car.  The dealer fixed them under warranty with no problem.  I bought and extended warranty and never had to use it, as all of the problems were within the first year.  If something does need to be replaced however, get your wallet out because it can be pricey.  Tires, brakes and rotors are all outrageously expensive.

There is absolutely no room in the trunk or the backseat.  The front seats are very comfortable with plenty of legroom.  No legroom or headroom is available in the back seats and the trunk is only 10 Cubic feet.  

I have since gotten married and had a child.  There is no room for even a car seat in the back and you can't even haul a large stroller in the trunk.  The price of parts is very expensive and a major drain on the wallet if you need to replace something.  If you are single with lots of money...this is the car for you!
