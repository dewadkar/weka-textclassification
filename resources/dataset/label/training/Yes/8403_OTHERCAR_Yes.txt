            We've had our Olympus D-600L for just over 1.5 years and it's served us well. A year ago, we brought the camera with us to Europe and it was extremely convenient. Each night, we uploaded photos to our Apple Powerbook, writing captions and freeing up storage space as we went along.

The D-600L offers three compression levels. At the lowest level (640x480), an 8MB SmartMedia card will hold about 100 images. At the highest quality, the same card will hold only 8 images. We've found that the medium resolution (24 images per card) works well for most situations, including making standard size photo prints.

The camera also has a built-in 3x zoom, built-in flash, and is threaded for wide angle and telephoto converter lenses. It's a solid camera, heavier than most point and shoot varieties. Its curved shape fits nicely in your hand, making it possible to take one-handed shots even given its fairly significant heft.

If you take any low-light photos at all, you'll want to use a tripod. The D-600L is <i>extremely</i> finicky in low-light situations, sometimes simply refusing to take the picture. We have managed to get some pictures in near-darkness with a tripod, but they took some manipulation in Photoshop to bring into proper contrast.

Other useful accessories are rechargeable batteries (a necessity more than an accessory), extra SmartMedia cards, and a floppy disk or PC card adapter. These last two make it possible to transfer data from the camera to the computer without use of the serial cable or Olympus' software. I highly recommend one or the other. It took hours of troubleshooting to get the software and cable to work the first time, but our PC card adapter was virtually trouble-free. That one accessory is probably in good part responsible for how much I like this camera.<br><br>
