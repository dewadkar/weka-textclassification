            The LX 470 has plenty of room and has a ride that quickly makes you forget you are driving a SUV.  Lexus has worked their normal magic in terms of making the ride absolutely quiet and smooth.   There is more than enough room for our son and his school friends and all their junk.  Every imaginable option is included, the sound system is great and the heating/AC works very well for everyone regardless where they sit.  

We were not sure we needed a vehicle as large as the 470, but one test drive and we bought it on the spot.   It handles remarkably well in traffic and is not a problem to park.   My wife drives it 95% of the time and has never had a problem with parking spots or parallel parking, thanks to the side view mirrors that dip down when in reverse.

As usual with Lexus, the only time you will see the dealer is for routine maintenance.   

This car is expensive, but worth every penny.  I have been in the Mercedes and a number of other similar SUV's - none compare to the 470.<br><br>
