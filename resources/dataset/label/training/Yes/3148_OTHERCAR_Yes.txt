            My mother and my little sister just got brand new cars. They both got Hyundais, against my inital discouragement. I had not really heard enough about them to make an informed decision. I think that they are actually a pretty good deal, now that I have had a closer look at them and the policies of the company. My mother got the Elantra an my sis got the Accent. they both seemed similar except for a small difference in the shape of the passenger seats. 

I had a broken leg when they were first purchased, and there was plenty of room in the car for me to strech out to a comfortable position. It has ok gas milage, and it has a really great warranty. Their commercials boast that it is the best warranty in the country. My mother got a good price on her trade in as well. Most car dealers do not do well in that area, but this dealer did very nice. 

I think that this car is a good deal, you pay for what you get, and maybe you get a little more than you pay for with the warranty.<br><br>
