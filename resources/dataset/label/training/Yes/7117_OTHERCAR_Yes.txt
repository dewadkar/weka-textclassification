            I found a low mileage &quot;1999&quot; Miata with the leather package (about which more below) last August, having thought long and hard about buying a limited edition 10th anniversary model. After 6 months, I have no reason to regret the choice. I saved a good $10,000, and frankly I prefer the tan leather to the blue suede of the LE. A year earlier, I had finally sold, with some regrets, my owned-from-new 1967 Austin Healey 3000; it had crossed too far into the maintenance/restoration vs. fun side. The Miata runs rings around the Healey in every category except maybe &quot;classic style&quot;.

Things to love: the handling, the Bose sound system, the A/C for when it's too HOT to enjoy top down driving, more than adequate power (with the 5-speed, and its neat stubby but quick shifter), the easy-to-lift top and glass rear window, power-everything (except seats...). PS - leather package subsumes most of the other available accessory packages, i.e. wider wheels, Nardi steering wheel, top Bose sound system, A/C, etc. &quot;It's got everything that Uncle John needs.&quot; OK, so the trunk is not very big, but it will take a largish carry-on type case and it WILL take a golf bag. It seems to have all the reliability and ergonomics that people have come to expect from Japanese cars (not to mention good influences from step-parent Ford). 

Minor drawbacks: The front-engine, rear drive configuration (with near perfect 50-50 balance) is, as BMW likes to stress, the best under dry conditions. FWD (and of course AWD/4WD) cars will do better when things get slippery. With the top up, there are some blind spots between the rear window and the side windows.

It's great fun to drive when you want to drive hard (even at expressway speeds ++), yet it's also easy and pleasant to drive for the casual Sunday drive around/into town. Almost a split personality (both good!)  

Only a test drive (and sit) will tell you whether this is the car for you. Either way, you'll know in the first 10 minutes. Make sure you go to a dealer or owner who will let you really drive it!
