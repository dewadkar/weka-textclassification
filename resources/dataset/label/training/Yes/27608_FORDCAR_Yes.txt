            As I mentioned in an earlier review, we purchased this vehicle for my wife. We have been 'proud owners' of our Escape XLt for a couple of months now and what a trail we have left.

Being a first year vehicle, we should have been a little more skeptical before jumping right in. Don';t get me wrong, the Escape is fun and a blast to drive........when it's not in the shop

We have been back to the dealer three times in the past 4 weekss for the same thing. The battery light flashes and makes a clicking noise, the ABS and brake warning lights turn on at their own whim, usually at 70 miles per hour on highway, darn near put my wife into cardiac arrest the first time.

Dealer says that no trouble codes come back on diagnostic computer and naturally they cannot duplicate these occurances, they must think we are nuts.

We have been back for our first recall, a windshield wiper module, which we made an appointment and then they could not perform becasue the module was not yet available.

The truck is great, and my wife enjoys the ride and I enjoy the fact that it is affordable, however, we are beginning to question the reliability.
Keep this in mind, be sure to ask questions before buying.
