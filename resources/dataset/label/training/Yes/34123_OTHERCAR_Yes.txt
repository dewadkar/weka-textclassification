            This just happened to be my first car.  It was a tale of love and hate.  The entire line of '91 Shadows must not be held accountable for my elements of woe because mine was purchased from an auto auction (for the bargain price of $800) rather than an upstanding car dealer (if such a thing is in existence).

At first the car, a manual was a dream come true...I was down on my luck and had to resort to the auction.  I did not know how to drive a stick before becoming the owner of this vehicle.  Learning was a cinch.  Two lessons out in farm country and I was a pro.  It had a very forgiving clutch.  It was almost as if the car refused to give up and stall.

For a time, I was blessed with reliability and great gas mileage even though it had already acquired nearly 130,000 miles prior to my ownership.  I drove the car for eight months before it had any real problems...but when it did...the problems would not be solved.  It had had its time in the sun and it was time to give up the ghost no matter what I tried.

While I had the Shadow (running) it was an excellent vehicle.  I know next to nothing about engines and the such but it seemed to run without a hitch and the space was just right for a single guy.

I would recommend this car to anyone in the $1000-$2000 price range.  <br><br>
