                 My experience with my Toyota Camry has been nothing short of excellent.  The Camry is the most reliable car I have ever owned.  In all the time that I have had my Camry, I have never experienced any problems with how the car runs.  It has never stalled on me, and always starts immediately, even in the coldest weather and even if has not been driven in awhile.  I have spoken with many other Camry owners, and none have had any problems either.  I have heard nothing but positive comments about this car.  I have only had the car for 4 years now and I have not had to change my oil yet.  The gas mileage is also good.  
     The ride is extremely smooth. I have a tendency to speed because the ride is never bumpy - even at high speeds.  The car is comfortable to ride in.  It's not cramped and the seats are comfortable.
     The added features are all decent as well.  The air conditioner and heater both work fairly quickly and the radio is good. My only complaint with the Camry is with the windows.  The tend to fog up easily, especially in humid and rainy weather.  They often take a while to defrost and the side windows can be nearly impossible to see out of at times.  <br><br>
