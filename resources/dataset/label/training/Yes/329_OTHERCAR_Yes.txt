            I purchased my '00 XE 4x2 back in Sept of '99 and have been driving it and loving it ever since. I chose the Solar yellow color for its uniqueness and for the attitude it exudes.

  While I agree that the V6 in the X could use a little more punch it still gets the job done more than adequately most of the time, I have put in and pulled out a 21' pontoon boat with it several times and mines a 4x2!.  *a word of caution* avoid the 4 cyl. model at all costs, the V6 is available in the XE as well as the SE trim levels so you don't have to pay the extra $2k for the few add-ons that the SE offers.  Gas mileage is not great but if you expect anything better in an SUV you should stick to a Rav4 or CRV (Not really SUV's in most peoples opinions). 

  The interior is simple yet extremely functional with pockets storage areas, and tie-downs everywhere.  Another great thing about the simplicity is most pieces inside (and out) are fairly cheap to replace. There is plenty of room on the inside, front, back and cargo areas.  I've never had a passenger complain for lack of leg or head room in the back, including my 6'2&quot; dad!  Most passenger actually like the back seats as they are a bit higher than the front so you can see out the front windshield.  The only negative aspect of the back seats is the wheelwell hump which intrudes a bit into the entry thus making it a little less accessable to those who are not quite limber enough, but this is a minor quirk. 
 
  As for the exterior, I believe it sells itself, I have used the     roof-rack for everything from boats to furniture with no problems, the only reason it is limited to 125lbs is due to weight distribution because anything more would make the vehicle too top heavy and in danger of a rollover. 

  As for the driveability of the truck, I love it.  My dad has a '99 Expedition and my mom a '01 X5 and I still believe the X has a better and more stable feel than either of those.  

  The X was not designed to be like all the other SUV's out there, that is the appeal of it.  I can throw all my junk in it go out in the woods for a week and not have to worry about putting a tear in an expensive set of leather seats.  If it gets dirty then so be it (kinda looks better like that anyways ;-).  The point is if you are looking for something to haul the kids back and forth from soccer practice or the mall then pretty much any of the station wagons on steroids most manufacturers tout as SUV's will do, but if you want something that will get you away from the kids, soccer practice and the mall then check out the X.  It really can't be beat for the price. <br><br>
