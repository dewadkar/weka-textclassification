            What a steal...  That is what everyone else was telling me.  I was happy with my car, it looked really nice, and had good acceleration.  My reason for buying this particular vehicle was because a month before, an elderly man ran a red light and smashed my truck.  I was stuck without a car, and this was the nicest thing I could find.  I am very pleased with my 1992 Nissan 240SX.  Not only do I look good in my vehicle, but I also feel good in it too.  My windows are a deep dark tint which adds to my dark forest green paint.  A true winner!  The previouse owner was going to jail and needed money for the lawyer, so I purchased the car for very cheap.  My final cost... $2,600!!!  This car still has under 95,000 miles, and looks brand new and I have had it for over 4 months.  I get 26 miles to the gallon in town, and 32 on the highway which is a definite improvement from the 13 both ways in my truck.  The cd player and speakers in my car sound great, and the AC keeps me cool.  I truely love my car!!  But, with every used car, you have flaws.  The driver side window has a slight gap in it so when I wash the car, water leaks in.  It is an annoyance, but I am willing to live with it.  Another this is that the trunk does not open with the key, or the helpful switch on the driver side.  I am planning on fixing this problem, but with two people you can easily open the trunk.  The back seat is hard to get into and out of.  For teenagers, or adults, the seats are too small in the back.  The passangers in the front must slide there seats up so the persons in the back may have room.  Despite these disadvantages, I recommend this vehicle for anyone who loves awesome looking cars which need low maintinence, and drives smooth.<br><br>
