            The Jeep Cherokee is a very nice car that anyone should enjoy having.  I bought it because i loved the way it looked and the way it drove.  Its got a great structure and drives as smooth as any suv youve ever seen.  I also bought this because of its low price.  It had the most reasonable price for anything else in its league.

I love the jeep because it has enough room to pack up and leave for a vacation or to fit a large group of people in it to go to a party to whatever you want to do.

Anyone who is looking for a good quality vehicle should look at this.  Its got all the room you need and can carry a good number or people.  This could be a good car for a teenager who is just looking for his or her first car or someone who is just looking for a good suv.<br><br>
