                 Digital cameras have come a long way in just a few years; I had the chance to find that out when I used the Kodak DC-260.  Simply put, the picture quality is superb; not only is it leagues beyond the quality of formerly entry-level digital cameras, the picture quality is competitive with 35mm film cameras.

     Just a few years ago, an entry-level digital camera was one that took pictures at 640 x 480 resolution.  Such a camera cost at least $600, and was fine, if all you wanted were pictures of &quot;acceptable&quot; quality, and no larger than a post-it note.  Enlarging them the least little bit (heaven forbid 2x-3x enlargements), and you'd find your pictures had degenerated into heavily pixilated, abstract art renderings of the subjects you photographed.  No more.  The Kodak DC-260 takes splendid, highly detailed pictures that stand enlargements beautifully; you can easily print pictures the size of file cards, and larger, and still have them look sharp and pixel-free.

     Color saturation is another superior mark of the pictures you can get with the Kodak DC-260.  Even under poor lighting conditions, colors are rich and accurate; with adequate lighting, objects are robustly colored and have good contrast with their surroundings.  You won't find anything even remotely like the pale, pastel colors of the instamatic cameras of yesteryear, especially Polaroid's offerings.  

     The Kodak DC-260 is a very painless out-of-the box experience.  Even if you don't consult the operator's manual (I didn't), you can figure out how to work all parts of the camera, and take great pictures, in about 10 minutes.  Thankfully, most everything looks and works like a standard film camera.  About the only important skill you'll need is a pair of steady hands for taking pictures.  You don't even have to focus the lens; that's automatic.  You do get a choice for taking either wide angle or close-up shots, but even that's painless.  

      Naturally, one of a digital camera's greatest advantages is getting to see the pictures you take just seconds afterwards.  Like many other digital cameras, the Kodak DC-260 has a small screen on the back for displaying pictures.  If you goof, or just don't like the picture you took, you know immediately, and you can try again.

     The camera does have some disadvantages, but they are relatively minor.  Foremost is its tendency to devour batteries.  Even if you're flush with cash and don't mind spending $4 for a pack of 4 EverReady alkaline batteries, they won't last much more than an hour and a half of constant use before they're drained.  I'd strongly suggest getting rechargeable batteries; get 2-3 sets of them so after one's exhausted, you have another ready to go for more picture taking.

     Other disadvantages include the camera's low capacity 8 MB memory card.  It's only enough for about a dozen high resolution pictures.  You'll likely want to buy another memory card, with as much storage space as possible.  You may also find the delay between the time you press the shutter button, and the time the picture is actually taken, to be annoyingly long.  It seems to vary from a fraction of a second to a second, and not just because of the lighting.

     Overall, the Kodak DC-260 is a superb camera that will take fantastic pictures, and it will provide excellent, flawless service for years after its warranty has expired.  I can't imagine a better camera for the money.<br><br>
