            If your just getting into the digital imaging thing and you'd like an easily accessable camera with little or no difficulties, this would probably be one of this best cameras out there.  This camera has a 640x480 resolution, which yes is less than one million pixels, but its really good for printing those standard 3 1/2 x 5 shots and even some 4x6 depending on the lighting conditions.  This camera runs on a rechargeable lithium ion battery (and yes the charger is included) and it uses the standard 3.5 floppy for film!  You simply take the pictures and when your done simply stick the disk in your floppy drive and download them!  Its that simple!  No cords or ports needed!  And you don't have to worry about buying bigger disks for the camera.  This camera has a 10x optical zoom to take nice close up shots and comes also with a neck/shoulder strap.  I would recommend this camera for any beginner who wants the convenience of easy use and easy downloading.<br><br>
