            In 1963 I bought a brand new Vet right off the showroom floor. Saw it only once and couldn't live without it! What a beauty she was. Then I got sent off to Guam, so it was sold. Again in 1965 I saw one and had to have it! This one went when the family started growing. Infant seats just didn't fit in too well.I was still in my early 20's, so it wasn't a &quot;turning 40&quot; thing. I just wasn't happy being without one. The sleek lines, the fuel injection, the speed, the ride, and the fact that very few people owned one!!

In 1997 I tried again. And this time it might have been an &quot;over the hill&quot; thing!

Corvettes still had a look that I loved, the body was still fiberglass with wonderful lines. But what happened to the rest of the car? 

They came out with the T-top that never fit quite right once you removed it. The engine, though still an 8, had lost much of it's get up &amp; go. The paint jobs, which were always pristine, were now straight out of the factory. the interiors had become rittzy and cheaply done. I look, I saw, I bought, I was sorry. My 1997 Vet only lasted me for about 4 months before the problems started showing up. I am one who 'babies' my cars, so I know the problems were not of my doing.

Why can't a product stick to a good thing once it's found? Production mottos for 2000 go something like; Produce it fast &amp; cheap ~ Quality be damned! I wish I still had my '63 or '65....now those were classics!!
