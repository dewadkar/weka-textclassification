            There are many good and bad things about the Sony DSC-P51 digital camera. The camera itself is fairly inexpensive and comes loaded with options that other similarly priced cameras just don't have.  For example you can set your ISO from 100 to 400, or put it on Auto. This is a feature similarly prices Kodak&#146s don&#146t have. They have a max ISO of 140. Auto however seems to only select 100 no matter what you are taking a photo of. The LCD screen is also much clearer than others I have seen on cameras. The flash is bright enough to light up a room, and I have yet to have a problem with photos coming out too dark due to the lack of flash. This camera wasn't meant to take video so don't buy it because it says it on the box. The video looks more like a few pictures put together to resemble a video, and there is no flash while recording so you can be almost guaranteed that the movie will be dark. Also with no sound, there's almost no point to recording videos. Don't think that this camera is not worth the money though. 99% of the pictures come out with amazing clarity and they're great quality. The automatic lens cover is nice, just turn off the power and it sides out and protects the lens. The most annoying thing about this camera is the auto focus; it takes the camera a second with an orange light to focus the camera on objects before it takes the picture. If it doesn't focus correctly or what you were taking a picture of moved, it's almost guaranteed that it will come out blurry. This light can be turned off, and you can also set the focus manually, but I wish the auto-focus feature could have been designed better. However this camera takes pictures far superior to my fathers Kodak DX3500 which is similarly priced. Overall the camera is great; it is well built, takes great pictures, comes with many options, and is well worth the money. If this camera is within your price range I think you should seriously consider it. Sony has produced a great camera that is far superior to others I have seen in this price range.
