            Being the car enthusiast that I am, I probably buy and sell more cars in a year than most do in 10. I am always on the lookout. And since I have this special need for self gratification, if I see something I like, I usually go for it. Problem is, I usually get tired of these toys just as fast. 

So on a recent outing I spotted this 1994 Grand Am SE.
At first site I was impressed with its looks. Candy apple red, chrome wheels, rear spoiler, power everything, and low miles.
I took the vehicle for a test drive and spotted one immediate major problem. At speeds between 45 and 55 MPH, the transmission would hang. The vehicle would buck and tremble violently. Let me point out that this problem didnï¿½t turn me off  from buying, it simply gave me the buyers edge to negotiate a much better price. I knew what the problem was. Like most GM models in this class, the transmission has a lock up on the torque converter. After time these converters go bad. Usually on these vehicles between 30-50 thousand miles. This is a problem notorious in this series. The cost to fix about $200 at a tranny shop. Well worth the $1,000 off the already low ball price I stole the vehicle for.
 
This Grand Am came equipped with the 2.2 4 cylinder 3 speed automatic transmission. The engine is very peppy, and reaches highway speeds in seconds. Outstanding steering control and sports handling package, along with 60 series low profile tires made this car a real pleasure to drive.
Front seating is comfortable, leg room is fine. Rear seating is useless.

Equipped with an air bag and standard ABS, adds safety comfort.

I would highly recommend this vehicle for anybody looking for a sporty looking vehicle at a reasonable price, especially the college bound or single people.

I would not recommend this vehicle for people who are not handy around cars. This vehicle will develop problems and without proper knowledge could cost you a near fortune in transmission repairs alone.
