            I have a 98 Eddie Bauer Expedition and have to say this is the PERFECT vehicle!  I have two young children and this vehicle offers all the room I need and more.  I am a woman and have no trouble maneuvering this vehicle around corners and into parking places despite some of the reviews here stating that the Expedition was difficult to maneuver.  I have also never felt as if the vehicle would roll while turning a corner and have never encountered any blind spots in my many excursions.  

Noticeably there are many critics who have thought it necessary to leave their opinion here although they have not driven an Expedition.  Their complaints range from the Expedition being to big for the road to being to dangerous for other motorists.  For one thing, SUV's are not going anywhere, and there have always been big rigs around, they just haven't been classified as SUV's.  If you people don't like being in a small car then get an SUV...otherwise stop your whining! Concerning the gas mileage, It costs me $30.00 to completely fill my tank from near empty.  If SUV owners want to spend more money on gas then that is up to us. It is a person's choice what kind of car they want to drive and how much money they want to spend.

I would recommend going with the Eddie Bauer version if possible all the extras are worth it and it looks much nicer.  In the two years which I have had this vehicle I haven't had any mechanical problems whatsoever.<br><br>
