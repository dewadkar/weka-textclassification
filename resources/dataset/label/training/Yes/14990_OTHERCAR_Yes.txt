            The Sony MVC-FD73 is extremely easy to use.  Since the 3 1/2 inch discs are the same size that you have around for your computer anyway, once the disc is filled up, you just take it out of the camera and insert it into the computer. With the play back feature, you never even have to put the photos in another format to view them, or to share them with others.  I have a gift shop, and use the camera to update my board on changes that are going on in the store. Being able to take photos at 10:15 and share multiple photos with a board at 10:30 is just incredible. My only complaint is the resolution is not what I could get with my old Nikon camera. But, then I would not have gone to the trouble and expense of taking pictures constantly with the Nikon. The most exceptional thing about the purchase of this piece of equipment, is that I have had it for almost a year now and still use it all the time.  <br><br>
