                 The Chevrolet Cavalier, an American staple in the automobile industry, continues to maintain its economic pricetag while continuing to raise its bar of performance and dependability.
     
     I drive the 2.2L. 5-speed, 4 cylinder, at 115hp is a bit sluggish.  Not that the Cavalier has been known to blow the doors off the competition, but in a time when &quot;compact&quot; cars are increasing the ponies under the hood, the Cavalier is still lagging behind in this area.  Still, the power is adequate enough to get you on a highway and pass cars comfortably.

     Another area of concern is the interior cabin noise.  Most of the time coming off the line or passing on the highway, it sounds as if you are revving a motorcycle or a powerboat.  It can get extremely loud in the cabin, but to its credit not nearly as loud as a 1995 Honda Civic, which my girlfriend owns and it makes my ears explode.  Of course, being an economy vehicle, this is not the emphasis on its design, so I wouldn't discount this vehicle because of that.

     The fuel economy is pretty standard, falling way behind the imports in fuel mileage.  For a compact car, the 24/34 you get with this automobile doesn't seem to be enough.  When most of the imports are getting 30-40, the Cavalier doesn't stack up.  Of course the price tag tends to cost you about 2-3000 less than the imports.

     Among the other pros and cons, the Cavalier is one of the few vehicles left that offers a convertible option, but only through the 2000 year model.  The Z24 engine offers more horsepower and allows it to compete with the foreign sport models now out on the market.  Craftsmanship and durability are decent, I noticed the tweeters on my 99 and also on the 93 one I owned both blew out within the first 2 years, so be aware of some of the &quot;cheapness&quot; inherent in this car.  It does offer ABS brakes, which some cars in its class still don't offer standard.  

     Overall the Cavalier is still a decent value.  I bought mine for 13,000 after tax, for a 5 speed, base, w/air.  I would lean towards recommending this vehicle, but it is very important that you keep up with the maintenance on this car.  I would recommend this car to someone looking for something basic, cheap, and American made.<br><br>
