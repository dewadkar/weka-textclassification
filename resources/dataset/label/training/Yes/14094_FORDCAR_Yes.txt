            On the 30th anniversary of the birth of the Mustang, Ford did a major revamp of its classic pony car. In 1994, Mustang loyalists were worried that the front-wheel drive Probe was going to kill off the Mustang. They needn't have worried because the Ford engineers did wonders with the 30 year old platform and created a very capable 2+2 sports coupe. I leased a Ford Mustang LX, 5-speed manual for 2 years.

Engine:
The 3.8L V6 was very smooth and torquey. Mated with a heavy-clutch 5-speed, the Mustang takes a bit of getting used to - especially as the clutch action is so heavy.

Handling:
Since any V8 Mustang spelled a skyrocketing insurance premium, I was delighted at how sporty the V6 was - especially with the 5-speed shifter. Handling was very firm with slight understeer. Prior to this Mustang, I had a first generation Probe and I was impressed that I couldn't tell if the Mustang was front or rear wheel drive thanks to its almost neutral steering.

Interior:
The revamp for 1994 introduced the wonderfully retro interior that features the twin-cowl dash design that looks a bit like the classic 1964 Mustang dash. Dashboard ergonomics are perfect though, when equipped with the 5-speed, the cup holder is useless.

Rear seats are for kids only though they get to sit up higher than any GM pony car (Camaro or Firebird).

Exterior:
Great design is both modern and retro - with the side scoops reminiscent of the 1964 car. You can also get an assortment of aftermarket wheels to freshen up your Stang.

Quality:
I had no problems with the Mustang for the 2 year lease. Mechanics at Ford told me that they continue to prefer rear-wheel drive cars as they are more reliable and easy to repair than front-wheel drive. The fit and finish were superb. Interior materials were all of quality.
