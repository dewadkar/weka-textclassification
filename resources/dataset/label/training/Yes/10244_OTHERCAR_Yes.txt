            The Lexus RX 300 is a fun, comfortable SUV for the driver and the two back side passengers. However, the front passenger seat is lacking in lower back support as well as vertical adjustment in order to accommodate short or long legged passengers.

The middle back seat is highly uncomfortable for any passenger, be he a younger child or grown adult. The seat is not padded and the back thrusts the body out at an uncomfortable angle.

If the owner of the RX 300 made the switch from a mini-van, the space restrictions can be difficult to become adjusted to. All back-packs, lunch boxes, toys, etc., MUST be put into the rear to allow for leg and arm room within the body of the vehicle. This can be problematic if the owner of the vehicle has made a previous visit to the grocery store, hardware store, etc.

The Lexus RX 300 is a beautiful, quality car, easy to handle and fun to drive. A person interested in purchasing this vehicle must weigh the pro's against the con's and decide what is best for his or her family.<br><br>
