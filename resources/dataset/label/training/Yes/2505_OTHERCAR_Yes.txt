            I've owned this vehicle for about 20,000 miles now (now at 70,000), and its exceeding my expectations. I have a fairly equipped model, however, the biggest downside is no power locks/windows. Other than that, I have everything I need. CD player, auto tranny, 4WD, power mirrors, tinted windows, blah, blah, blah.

As I always do whenever I buy a used vehicle, I immediately give it a good tune up. This means change the plugs, plug wires, radiator flush, tranny and transfer case flush and fluid change, check belts, etc. Who knows when this was last done and it will make sure I know when to start counting the miles. Other than that, the only thing I've had to replace on this was the oxygen sensor. That disappointed me, because I had to replace it at 68,000 miles and usually they are reputed to last until over 100,000. No biggie though. No other mechanical problems (knock on wood, as always). 

Some say the interior is bland but I see it as being part of the vehicle's ruggedness. This is not a BMW X5. It is a Jeep Cherokee. If you want all the latest and greatest styles, colors, bells and whistles, this is not the vehicle for you. But if you do need a $40,000 SUV, at least stay with the Jeep family and get a Grand! :-) 

The Cherokee was basically designed to be an off road leader of SUV's. It was built to take you almost every place its cousin, the Wrangler, can take you. If a grocery getter is really what you need, yet you still blindly NEED an SUV, get an Explorer or a Blazer. Those vehicles were not built to be taken off road, despite their "truck" status. They are made with weaker parts, and sacrifices were given to make the ride more car-like. The Cherokee is a truck and that's that. Don't expect to whiz around corners in this vehicle either (although the 190 hp engine will make you want to). There is some roll to the body. But once again, its a truck. 

The factory stereo system is a big disappointment. But then again, like the tune up, the stereo system is the next thing on my list when buying a used car. Roll your windows down in the summer and expect to crank up the volume and hear horrible distortion. I replaced my factory CD player and speakers with aftermarket components, and although I had to chase down and eliminate quite a few rattles in the interior, its now a thing of beauty. 

I am 6' and I wouldn't want to be any taller. I have a couple friends who are 300  lbs, and they have to squeeze into my front seats. Forget about even trying to get them into the back seats. 

Since the Cherokee has been discontinued and the gruesome Liberty is in its place, I plan on paying this off (2.5 more years!) and then buying another Wrangler to replace the one that died on me just after purchasing this vehicle. (Jealousy, perhaps??) I do plan on keeping this vehicle, however, until it dies. I'm a Jeep man, what can I say.
