            I have never been happier with a purchase as I am with my CLK 320. After thorough research I set my mind on the CLK and I was right... The car is a beauty, handles perfect and is not shy on the road. It picks up vigorously and hugs the road with command. Everything inside is designed for comfort and convenience. Driving it gives me a high, no kidding, it is an ecstatic experience and the thrill never fades. Now if you are looking for a sports car that's aggressive and nervous, the CLK is not your bet. It is a bit of stretch to your wallet if you're cash strapped, but you have the bucks, the CLK is an investment. With a decent driving record insurance is no worry. Buy it if you love it and plan to spend a few years cherishing it. If you're the &quot;get bored quickly&quot; type does not, the investment is a bit too hefty for a short-lived fling.

Pros: Comfortable ride, great acceleration and wonderful esthetics.
Cons: a bit pricey and only comes in automatic.
