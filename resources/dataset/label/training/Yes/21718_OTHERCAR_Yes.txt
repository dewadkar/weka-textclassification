            My Cavalier is a '98 model.  After shopping the 1999 <i>new</i> car market which I originally intended to buy...searching and searching again even in a 100 mile radius, test driving over and over again all the various compacts of all the various manufacturers and also surfing the web....I chose the Cavalier.

All choices being equal within the price range of my budget; comparable pricing, warranties, comfort and features...I chose the Cavalier. I intended to buy a new 1999 model, however I found a used '98 model which was still in a one year window of being new and still under the manufacturer's warranty.

I was lucky though.  I found this '98 with hardly any miles at all, the previous owner did not have children to leave food and drink stains behind, they didn't smoke, and as I already mentioned, was still under the GM warranty...my cost: $10,000...(Great price for my neck of the woods).

The 1999 models, no difference between '98 &amp; '99, was approximately $14,000-$16,000 depending on options and where it was being sold.  I saved $ 4-6,000.00 by choosing the '98 model. It was a no-brainier-hands-down choice for me.

My dream vehicle of preference is, and has been for years, a Jeep Grand Cherokee (Limited of course!)..But the price is beyond my budget, dreams and expectations for now. That's why I chose to search for a compact in my price range that was comfortable and reliable too and not really being partial to any one particular manufacturer...I was open-minded to that option.

The Cavalier gets great gas mileage in the city running routine daily errands and excellent gas mileage on highway trips. It is easy to drive with a strong steering suspension and good brakes that stop on a dime, even in rainy weather. It is very reliable with zero trips to the repair shop (so far in the nine months I've owned it...), has extremely comfortable, thickly padded seats for a compact size car, especially to comparable models which I've found to be very <i>hard</i>...did I tell you even the back seats are comfortable too? (compared to the seats of the competition's equal models...argh!....My butt hasn't <i>that</i> much padding!) The Cavalier is kind of sleek looking in it's own place of the respectful category of compacts.

If you have a budget, want comfort and reliability for your money, the Chevy Cavalier is worth the try.  I compared this model with other manufacturer's counterparts in the same price range and there was no comparison for the money, comfort and reliability of this size car.<br><br>
