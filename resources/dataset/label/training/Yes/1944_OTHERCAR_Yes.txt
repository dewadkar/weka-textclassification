            I truly believe that the Maxima stands alone in its category. After taking my wife to drive Hondas, Toyotas, and Passats we could not ignore the exhilaration we felt after driving the Maxima. We leased a Maxima SE super black automatic. Where do I start?...


 Engine: it is truly a masterpiece, it is SOOO smooth, tons of low end torque and as you start picking up speed the engine is quiet and composed. It is no wonder Ward's keep calling the Maxima's engine the best V6 in America.


Exterior: This is subjective, but I like the looks of the Maxima, it is different and bold. This car calls attention and it stands out in the crowd.

Interior: Everything is essentially where it should be, the seats are SO comfortable. There is plenty of room in the back for adults to travel comfortably.

Ride/handling/Fun factor: Some say the ride on the SE is rough....I say, this is a sport sedan, and it rides and handles like one. I look forward to driving it every day!...just watch your speedometer...it's easy to speed in this car, I've already gotten a ticket.

Reliability: A big issue for me....my Maxima is now a year old and it operates like a swiss watch. I've only visited my dealer for oil changes and that is just the way I like it.

Stereo: I don't have the BOSE, but I think the stereo is one of the best that I've experienced.

A few minor peeves: The black paint is a scratch magnet--I've gotten my share of those already. If I had to do it again, I would have gotten a lighter color. I think some of the plastics could be of better quality, but they do not detract from the enjoyment I get from this car.

IF you love to drive and are looking for a sport sedan under $30K, the Maxima should be the only and obvious choice.<br><br>
