            A diehard Chevy fan I honestly don't know why I forked out the big bucks for this truck but I think it was a combination of looks and Cummins reputation for indestructible engines.  Now that it's done and I've gotten 60,000 miles under my belt it's safe to say that I've been converted.

I use this truck for a wide variety of purposes from farm utility vehicle to recreational camper toting, boat pulling, and chasing all over the hills and mountains during hunting seasons, AND hauling the wife to town in comfort and style.  It performs admirably in all respects.  Above all I love the fact that I can load up the camper, hook up the boat and still get 15+ mpg.  I love the fact that it can pull that load up the canyon with no problem whatsoever and no line of cars stacking up behind.    
Comfortable, I once drove from Logan Ut, to Seattle WA in one day arriving fresh as a daisy.  This truck is a pure pleasure to drive.  Rides remarkably smoothly for a big four-wheel drive, comfortable, responsive steering, tight turning radius (I have the extended cab model and my wife maneuvers it with no trouble whatsoever, even in town...   60,000 miles and not a hint of trouble.    After nearly 40 years of driving (I started really young) this is my all time favorite vehicle.  

Nothing's perfect however and there are a few negatives here.  The stock Michelin tires are practically worthless.  They have a hard time getting a grip on pavement let alone mud and snow.. easily fixed with a set of new tires and now she climbes like nobodies business.  About the only option we didn't get on this truck was power mirrors and I should've because every time you adjust 'em they're looking at the ground again in about 20 minutes.   Lastly, I hardly ever get to drive it because my wife always has it.
