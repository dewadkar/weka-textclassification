            When our 1990 Ford Aerostar [see my review for that van as well] was involved in an accident. My dad decided to get a new van while the old one sat [later giving it to me.] Weve always been a an of Ford products. So we decided to get a Windstar. We would have gotten an Aerostar but Ford stopped making them. Overall, the windstar is an ok van. The thing i like best about it is the 200 horse power 3.8 engine. The van is suprisingly quick which catches some of those rice burner Hondas by suprise. The other upsides are comfy seats and easy radio controls. The downsides are minor but many. There is not much room in the back and the bucket chairs are hard to climb over [ i would recommend the bench seat,] and the interior panels dont even line up right, one was even falling off but i smacked it hard enough to get it to pop back into place. The transmission is a tad clunky for a new car, especially if youre parked on a slope. The windshield wiper controls are located on the turn signal which cause them to go off sometimes. Being a new van i dont know how reliable it is, it seems like it will need lots of minor repairs in the future, theres 20000 miles on it now and nothing has gone wrong yet. Overall its a good vehicle, I still would rather drive the Aerostar and i wish Ford would reconsider making them.

UPDATE! 12-15-2000....So far this month We've gotten about 19 inches of snowfall. This van handles snow very well, sure i do get stuck sometimes but doesn't every vehicle? I've seen cars and trucks stuck on my block in a big snow bank, with a mild press on the gas this van can plow right through, also, it doesn't slide very much making if fairly easy to control.<br><br>
