            This vehicle gives you everything other over priced SUV's in its class give.  For example a toyota 4 runner costs more, and you get pretty much the same car in a pathfinder.

The SUV handles well, it hasn't given me any problems in the two years I've been driving it, and it looks great.  Get it in black, a must.  Other colors don't look as good in my opinion.  It comes standard with CD player, auto locks, power steering, power windows.  Things which are not standard on many SUV's 

I'm not a car buff but from a layman's perspective I think I got the deal of a lifetime.

The only poor thing about it is gas...and no matter which SUV you get your gonna pay for the gas.
