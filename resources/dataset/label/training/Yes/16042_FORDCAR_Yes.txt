            I just recently bought a ford escort because of the style of the car.  This is a new type of car for my family.  I think the car it's self is  roomy and smooth riding. This ford escort is really good on gas. I recently took the car on a short road trip, You don't hear much road noise.  Any one who is looking for a good dependable car should look into getting one except those with to small kids wish are in car seats.  The only problem I had with it so far is that the radio volume will get louder then it wll go real low.<br><br>
