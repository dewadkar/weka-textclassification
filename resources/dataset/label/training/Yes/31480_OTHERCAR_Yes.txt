                 Working in the camera business, both in sales and also a photographer, I would have to give the Agfa 1280, 2 thumbs up!  Not only is the resolution the highest for the money, it is the most user friendly camera you will find on the market today.  

     This camera has a LCD screen that lets you view what you are going to take a picture of as it will show up EXACTLY!  It has all of the flash modes anyone who has normal use of a camera will ever need.  The fill flash makes for a perfect picture every time.  

     All of the other cameras I have ever looked at have a million buttons that are almost impossible to learn, which means you have to take your manual with you at all times.  The Agfa line (not only the 1280) have a dial and 3 buttons, a shutter button and two buttons that allow you to maneuver through the options such as flash and &quot;save&quot; or &quot;garbage.&quot;  

     As far as transferring to your computer, I have never had a problem.  The software that comes with the camera is basic and as easy to use as the camera.  You will find that MOST digital cameras will not even come with any software period, so Agfa is really ahead of the game.  As you become more comfortable with digital cameras, you may need to upgrade the software, but for normal use and beginner use, this camera and software will fit you like a glove.

     One other feature that hardly any other digital comes with is the rechargeable batteries.  Digitals go through about 4 AA's every hour of use, so it can become expensive, but along with the power cord you can plug into any outlet, the rechargeable batteries are an excellent benefit!<br><br>
