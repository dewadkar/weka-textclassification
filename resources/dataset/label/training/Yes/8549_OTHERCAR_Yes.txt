            I have owned the Toshiba PDR-3300 over a month. It is absolutely the best value feature-for-feature of any 3+ megapixel camera today.

The PDR-3300 is an easy to use point-and-shoot camera. But, it also has full manual mode for those who like to be in control and fine tune the camera for the best picture under varied situations. Most cameras in this price range (and even higher) provide only limited manual control, if any at all.

Before I purchased, I was concerned that the PDR-3300 did not have a separate status display to show camera settings and remaining pictures. This information is displayed on the LCD monitor on the PDR-3300. I have, happily, not found this to be a problem.

I use a SanDisk 128mg SD card. Some people have complained about problems with this particular card. It is not a problem if your camera's firmware is version 1.04A or higher. My camera shipped as version 1.02 but I easily upgraded the firmware with a download from the Toshiba web site.

One thing puzzling to me is the fact that the PDR-3300 only uses SD cards and is not backward compatible with Smart Media cards. I don't know why Toshiba chose not to support either card as some other cameras do. However, I believe the SD card will soon replace Smart Media as the new "standard."

Some reviews mention minor problems with the autofocus. I don't find this to be a huge problem; definitely not something that should stop anyone from considering this camera. It seems to happen in extremely low light or in macro mode. I am learning how to compensate for this and am hoping Toshiba will improve this in a future upgrade to the PDR-3300 on their web site.

In my opinion you must have a pair or two of NiMH rechargeable batteries and a good charger or you will spend a fortune feeding your camera alkaline batteries. This is not a negative comment about the PDR-3300 but is pretty much the case with any camera that uses AA batteries. I ordered the MH-C204F charger and batteries for a reasonable price from Thomas-distributing.com. I found this specific charger highly recommended on the internet by many users. I would agree with what I read and would also recommend it.

I have had prior experience with two digital cameras. My last camera was also a Toshiba, the PDR-M60 2 megapixel -- also a great camera, but with limited manual adjustments as well as the obvious megapixel difference.

I challenge anyone to find a digital camera with all the features, ease of use and quality of photos at a price anywhere near what the PDR-3300 is currently selling for.  

Guess you can tell I am happy about my purchase.
