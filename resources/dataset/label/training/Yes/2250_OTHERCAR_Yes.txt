                 Hyundai has, and will have for many years, the reputation of a second-rate car dealer.  It's a simple fact in the automotive industry that bad reputations can form overnight, while good reputations take years of effort to develop.
     The Hyundai Tiburon (read: &quot;shark&quot; in Korean) presents a radical departure from the days of the Korean manufacturer's small, blocky cars that were more problematic than my statistics class.  Gone are the angular lines and the unenthusiastic design of Hyundai's past.  In their place is a car so superbly designed that it seems to flow down the road, and looks like it was carved out of a single piece of sheet metal.
     Indeed, what a welcome change.  My brother took a chance on this small, sporty coupe and hasn't looked back since. The Tiburon's 140 hp DOHC engine provides more then adequate power, and while the zippy coupe certainly won't win any drag races the sheer variety and quality of the features (coupled with the excellent price tag) make the Tiburon place 1st in the quality department.
     The car handles like a dream on the curves, and inside the cabin you'll experience a remarkably quiet ride.  At times it feels more like you're gliding over the pavement than driving over it. The gas mileage is quite good, and coupled with the safety features and excellent Hyundai Advantage Warranty, this adds up to one car you'll love to drive around.
     It should be noted, however, that there are a few glitches in the model. For some reason the left front speaker in our CD ETR 100 watt system goes static when tuned into the local FM station. As well, the rear bumper (rubber coated over with a very smooth paint) chipped extremely easily when we barely bumped a parked car.
     Despite this, the Tiburon has far surpassed our expectations.  My brother loves this car so much that he's already put over 7,000 miles on it.  Given the sheer quality of this asphalt maco, I'm sure we'll see many more miles in our sharp Tiburon.<br><br>
