            Do you need a truck?  I mean, do you need a durable utility hauling vehicle?  This could be the truck for you.  The Tacoma's big selling points are its excellent fit and finish, and its near-legendary reliability, which are important if you need a dependable workhorse.  However, many people--and you might be one of them--use a truck like they'd use a car, mostly for getting people from place to place, and getting groceries from the store to your house.  If this is you, there are probably better choices.

The Tacoma is decidedly rough around the edges.  In-town driving can be rattling, especially where the road surface is less than perfect.  And the bucket seats are too firm to be much help.  The back end, when unloaded, has a tendency to hop up and down, and the truck feels tippy even in ordinary cornering.  Gas mileage isn't great (I average about 20), but not a lot less than other vehicles in the same class.

This truck shines, though, when it gets down to business.  The 2.7 liter Four gives ample power, and the five-speed gearbox shifts crisply.  While the box is a bit small for serious loads, the ride gets much better with, say, 500 lbs of gravel in back.  Off-road, the Tacoma goes where it wants, though you'll need to see your chiropractor regularly.

This truck has been a great second vehicle for my family, used mostly for pulling a boat or hauling home-improvement supplies, and only occasionally for getting around town.  If you're looking for something that will function as your primary wheels, you might do better with a truck with better manners, say, the Ranger.  The Tacoma is too expensive (even used) and too clunky to be enlisted as a grocery cart, but if you need a truck for doing truck jobs, you won't be disappointed with the Tacoma.  Given its solid work ethic and durability, my Tacoma will be with me for a long, long time.
