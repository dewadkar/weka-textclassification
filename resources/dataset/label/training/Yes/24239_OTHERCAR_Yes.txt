            I love my jimmy. I Have a 1994 blue SLT jimmy 4x4. I love it, i bought it a year ago and it had 79,000 miles on it and now it has 102,202. I like my car alot but i have had some major problems. A week after i had it, i broke down because my EGR valve and PCV valve went out. it cost me $575 to get it repaired. But it was ok, i fugured it was just a maintence problem and it would be fine. Then 2 months later my heater core ruptures and explodes leaving every ounce of antifreeze in my radiator all on my floorboards. so i ended up spending $336 on that, and the other day i went to go get my brakes done and they tell me that my brake callipers have locked up and that they are not going to last much longer..so that is going to cost me another $300. and on top of that. my EGR valve has gone bad again!..but even after all of this i still like it and have no intentions of getting rid of it.The four wheel drive is great also, i have the electronic shifter and all you have to do is push a button on the dash. it doesnt get that much use with snow, considering that i live in jacksonville florida!...but it does go through alot of sand!..well it has some problems but it is still a great reliable great car.<br><br>
