            My parents are true believers in Toyota. They have owned 3 Camry's in the last 7 years. I guess you could say when a new feature comes out on one they trade their's and get the new one.

For as long as I can remember they have always owned some kind of Toyota. Even when we were kids which consisted of 5 girls, they bought the ugly little space mobil looking van. It was not cool to drive especially in high school but, I can say they never had any problems with it.

After all of us kids were grown that is when they traded their van and bought their first Camry. I have drove it on several occasions and I find it to be really comfortable s well as roomy.

I lived in Arizona until October of last year and my parents, sister and niece drove out to visit me . Which they live in  North Carolina, so it was a 31 hour drive. They were really pleased with the performance of their Camry on this trip and also the gas mileage.

They have not had any problems with it and could not be happier with their purchace. So if you like Toyota's give the Camry a try.
