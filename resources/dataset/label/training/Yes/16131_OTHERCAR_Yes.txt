            I have been driving this vehicle for three months now and it has the most comfortable seats and ride of any vehicle that I tried for this years models. I was looking for a luxry model car and just took the Jeep Grand cherokee for a test drive. it handled and rode better than any of the other cars that I had tried. It has a real smooth ride. it handles very well, and it is a very quiet ride. I am getting between twenty six and twenty seven miles to the gallon. Realy good mileage on regular fuel. I live in a rural area and it has been a real reliable car on ice and snow which we get a good deal of here in New Norway. I have always drove large cars and thought they were real good on handling on wet or icy roads but the Jeep sure put that myth to shame. Not only does it handle well but I get great milage in four wheel drive when I have to use it. I would recomend this car to anyone who would like comfort and convenience as well as economy. I consider this car well worth the dollars I spent on it. <br><br>
