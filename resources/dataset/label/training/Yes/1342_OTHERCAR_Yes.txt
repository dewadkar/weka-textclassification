              I bought the Chevy Silverado for my company for the transportation of tools and equipment.   
  
  I must say that this stands up to the test when it comes to hauling heavy equipment.  I was amazed that a truck with a 6 cylinder 4.3 vortec engine could pull so much weight.  Also how much more space there is now in the new Chevy Silverados.  Also that the new style of the Silverados is very eye catching.  The only downside I could really see about the Chevy Silverado was the price.  To pay 25,000.00 for a 6 cylinder pickup truck is a lot money.  I feel that a great number of people would look at the price and and then automatically think it was a 8 cylinder engine they were getting for that price.

  The Chevy Silverado drives like a any truck would.  If anybody thinks they are buying a truck for a nice comfortable ride well maybe they should think about buying a Lexus.  I must state that Silverado did handle itself notably in bad weather conditions.  

I feel that people that are looking for a stable pickup should buy this type of truck.  Generally construction workers, this would be an excellent work truck have.  Well as for the everday car shopper, spending 25,000.00 on a truck is a lot of money.  I feel it would be a waste for a car shopper to pay that much money for a truck.  It would only be beneficial to the car shopper if they were going to regain some of the money they spent on the truck.
