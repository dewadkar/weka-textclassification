            I have owned my 2 Door Chevy Blazer with the ZR2 Offroad Package since Oct of 2000 and I love it.  I had a small convertible before the Blazer and was a little nervous that the size would be difficult to get used to.  I was wrong!!  It is easy to drive and has a great turning radius compared to the other SUV's I test drove.  Drives like a car but works like a truck!!
I have the front seats with the high head rests which makes it a little hard to see behind you at times but you get used to it.  The seats have lumbar support that you can change with a simple twist of the dial and that really helps on long trips when you get tired of sitting.  The driver's seat also has electric controls that allow you to configure the seat in any way you want.  
I also have the external spare tire that is attached to the back with a large hinge.  It blocks a large portion of the back window so that is another thing that takes a bit of getting used to when you drive in reverse.
The only con I can think of is that the back seat is a bit small for a SUV of this size.  If your passengers aren't too tall they will be quite comfortable but if you anticipate having people in the back seat most of the time, you may want to look more closely at the 4 door model.  The back seats do fold down which really helps with storage area when you are transporting large items.
I also have the Auto 4Wheel Drive option which has proven to be very helpful.  You can switch to Auto 4WD and 4 High with just the push of a button and to switch to 4 Low you simply shift into Neutral and push a button as well.  This is a great feature when you are in mud or snow and really don't want to have to get out of the car and change something on all four tires.
We take this on long road trips over the mountains from Seattle, WA to Idaho and it handles great.  It is very comfortable and the road noise is barely noticeable even when you are driving at highway speeds.
The only thing that could make it better would be better gas mileage...Tends to be a bit of a gas hog.
