            I have bought a 10 year old Discovery V8i 3.5, 98000 km, for work in the mountains and on the farm. I am very happy with it, it is big enough to take two children and the dog to school and then fit 6 workers and drive to the site in comfort. Its only cost failing is petrol comsumption 20l / 100km. 
To drive it is not unlike a luxury car on the road but with added height, but off road it comes into its own, enough power but with control for most but the ridiculous.
I would suggest finding an automatic or automatic differential lock version, as off road you sweat between controls/neutral/gears/pedals/brain in slippery or difficult situations.I love the fact, with the winch I have never felt uncomfortable off road/on road/winter/summer. 
I would suggest a Discovery to those in the country who need both a practical family car and be it weather or work or just conditions who need a reliable 4x4, or those who enjoy off roading or just for the fact it is a great car.
It is not a car to be treated like a racing car and can envoke fear by those whom drive it without respect, it does have power and if well maintained is extremely quick for a large car but it is dangerous even deadly especially for those not in the car it is not a toy - it is both a tractor and a limosine.<br><br>
