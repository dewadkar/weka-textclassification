                  This vehicle was a great encounter for me and my family. From my old car this car seems like heaven.With the leather interior and  smooth driving i think i could live in this car. The wideness of the grand prix is good but not great.Pontiac overrates the wideness but u will still see the handling is great.
       The looks are nothing to be ashamed of.The aerodynamics and nice interior makes this car look great from inside and out.Also with cd player i could ride in this car and never actually get bored.
       I wouldn't compare this car to a camareo but it is a good car.Not real fancy and not real expansive.You can buy this car if you do not have a lot of money of even if you do.
      I hope you like the car as much as i do.I recommend you to buy the grand prix.<br><br>
