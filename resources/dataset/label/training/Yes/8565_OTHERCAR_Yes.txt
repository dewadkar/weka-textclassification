            I bought my Grand Am GT in 1996, and I still have it.  I used to trade cars all of the time, but I love this car.  I don't have a new one.  My car is a 1994 model.  It is teal green, and it has all of the great features.  I haven't had any problems with this car at all.  It is very roomy with comfortable seats.  The great thing about this car is that it can be a great family car, or it can be great for a single person.  It is very sporty looking.  I don't have any complaints about this car at all.  I am thinking about getting another Grand Am in a newer model.  I would highly recommend this car to anyone!<br><br>
