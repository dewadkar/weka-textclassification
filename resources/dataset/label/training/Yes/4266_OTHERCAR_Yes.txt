            I have just recently bought a BMW 540i .  It is a luxurious car with everything fully loaded into it.  <br>Let me start of by telling you about the 3 series: Its around 25 to 35 thousand dollars.  Is it actually worth all that money? Not if you wanted to be judged.  BMW is classified and seperated to series (numbers).  The higher the number the more its worth and the better accesories and parts you will get. BMW M3 is the last BMW you would want to get! Its not bad but its just not worth it.  I would recommend you save that money and buy yourself a 540.  <br><br>       BMW 540 is the first car of the V8 category.  You get all leather, sun-roof, 6 cd changer , navigation system ( very very fancy) , A V8 ENGINE!! , and around 285 -300 horsepower.  But my favorite accesory is the butt warmer!! Just press a buttom and the seat heats up. there is another 5 series the &quot;528i&quot; but you wouldnt want to get this because its 3 thousand dollars less than a 540 V-8 engine but the 528's engine is a 6 cylinder (V6) engine and around 230 horse power.  It is not that luxurious.<br><br>So the next time you want to impress some one important or showoff your rich, just cruise down the street in a 540 and you will get a better impression. <br><br>Base price:54,650<br>0-60 mph- 5.7 seconds<br><br><br><br>
