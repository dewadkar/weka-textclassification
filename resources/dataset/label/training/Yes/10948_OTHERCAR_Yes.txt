            Having driven Beemers in both UK &amp; USA, I really like everything about the car.  This is one sturdy baby that still looks stylish enough to please anyone.  This was a comfortable machine when we were a family with active young boys and now when there are just the two of us left.  Most important to me was all round vision and a feeling of security when I was out on my own with young children, especially in fast moving traffic.  Only drawback was when 'macho' men drivers saw it was a female behind the wheel, they felt obliged to beat me at every move.  Generally, I just left them behind to 'eat my dust'.  I wold recommend this vehicle to just about anyone from up &amp; coming young exec trying to make the big impression, to families who need plenty of cargo space for carrying around equipment to empty nesters who just want extra comfort and something stylish to be seen in.<br><br>
