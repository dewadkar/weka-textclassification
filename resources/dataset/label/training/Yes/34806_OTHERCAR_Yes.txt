            Do you want a REAL SUV? Consider a Land Rover. After experiencing problems with lesser vehicles in severe conditions I will always have one as a utility truck. Without question the Discovery 2 is the best by far! 
The first sensation I noticed is the increased stability of the new version. Here in northern Nevada the winds are unusually strong and affect high profile vehicles adversely. With this truck the wind is not a factor at all. Another pleasant surprise was the higher build quality of the truck. Many of the small problems that plagued my other trucks were not to be repeated.
 One other observation, the real reason to purchase this truck is value. The features (such as the heated windshield) and abilities of the Discovery match or exceed my first Range Rover Purchased in 1990. Not only will it do everything the early version Range Rover could do, the Discovery does it better with more comfort and build quality than before. The final kicker is it cost half the price of a new Range Rover!
In 28,900 miles I have had one bad manifold gasket and one bad plug wire. That is the extent of my problems with the Rover. The only thing I wish for would be the turbo diesel option as available in the U.K. That engine delivers 34 Mpg! This in contrast to the 18mpg of the gasoline version. 
To maintain reliability I run Royal Purple synthetic oil, use K and N air filters and run Bosch 4 electrode plugs. The combination of these three elements seem to improve mileage a bit. Happy Hunting!
