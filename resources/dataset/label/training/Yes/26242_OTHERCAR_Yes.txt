            Price: 

An expensive car but worth the price.

Engine:

Fantastic compared to my last car that was a Mercury Mystique.

Transmission:

The transmission is pretty fast, the gear stick is neat.

Leather:

Wow! The leather is Xtremely comfortable. It came with gray leather, not black. Black leather is too hot during the summer. There are heated seats in the front to make you cozy in the winter.

Exterior:

I love the neptune blue metallic exterior color.
It has a very neat shape. It looks like it moves the best when you look at one on the road.

Rear Backup Camera:

This is very neat, I can see what is going on in the back of the car on my navigational system screen.

Navigational System:

Better than Honda's. It knows just about anything. But the only Borders it listed was in ann arbor Michagen.
This really helps, without a navigational system I get lost.

Audio:

I love the 6 CD Changer, it is very fun. There is also a cassete player so I think it's the best of both CD and cassete. Lexus has its own radio stations that keeps updating.

Automatic Hatchback:

This is a feature no other SUV has ( maybe the Chrysler Pacifica but Chryslers are not good). The Hatchback opens in one press on the key or car, no need to reach.

Multi Panel Moonroof:

The moonroof is nice and easy to open when it is nice outside

Light Washer:

Another neat feature is that water spays two the light a few inches away from the light.

Dealer:
I go to Dave Mungenast Lexus in the St. Louis Missouri area. The service is great, thy gave me unlimited free car washes, unlimited bagles and drinks, 3 free key chains, 2 free hats, and a free portable coffee mug.

I love the all new Lexus RX330
