            You can't beat trucks for sheer customizability.  The Chevy S-10 compact pickup is no exception.  &quot;So what'll ya have on that there, eh buddy?&quot;
You can custom-order a truck for exactly what you intend to use it for.  Regular or extended-cab? Flareside or flatside? Short or long bed? Four or six cylinders? Two-wheel or four-wheel-drive?  And I'm not even going to get started on the interior options.  The S-10 is a prime example of flexibility in a vehicle.  No other type of vehicle gives you this many options.

It was with this in mind when I test-drove my 1999 Chevy S-10 flareside extended-cab V6 4x4.  The truck was actually fairly well-behaved on the highway, with a relatively smooth ride.  However, it gets a bit wily on unstable conditions with nothing in the bed.  The back end might try to jump around on you a bit, so be careful.  This is, unfortunately, the nature of the beast.  over 60% of the truck's weight is resting on or just behind the front axle.

As I said, the vehicle I have is eqiupped with GM's Vortec 4300 4.3L OHV V6, producing more than enough horsepower to move this little truck.  Unloaded, careful manipulation of the throttle is required to avoid spinning the rear tires.  You're best off starting in second gear, unless you're pulling a heavy load.  Since there's so little weight to be pushing around, this truck accelerates very strongly, and I've yet to want for power.

The interior was comfortable, as well.  The plastic used in the dash and doors was of a good quality, and the CD stereo in my truck sounds great.  The cloth buckets are easily adjusted to keep you comfortable, and the AC blows VERY cold, an asset here in New Mexico.  If it weren't for the bed in back, I'd almost say it was a car.

The truck is also equipped with push-button four-wheel-drive, which is very easy to use.  Off-road in 4-hi, the truck handles itself well, tackling most novice trails with little to no effort.  It's not a hard-core off-roader, though there's plenty of stuff on the aftermarket to make it one.

All that power comes at a price, though.  This thing sucks gas like it's going out of style, but again, this is the nature of the beast.  If you bought a truck, or are even considering one, gas mileage is probably not a major concern.  If it is, though, adding a cover to the bed will help quite a bit.  And if you can't afford that, just drop the tailgate for the same effect.

To be honest, this is a great little truck.  If it's not enough for you, then you'll want to look at the Silverado.  But as far as compacts go, it's about as good as you can get, which in this case is pretty good.<br><br>
