            Worth every penny.  I bought the camera mostly because it was cheap and seemed to have the features I wanted.  Now I am new to the digital camera thing so I really don�t know what good is, but so far I haven�t been disappointed by the 650.

Now I did have some problems, but as far as my research is telling me they are fixable.  The first is the problem of battery life.  The batteries it came with only lasted some 40 pictures, about two thirds using the flash.  This was not good so I did some research and found out that NiMH rechargeable batteries are the only way to go with digital cameras.  So I bought myself a pack of 1500 mAh batteries and did a little test.  They passed, after 90 pictures WITH flash it went to low battery, not no battery, LOW BATTERY.  PLUS they only take 8 hours to charge up and they can be charged thousands of times.  So if you have a digital camera do yourself a favor and spend 30$ on some NiMH batteries.

Another thing is the lack of zoom.  But this isn�t a huge problem because the camera will accept 37 mm lenses.  So if you already have a set of those you are all set.  I don�t, but I will probably get some soon.

As far a picture quality goes,  I think its quite acceptable, everything is clear and crisp.  And printouts look fine, when I blow them up to fit a 8x11 glossy page you can see the blockyness, but if you print it smaller its hard to tell between the digital photo and a real photo.
