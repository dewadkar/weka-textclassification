            I received this camera from my husband for a Christmas present this past year. When I read the box and it stated all the features I was sure it would be complicated.  It wasn't though.  It came with 2 instruction manuals, Getting Started and Advanced Users Guide. The guides explained 'how to's' in English terms and in no time at all I was taking pictures, transferring them to the computer and printing them.  

The Epson PhotoPC 750Z has several resolution settings ranging up to 
1280 x 960. The pictures can also be taking in black and white. It comes with an internal 4mb-memory card.  A removable memory card can also be inserted into the bottom of the camera for greater amounts of storage.  

One feature that I like a lot about the 750z is the continuous shot.  My kids play hockey and I need this feature in order get action shots.  It is easy to set and works great.  I can move the camera while taking up to 16 pictures in 8-second intervals.  

The 2-inch screen in the back of the camera is very clear.  I take most of my pictures through this feature.  It also makes it easy to review the pictures that you have taken.  If you don't like them it is simple to erase the ones that you don't want and make room for more.

There are several buttons on the back, don't let this scare you.  They are easy to use and most of the time the screen will tell you which one to push.  Once you get the hang of what they are used for you'll realize how simple this camera really is to operate.

The 750z can be connected to your computer or television to view pictures or even take pictures.  I really like this because I can get a better view of the image I am photographing.

The software that came with this camera has many options available for improving the pictures.  Most of the photos we transfer to Adobe because we find it more user friendly.  I would have liked to receive a manual on the software that came with my camera so I could get the most out of it.

The camera also came with rechargeable batteries and case.  This is very economical because when I've used regular batteries they get eaten up fast. 

The Epson PhotoPC 750z comes with 3x Optical Zoom.  I must admit that I've had better zoom on other camera's but I wouldn't let that hinder your decision to purchase this product.
