            Growing up in the late 1950's and early 1960's, nothing stopped traffic like a British sports car.  With the top down and the wind in your hair, it was about as much fun as one could have with one's clothes on.  The BMW Z3 2.3 Roadster recreates all of the fun of the British sports cars, and provides the latest of creature comforts such as power windows (remember side curtains?), power door locks, air conditioning and more.  It also has more curbside appeal than any other car on the planet.  At every gas stop, people ask questions about the car, even though it has been on the market for almost 4 years.

Enough about flash, the car has more than enough substance to answer any question that it is a true sports car.  The original 1.9 liter 4 cylinder engine was banished forever at the end of 1988.  In its place resides the 2.5 liter silky-smooth 170 horsepower 6 cylinder engine from the 323 series.  Even with the base engine, with 181 ft/lbs. of torque available, and the standard 5 speed manual transmission, the car will do 0-60 in 6.9 seconds and has a top speed of 128 mph.  It handles as if it is on rails,in part because it has in incredibly light curb weight of 2,899 lbs. and its 51%/49% Front/Rear weight distribution.

It is extremely difficult to find a competitor in this class at this price point.  One can spend more money on a Porsche Boxter and obtain a greater level of performance, albeit at a $50,000 price.  A basic 2000 BMW Z3 2.3 Roadster will list for $31,870.  Even if you load it up like our test car with a Premium Package, Heated Seats, In-Dash CD Player, Fog Lights and Chrome Interior Accents, the car listed for $34,980.  In this class, that is a bargain.<br><br>
