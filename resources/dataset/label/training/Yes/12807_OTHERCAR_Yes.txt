            I've been using my Canon S20 for about 2 weeks now, and have had time to take hundreds of pictures. The detail is outstanding. I work with digital images for web sites, small scale print, and poster size print (50+ MB file size). I take a lot of pictures and spend LOTS on film and developing, then scan the images for digital use. With the intoduction of the digital cameras I have checking them out but they seem to fall short for file size and quality, but now with the 3+ megapixel cameras, the quality is catching up with film cameras. 

There are a few things that I required in a digital camera. (1) It had to be pocket size, as it will be used on my snowmobiling adventures and other limited space situations. (2) Quality of the pictures, detail is a must. (3) Easy to use, must have good point and shoot capabilities. 

After using the S20 for a while, here are some of my opinions. The camera is built very well, easy to use, and has an automatic lens cover (no plastic cap on a string)- very important! I do not use the digital zoom, but the optical zoom is great- would be better if it was 3x- but if you take a shot with the large setting, you can get enough detail to make up for the 2x zoom. Color is a little on the cool side for shots using the flash, the more natural light you use, the better the colors will turn out. Pictures of sunsets and outdoor shots turned out very good to outstanding. The battery life is good, I was able to take almost 100 shots with the rechargeable battery (sold seperately) with the LCD screen turned off. I still have to put it to the test this winter to see how it reacts in below freezing temps and high contrast (snow) scenes, but with what I have seen so far, it should be excellent. 

All in all, I would highly recommend this camera.
