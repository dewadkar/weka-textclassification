               <b>C</b>apitalizing on the past 60 or so success of the Jeep name and heritage, Chrysler launched the Jeep Grand Cherokee for 1993. It's a large, luxurious, all purpose automobile, and is also capable of the sort of high out-right performance normally associated with many modern sports cars.


<i>Driving Impressions;</i>

     <b>E</b>quipped with a 245 horsepower V8 engine, the Grand Cherokee can take on all corners with the acceleration to rival some modern sports cars. Furthermore, it does not roll through corners like most off roaders such as the Jeep Wrangler or the older Jeeps. Ride quality is also good; even in rough conditions. The 4x4 system makes light work of difficult terrain such as Moab Utah. Inside, the Grand Cherokee Limited is fully equipped, better than many luxury cars on the market.

    The <b>Grand Cherokee</b> boasts awesome pulling power. While the Cherokee is available with a 4.0 liter 6- cylinder, the Limited has the throaty growl of a 360 ci V8, which dates from the 1960s. This engine also powers the midsize Dodge Dakota, Durango sport utility vehicle, and the full size Ram pickup. In the Limited it produces 245 HP, and has a huge 345lb-ft of torque output. This large engine enables the Grand Cherokee limited to pull a trailer of up to 5,000 lbs.

    The <b>Grand Cherokee</b> has a car like construction. The Grand Cherokee boasts Chrysler's uni-frame structure, a monocoque body/chassis mostly crafted from steel. The Quadra coil suspension consists of live front and rear axles suspended by coil springs, with anti roll bars at both ends. Low pressure gas filled shock absorbers are standard all around.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

     The <b>interior</b> of the Grand Cherokee is more luxurious than most any sport utility fan could ever ask for. Super supportive seats are added which aid in aggressive driving; no falling into your passenger's lap with these seats. The seats in the Limited are made with rich leather and offers plenty adjustments. The Grand Cherokee has full instrumentation, and features such luxuries as power seats and climate control. One thing I did not like with this luxurious interior was the relatively dated dash. It seems as though a '98 modeled vehicle should have had a more modern front dash fascia. The post 2000 models seem to be much more modern.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

     The <b>exterior</b> is less boxy than previous models. Instead the exterior design is more sleek and handsome, giving this sport UTE an upscale appearance. The front grille adds a nice touch to the Cherokee's stylish stance. The Grand Cherokee is also very aerodynamic with a drag coefficient of 0.45 ( according to specs), this makes it one of the most aerodynamic sport utility vehicles in the world for the 1998 model year. 

<i>Pricing:</i> 

    The <b>price</b> for these vehicles are still high, but in this case, you get what you pay for. You get luxury equipment, 4-wheel drive, and 0-60 times in the mid 7 second range ( according to specs). When was the last time your Cadillac could do all of that for you for less than $40,000?
