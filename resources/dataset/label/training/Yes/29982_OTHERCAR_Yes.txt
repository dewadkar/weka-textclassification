            The ABS braking system on some of the early 1990's Dodge minivans and light trucks have been a constant problem for owners of those vehicles.  A recall has been issued, but often the new parts fail just as the old ones do.  Dodge has just begun to cover all of these ABS failures for the life of the vehicle under warranty.  This is great news for the vehicle owners as the typical cost of fixing the problem is over $2000.00.  We recently had the brakes repaired on my Dodge Grand Caravan and had absolutely no cost for the job, best news I've had in a long long time!<br><br>
