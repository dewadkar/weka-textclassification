            Edited November 14th 2003: 
I incorrectly stated that this car has a Mazda engine which has been pointed out to me as a false statement.
I was led to believe that this version had the Mazda 323/Protege engine but it is in fact only the chassis that is from Mazda.
Sorry if I confused anybody here.
*End of Edit*


Well in the first place I have to admit I am a "Jap" Car fan first and foremost. The only reason I looked at a Ford Escort was due to the Japanese (Mazda) chassis (Ford/Mazda joint venture) and the American domestic depreciation factor.

I was looking for a used car for a friend of mine the past week or so and after looking at numerous botched, clocked, trashed, excuses for cars we finally found the car we (and most other people!) were looking for in the shape of a 1999 Ford Escort SE 4 Dr Sedan.

As a foreigner in a foreign land I find it amazing just how abused used cars can be in the USA. So I was very happy to come across the fabled (In America anyway!) "Old Ladies Car" which I have been lucky enough to find on several occasions back home in Scotland/U.K.

This was a 26,400 mile example, which, in the words of the owner, "I only use it to go to Publix and back".

When we turned up at the owners house I was actually expecting to be be very disappointed but on the driveway was an unwashed white Escort that had NOT been prepared for prospective buyers.

After a good inspection of the car and a test drive of a few miles I was convinced and we drove off $4,000 dollars lighter in the pocket.

So what do I think of the car then?

Well this car is virtually as new and as a result everything is pretty much as it was when it left the factory. After a good wash and polish it looked like it had just left the factory too!

The build quality of the car is pretty "light" I would say but everything appears to be well enough screwed together. The interior is very plastic and hard in general.
The fit and finish of the exterior is pretty decent and I have no complaints about panel alignment etc.

Starting the car reminds me of my mothers Mazda in the UK - the engine note sounds very similar indeed. However, I must admit that the engine in the Escort does not feel as refined as there is significantly more vibration to be felt when the car is idling.

Driving around town the car is quite nippy and is not disappointing at all. On the highway the car zips up to 85-90 MPH without any trouble at all and cruises quite happily at this speed.

The only negatives I'd suggest at this point are, the feel of the car at speed is what I would describe as "wooly" and can easily be buffeted by mild side winds. 
My personal preference is for tight handling cars and in this respect the Escort disappoints. 
The actual ride itself is very decent/smooth but the handling is not as taut as other similar Jap compacts. 

The other niggles that I have are the intrusion of engine/road and wind noise at speed. The driving compartment is not particularly well insulated at speed but I'm sure turning the stereo up would counter those complaints. 

The stereo is actually pretty good but this one only has a radio/cassette so "102.5 FM - Classic Rock" has been booming out of the 4 speakers on the highway so far.

Apart from the engine note of this car there is another similarity between the Escort and my Mothers Mazda - that is the "Tardis" like quality (Dr Who fans know what I am talking about!) of the car. 
The car looks very compact from the outside but the interior seems to be far larger than you would imagine once you get inside. The trunk is also very big for this "perceived" size of car too.

The car has only been on the road this week and it is too early to make any comments regarding the reliability and economy of the car. 

I fully expect the reliability to be excellent having observed the mileages racked up on many Escorts that I have looked at in the past few weeks (many well over 200+K miles!)

I'll update this review as and when anything crops up.
