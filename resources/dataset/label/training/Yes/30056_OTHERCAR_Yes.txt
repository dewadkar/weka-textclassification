            I have owned three digital cameras and have enjoyed all of them, but I must say this Kodak 280 blows all of them out of the water.  I can not begin to express how wonderful this camera is and the quality of photos is outstanding.  I have used the camera in every lighting condition you can think of and never did it fail to produce a good still photo.

The camera comes with a 20MB Compact Flash Memory card, which can store 245 standard or 32 high resolution photos.  Which quite a bit more than most cameras will store. Kodak didn't cheat on features either to give great image quality, it has a 1.8 inch LCD for framing shots, extensive flash features, and comes with great software.

Getting the images into your computer is a dream with the USB hookup system, and the time of getting them into the computer takes only seconds.  If you have ever tried the old way via the parallel port you will really appreciate this USB download system.

The only real weak point is the battery... This camera eats a lot of power but the great photos is a good trade off.  I would suggest two things for this.  One make sure you use rechargeable batteries, and secondly I would advise you to purchase a second rechargeable battery pack.  This will allow you to have more than one with you.  For example on a fully charged battery I was able to get 384 shots before the batteries died.

I would without hesitation recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for great quality, ease of use, and functional.  I still can't begin to rave enough about how much I like this camera.<br><br>
