            I have enjoyed my RX300 for two years now. I was the first on my block to get one! Several reside in the garages on my block after many of my neighbors liked what they saw in my driveway. Even other manufactures liked what they saw in the Lexus and have gone out of their way to copy the aerodynamic design of the RX300. 

When I bought the RX300, I was looking for a luxury car and a truck. I was not sure that I really wanted to get two cars, since I only needed truck functions some of the time. During my search, I found that the RX300 could meet both needs for a reasonable price. The vehicle is well constructed and has given me few problems. She has a great ride and gives the driver great control over the road. The RX 300 drives and rides like a car that is a bit higher up off the ground than say their ES 300.

Aside from a great drive, the driver has full control of all controls from a cockpit set up. It is much like a good aircraft where all the dials are set up close to the pilot for maximum comfort and control. Cruise control is located on the steering wheel, which is also packed with a nice air bag. I have yet to use it but have seen a couple of others that were deployed and they protected the driver from serious injury from contact with the steering wheel. 

The center of the dash is where you will find the other important controls. You will find your climate control as well as one of three automotive electrical appliance plugs (12V of course). The radio as well as CD player controls are located here. You also have a large screed that displays the information about the climate control, radio station or CD, and information about your trip. You can track your time en-route, your gas mileage, your average speed, and your current gas mileage. 

In my car, all of the seats and most of the side panels in the cars are outfitted with soft leather. The colors are coordinated to make a pleasing match of inside and outside colors. The seats are comfortable and if you are sitting in the front during a frigid day simply push a button and your rear will be warmed by the built in seat warmers, which can really make your rear hot. The rear seat passengers are not so lucky, but they do benefit on hot days from the center console air conditioner vents. 

The rear passengers not only have good air-conditioning, they are fortunate enough to have plenty of leg room. They have much more leg-room than is found in most sedans these days. Shoulder and head room are likewise adequate. 

The cargo area is a bit small, but that is not why you buy this car. You are able to fold down the rear seats to add more cargo room. I find that for most items, I am fine using the available cargo room. A stroller will fit as well there as in the trunk of our ES 300. With a cargo cover, which comes with the car, and a backside electrical outlet, this car comes equipped ready to go. 

For the price, I am not sure you can get much more of a car and truck combo that is well built. Not only is the car well built, but the manufacture stands behind the product. They had me leave the car for a replacement part that they felt all of their cars needed for some reason. They even ended up paying me some money in the form of a gift certificate for taking the time to stop by.  Additionally, Lexus dealers pamper their customers, so owning one is a pleasant experience.

Buy one and enjoy! It makes a great SUV for those who really prefer the drive of a car with extra cargo capabilities. This vehicle drives more like a car than any other SUV I have ever driven.
