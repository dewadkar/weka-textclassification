            This is not my father's Impala! This is like no Impala before. My wife &amp; I went to a Chevy dealer to test drive a Malibu. Well if we wanted to buy a Malibu we should have never also test driven an Impala. What a car! It does not look that big from the outside, but inside my 6'5&quot; body has plenty of room. I even have to pull the drivers seat up because there is so much room. All of the controls are right were they should be and they have a good feel to them (not tight, not loose). Many standard features AC, Auto, power windows doors locks, automatic lights. The only fault is that the rear seat does not fold down with the base seating package. The trunk is huge but Home Depot trips would be easier with the fold down seat. The ride is excellent, very firm and on center. Excellent engine &amp; tranny combo (3.8 V6 &amp; traction control, ABS). It rides like a car worth alot more that $20,000. Many professional reviews I read say that the looks or style is ugly. I don't know what they're looking at cause I think the style is great. Classy but a little flash also. Great for the family with the baby seat anchors in back and lotsa safety features. I recommend this car highly. At $20K there is nothing like it on the market. <br><br>
