            I used to work for Mitsubishi Motors as a sales and leasing consultant in California. The car first caught my attention during my first test drive with a client in the car. It was the first time I took the car out on a drive. The first thing I noticed was the stares I got. That felt kind of good, especially since I had been driving a Mercedes and never got that kind of stare. Secondly, I loved how it handled turns. I worked for Mitsubishi for about 2yrs. Before I left the company, I bought a White 94 3000GT from my manager. She sold it to me for her "payoff" so I got a good deal on the car. After that one, I wanted to get the feel for an SL. So I sold the white 94 and bought a grey 1993 SL. Even though it was a year older, it was even more awesome and I never had a single problem with it. (I take care of my cars, oil change, tune up, etc. Nothing big). Once I joined the military, I got a little extra "spending cash". So I decided to go and buy a BRIGHT red 1997 3000GT. That's the one I'm currently driving. I love it even more than my old one. The spoiler is more pronounced on the 1997 as opposed to the earlier years. This is my 3rd 3000GT and when this one is ready to go, I'm going to go buy another one. Maybe a VR-4 this time. If I had $35,000 to spend on any car of my choice, it would be the 3000GT. Yes, for that price, you could buy a low end Lexus, but those of us who drive the 3000GTs, drive it because we love the car and we love the attention, not because it's economical!
