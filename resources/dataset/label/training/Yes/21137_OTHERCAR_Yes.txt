            <b>The story...</b>
My APS camera broke so I decided to go for a digital camera seeing that I'm usually a horrible shot and super lazy about developing film.

I did some research on the cameras, notable the Canon's and the Sony's and eventually chose the Sony F505v for several reasons.

<b>The reasons why I dished out a grand</b>
The camera has great presence.  The lens barrel fits comfortably in your left hand while leaving your right hand to man the shutter and focus.  Also, Sony smartly place a manual focus ring on the barrel for quick focus.  The barrel also holds several common features such as auto/manual switch, white balance, spot metering, and macro.  The flash release switch is also located comfortably on the barrel.

The features are pretty complete for the average user.  The operator can choose preset aperture and shutter speed steps.  Although the increments are not as high resolution as you might expect on an SLR, they serve fine for the average photographer.

This model (like other Sony digicams) can capture full motion video with sound up to 15 secs.  This was definitely a plus and I've used this feature more than I expected.

The color response is simply amazing.  This camera excels in natural light conditions and a person hardly will care about the 2.5 megapixels (advertised as 3.3).  The LCD display and swiveled body is a plus too.  This helps in bright sunlight so you can tilt your screen to stop glare.

This camera allows for filters!!!  This means you can place perhaps a polarizing filter or color filter!  Most cameras do not have the barrel fittings/threads for filters so I found this one a great bonus and helps extend the flexibility of the camera.

The battery is decent.  Surprisingly 60 minutes is a lot of time to shoot.  Just don't keep the camera on all day.  You'll definitely want to invest in a spare battery though.  The info-lithium is very nice since the battery tells you to the minute how much juice it has left.

<b> Now to my gripes... </b>
Not having a viewfinder is a pain in the dark since you can point the camera using the barrel as a pointer, but zooming becomes next to impossible.

The included memory stick is a measly 8 megs.  You can probably take whole 6 pictures of Peppy the racer snail before you have to run in and download the pictures to clear the memory.

The focus mechanism is slow.  I don't recommend someone using the F505V for fast-paced action like sport shots.

No picture buffer.  This means that each photo must be stored before the next one can be taken.  So sequence shots are VERY hard to do.

Media is expensive.  2 bucks a meg for memory stick is awfully pricey.
