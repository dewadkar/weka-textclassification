            As I was contemplating the extra costs to my used vw jetta,I was greeted by a dealer at VW/Mazda, he suggested that I could walk away from the lot with a brand new 1999;Mazda 626 LX; Sedona Red. I was excited to say the least. My first thought was, the existing loan on the Jetta, the trade in value, and the down payment for the Mazda. I recieved enough trade in to pay off the remainder of the loan and for 500.00 down payment I drove off the lot with a brand new car that exceeds what I expected. My monthly payments are quite high at 363.00 a month for the next four years, but it`s worth it, handling is superb, the interior is emmaculate, smooth ride,plenty of room for the children I hope to have soon, maintenance free after 2300 miles, roomy trunk that fit`s my massage table, vision unimpaired, air-conditioning excellent for hot tempurate environment`s like Hawaii`s where I reside, and the security of knowing that if I give someone a ride, it will be like driving in style. Test drive one today and send your epinion to omar. <br><br>
