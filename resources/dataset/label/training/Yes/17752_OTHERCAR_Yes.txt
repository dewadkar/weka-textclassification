                 Why did I buy my Saturn? I simply needed a safe,four door car so I could travel easier with my infant. I needed the convenience of a four door and was impressed with the things I had heard about Saturn cars. When I went to the dealership I wasn't hounded and I got a good trade in on my sporty, non-child friendly vehicle. I decided to go with the SL2 series and I have continued to be satisfied. I have had my car for about 8 months and it's doing great.
     I love lots of things about this car, but the most important one would have to be the safety cage. With a small child you want the best protection you can get in a small car. I feel safe in my Saturn having seen lots of pictures at the dealership of people who walked away from wretched accidents in their Saturns. The daytime lights are nice, too. It offers a very smooth ride and gets great gas mileage (which is good with the ever increasing gas prices). 
     When I drive my Saturn I feel in control and may I mention this word again SAFE. I can't stress that enough. Not only do you get a very nice ride, but you can't relax a little. I think this car is great for people with small families or a single who is looking for a car with a little more room than a two door. Don't buy this car if you are a speed freak. It goes when you need it to, but don't expect to win any races with this one. Overall, it was a great buy and I will definitely buy another Saturn in the future.<br><br>
