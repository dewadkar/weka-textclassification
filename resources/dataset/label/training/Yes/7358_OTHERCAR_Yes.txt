            There is a new Mercedes CL - class, which I am happy to say, reinforces my belief that there is indeed, a God.
At a starting price of UK$70,680, change out of eighty grand wouldn't fill the tank for the journey you will want to take. Believe me the next thing you should buy is a world map, because as soon as you turn on that 5.0 V8. engine, you'll never want to stop driving.

From the outside the front is the most appeasing view of this garganthuan warhorse. Mercedes' now almost trademark twin oval headlamps, give a 'chubby' look to a beautifully contoured bonnet. From the side, well to be honest this was a design that could have been approached a little differently. It looks to me as the boys at Mercedes stretched the designers original plan, giving the rear lights a mean appearance, as well as over emphasing the chrome around the otherwise mediocre windows.
Alloy wheels do justice to the overall look, my own personal choice being the V12's.

Most everything a person could need is standard on the 500, ABS,ABC, ESP, the usual wood forest creeping seductively along door panels,leather upholstery on remarkably, comfortable seats, six airbags, electric seats, mirrors, windows, need I go on?

Both the engines are very, very good. The V8 to my mind seems to strain a little, while the V12 just anhillates taramacadam. Tiptronic gearbox is nice. Effortless driving makes it easier to keep both hands on a solid wheel. The overall ride is very smooth indeed, although I don't advise challenging any major potholes, as the car seems to dip a little too much. Could be the weight of an enormous grille-mounted three pointed star?

I honestly believe I'd be happier in something a little smaller, but it would be a shame to leave such a beauty behind! For those of you who worry about fuel consumption, buy something more juice friendly. Then again if your in the market for one of these,......home James, ad step on it!
