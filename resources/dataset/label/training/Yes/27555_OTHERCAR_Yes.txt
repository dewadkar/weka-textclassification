            Yes! I love my Grand Jeep Cherokee!  Honestly, I bought it because I fell in love with the look of it!  Now that I have had the honor of driving it, I love it even more!  The Jeep handles beautifully in all weather conditions.  This is my first 4 wheel drive and I'll never go back.  The jeep also has a wonderful heater system in the front seats, I would highly recommend that particular feature.   I can't say I know too much about the mechanics of the jeep, but that's what husbands and service centers are for. (Ha Ha)!  The only thing that has been difficult for me is putting gas in it.  With the prices of gasoline rising, it has been a painful chore. 
I would suggest this vehicle for anyone who appreciates a good solid drive and of course, a beautiful ride.<br><br>
