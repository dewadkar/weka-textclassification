            I just bought a 2000 Saturn SL2.  It's the first car I've ever bought and I'm loving it.  
Saturn makes a great car for it's price range.  Why?  Let me count the ways:
1. It feels solid on the road (at speeds, going around corners, over bumps, etc.).  
2. It gets great gas mileage.  I average 33 miles per gallon (some highway, some city driving).
3. It has plastic doors.  When my car was only a month old a friend backed into it.  If it had had metal doors I would have been paying for some body work.  As it is, there was no noticeable damage!
4. It's comfortable.  Nice seats.  The SL2 even has an adjustable lumbar support (not bad for a cheapo car). And from what I've heard from passengers, the back seat is plenty roomy and comfortable.
5. Fold down back seats.  With this feature I can easily put a 10 foot long surfboard IN THE CAR!  It doesn't look possible, but it works.
6. Great in the snow.  I just used it in the snow for the first time and it handles beautifully.


Reasons not to love the Saturn?  
1. When I got it (brand new) the AC didn't work.  But Saturn fixed it for me no problem.
2. The people at the Saturn dealership can get downright annoying trying to &quot;please&quot; the customer.  I keep getting things in the mail asking me if I'm happy.  I'd be happy if you stopped sending me all the junk mail, damnit!

That about sums it up though.  Fun car to drive.  Cheap sticker price.  I paid about 14k for a standard with none of the fixin's.<br><br>
