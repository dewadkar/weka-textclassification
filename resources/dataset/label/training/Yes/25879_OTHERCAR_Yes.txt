            I purchased this car used as the third owner.  Amazingly all the repair slips from the previous owners were still in the glove box.  If either of the previous owners wrote this review they may not be as compassionate towards the old Jeep as I am.  The hits they took in repair bills would make even the most enthusiastic jeep owner curl their toes.  When I bought this Jeep it had 150,000 miles and now three years later has over 183,000.  My repairs include brakes, catalytic converter, muffler, tune up, and carburetor just to pass emission�s.   It has a few things wrong like the power window motor on the drivers side has died, the air conditioning and heat are none existing, but the things that really count still work excellent.  It does not burn a drop of oil between changes.  Starts the first crank even at low freezing temperatures.  It makes the commute to and from work just fine.  When the 4x4 is needed it still shifts on the fly and runs with the best of them.  The 6-cylinder engine has less power then the current 4 cylinders on new jeeps, but gets the job done.  The point to all this is even with a few minor problems it is still testing the endurance of time and miles.  Having owned many chevy's prior�I can�t remember any going much over 130k without major rework on the engine, drive train, steering, etc.  Jeeps are built tough and will last along time if properly maintained and not severely abused.  I would not recommend the 2.8 L V-6 engine if you were looking for power, but would give it high fives for endurance.  <br><br>
