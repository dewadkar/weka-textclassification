            I have a Slate 1999 300M, with all the possible options except the full-size spare. I originally was at the dealership to test drive a Sebring, but the Sebring's V6 was far too wimpy (especially with a $24k sticker!) so I moved up to the 300M. For $5000 more, I got a hell of a lot more car. 

Overall, I love the car. I have a 25-mile commute to work and it's been great for passing, very peppy, and comfortable. The ride is very smooth and you hardly notice bumps in the road. I have driven it on several long road trips (two were 2000+ miles round trip) and it has been roomy, with plenty of room for luggage. I have had it for 15 months and put 24,000 miles on it. I love the look of the 17 inch wheels, and the dash. 

Now for the cons: the rear bumper is flimsy. Someone barely bumped me on the rear driver-side corner and the bumper/fiberglass completely caved in, necessitating a body shop to fix. I have also had to take it to the dealership 3 times to fix the power windows. The passenger side window quit first, then all but the driver's window quit twice. I didn't use the child lock at all, but it was like it was stuck on. Then it started overheating in the traffic - I had to turn off the AC and turn on the heat - and this was when 3 of the windows wouldn't roll down! In the Dallas June heat this was not appreciated. It took the dealership a week to fix, turns out the fan motor was dead. 

I also have several miscellaneous squeaks and noises; some from the speakers - one of them seems to hum or rattle when the music has any bass. This disappoints me as the stereo was one of the things I really loved about it - but if I can hear squeaks when it's on, that kind of puts a damper on the enjoyment. I also wonder if the paint is the best quality - I have some nicks on the front, and within the first few months the paint was chipped down to the metal in several places. I also have a weird electrical problem: the lights are automatic, but sometimes turning the wipers on/off affects the lights. The dash lights will go on or off, and the same with the headlights. It's very odd and the dealership couldn't figure out what was going on.

I'm not slamming this car, but I was disappointed that I had to make so many trips to the dealer when the car was less than a year old. Could be  because it's the first year the car's out, but it still seems a bit much. Maybe I'm cheap, but I expect more out of a $30,000 car.

Update: I traded the car in this month, on a 2001 VW Jetta GLS TDI (diesel). I have a 40+ mile commute each day, so I needed better fuel economy, and besides I was sick of the problems with the 300. Hopefully the VW will be consistent with the usual great German engineering, and will hold up better.
