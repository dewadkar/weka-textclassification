            We bought a used 1990 Dodge Caravan in 1994 after our twins were born and just sold it last year and got a suburban.  We loved the Dodge Caravan, it was never in the shop for anything major only for oil changes and inspections that were regular maintenance.  It was great for hauling twin children and all their baggage when we went anywhere.  I liked the hatchback where I kept my double stroller and there was plenty of room for it back there.  It has it rattles here and there but not enough to really complain about.  Even in new vehicles there are some rattles.  Also could take 3 other people with us in the other seat in back.  I used to babysit and hauled all children in my van everywhere we went.  Everything worked great on it, all electric, a/c, heater &amp; cruise control.  It was a great vehicles for our family. We sold it only because we needed something to pull our travel trailer, otherwise we would have kept it, very reliable.
It had plenty of room for vacation trips, we could even remove the back seat and have more room for our luggage.<br><br>
