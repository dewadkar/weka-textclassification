            Although this section is for the 2000 model Red Label Arnage, my review is still valide. I took delivery of my Arnage R last month,( my second Bentley ). While the Arnage may be overshadowed by to an extent by some other newer ultra luxury cars, such as the Maybach, and Rolls Phantom, the Arnage remains at the top of my list for it's very dignified and destinctive charactor. 

The car is powered by a 6.75 liter twin-turbocharged V8, the same engine that has powered Bentleys'for years, but now with a host of refinements, as well as twin turbos' replacing the single large unit of before, in turn widening the power band and making the delivery more linear. This makes for a very different feel from the single turbo cars which had the boost suddenly "kick in". Single and twin turbo are both very satisfying in their own way in my opinion.

Much of the features and refinement of the Arnage can be found in cars that are a quarter of the price, but the Bentley has such an air of dignified, effortless grace and solid, quality "feel" that just aren't found in cars even in the $100,000 range. The materials are top class, anything that looks like chromed metal is, and the paintwork is superb.

Over the road, the Arnage provides a "meaty" centered feel in the steering, with excellent progressive brakes. Throttle response is relaxed and very smooth, yet very quick, more quick than it feels. Before you know it, the car is running at a very fast clip, but with none of the noise or unsteadiness of some other cars. The Arnage is feels very nimble, and has decent grip, especially for a car weighing around 5,400 lbs. Body roll is not even an issue unless you really man handle it, but why would you? The transmission shifts are not buttery smooth, though not harsh by any means, it doesn't bother me at all.

Interior fittings are top notch, nobs and switches work with effortless fluidity. If that sounds overly poetic, well, riding in this car is almost poetry.

Overall, I'm proud to own this car, and love it's powerful old tech engine. Newer competitors may be even more smooth, but to me, nothing beats this "old school" Bentley. Now that Volkswagen now owns Bentley, this may be the last car like it. I had to get it while it's still around.
