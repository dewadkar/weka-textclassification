            My husband and I recently purchased a 1996 4 wheel drive Ford Explorer XLT.  Initially we wanted an SUV for below $10,000...we found that to be difficult.  We found this '96, and for just under $14,000, with all of the great extras, couldn't pass it up.  Dual air bags, dual pwr. seats, 6 changer cd player, &amp; even an electronic compass and outside temperature gage.  It has it all! It rides very smoothly yet, with the off road sized tires, can still take us for a &quot;ride.&quot;  

Having three young children, we wanted extra seating space and unfortunately, this is the one draw back for us.  Two bucket seats in the front means actually giving up a seat when comparing it to a regular bench seating of a 4 door Sedan. However, our baby can actually &quot;see&quot; out of the car window since it rides much higher than a car.  This helps when a long road trip makes for many hours in the car seat.  I would definitely say that the one draw back for us is made up for in the quality of the ride and the luxuries included in this model of Explorer.<br><br>
