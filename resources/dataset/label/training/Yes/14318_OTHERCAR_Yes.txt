            I just recently purchased a 2003 Nissan SEntra Spec-V.  I love the car.  She has enough torque in the lower rpm range to make starting and stopping a blast!!  The powerband seems to be pretty linear until you hit about 4500 rpm's.  This is where the power and torque seems to fall off a bit straight up unitl the 6300 rpm redline.  The ride is very smooth and quiet.  The seats are comfortable and wrap around your body effectively holding it in place as you rocket around turns.  They are also adjustable 4 different ways.  The standard forward and backward, and putting the back down or up, but then also offers the driver (not passenger) the option of raising or lowering the front of the seat under your thighs and raising and lowering your butt.  The handling is excellent.  The 17" tires, stiffer suspension, and cross member connecting the two front strut towers really gives this car a positive feel through the turns.  Ever hear of glue on your tires?  :)  
There are however, seveal downsides to this car.  First off, there seems to be a reliability issue that I keep hearing about.  I only have 1,300 miles on it so far, so I will write more on that at a later time.  I opted to get the Sentra without the premium sound package and the stock sound system stinks.  I have all of my own equipment that I'm going to replace the stock stuff and I think that this may be the way to go.  Comprable in price to the premium package and sounds better (I test drove one with the sound package).  Problem with not getting the sound package is that you can't get the ABS system and side impact airbags without it.  I was told this by two seperate dealers.  They said that Nissan isn't making the car without both packages.  Also, the car has a pull to the left under heavy acceleration.  THis is due to the helical limited slip differential trying to keep traction.  It is not too bad, but something that you need to get used to.  The clutch is also a bit choppy.  It almost feels like it grinds a bit.  I asked the dealer about this and he said that it's a normal thing for Nissan clutches to do.  
Other than those things, this care is awesome.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Good luck
chris.
