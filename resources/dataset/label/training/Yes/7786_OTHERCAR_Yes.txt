            I really like my Acura TL.  It's a good solid car, with lots of nice features, for a good price.  The inside looks classy, with leather seats, steering wheel, and shift nob.  The engine is powerful and the car accelerates very well.  
The TL is a classy car, I feel like it fits right in if I park next to a BMW or a Mercedes.  It may not have as many little perks as more expensive luxury cars, but I definitely think it's the most high class car in it's price range.  
The TL is also nice because almost everything is included.  At first I looked at several less expensive cars, but by the time I added on features that the TL already had, such as heated leather seats, xenon headlights, and a sunroof, the others cars were just as expensive.  The only option I got on the TL was all season floor mats.  

There are only a few things I don't like about the TL.  One of them is the steering wheel placement.  To me the steering wheel seems too far away from the seat.  If I move up so that I'm a comfortable distance from the wheel, then my legs are cramped.  I'm a woman, and maybe the problem is that my arms aren't as long as a man's but I wear shoes with thick soles the make me push my seat back more.  It may just depend on your proportions.

My one other issue with the TL is that the gas petal is pretty sensitive.  The TL has a lot of horsepower and accelerates very quickly (which is a plus in general).  A little pressure on the gas goes a long way, and it's easy jerk forward a little to quickly from a stop.  I got used to it after awhile, but it bugs me when I switch back from driving a different car.
