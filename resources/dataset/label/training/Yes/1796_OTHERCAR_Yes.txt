            I have purchased many vehicles in my time and have finally decided to go back to the type of car I had in high school.  That one was very dependable even with its age, and I expect nothing less for this one.  I purchased a 1999 Oldsmobile Cutlass GLS.  I have gone from Nissans to Fords and now back to the Olds.  It certainly is no longer your father's car.  It has a sporty look with the luxury feel.  Leather interior, CD player, sun roof, and much much more make this the best buy for a dependable vehicle.  If you are looking for over priced, bad performing, high maitenience.. then the Olds Cutlass is not the car you are looking for.  If you are looking for a well priced, outstanding performance, and low, low maitenience...(except for the regular warranty services required) then the Olds is exactly the car you are looking for. <br><br>
