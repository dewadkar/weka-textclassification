            Wow it's great to hear that some people are still interested in the old rotary engine sports cars. I first brought a Mazda RX-7 home when I was 16, I picked it up for 500$ and after a motor rebuild it was great. The handling and acceleration were amazing; it truly felt like an expensive sports car. But for a mere 800$ I didn't expect my Rex to last me too long...so I sold it for 1000$ and bought a 1986 RX-7 GX for 4500$. In terms of condition this one was much better, but it still handled and accelerated just as effortlessly as my previous one. I love it! I bought the car from the original owner who recently had a baby and needed the extra seating room. Yes unfortunately it is only a 2 seater, but as far as I'm concerned that adds a lot to the authentic sports car look and feel.
   The car really is designed well; all the important buttons on the dash are within a fingers reach and very straightforward. I really get a lot of attention driving around in this car, with the pop-up headlights and the dual exhaust purring from the 13b rotary "powerhouse" of an engine under the hood. Bucket seats comfort your back and head and in the GXL version you find options like leather, air conditioning, Bose CD stereo. My first RX-7 was an 87 and it was unfortunately automatic, the 86 I'm currently driving is a standard. But the automatics shift soooo smooth and the standards have a beautiful short and fast shifter...I'd be happy driving either.
   I've had my 86 for 2 years now but need to sell if after winter for a more practical car, seeing as I am getting married in the summer. These cars are nothing but 100% fun, and even the winter driving can be a blast...to anyone looking to park one of these sporty hatchbacks in their garage make sure to go out and take one for a drive. I can guarantee you'll want one.
Thanks for reading and good luck!
