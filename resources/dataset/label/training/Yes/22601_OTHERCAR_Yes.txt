            I bought my GTi VR6 brand new in 1998 and let me tell you, this thing is GREAT to drive!  It has all the amenities one would expect from a luxury car, including leather seats, power windows, locks, remote entry, power sunroof, valet key that doesn't unlock the trunk or inside compartments, and an engine that absolutely screams when compared to any other hatchback in this world!

The driving experience in this car is wonderful!  It comes with a standard 8-speaker stereo system (I put in a CD player), it handles great on the straightaway as well as while taking sharp turns at high speeds.  The traction control and anti-lock brakes have bailed me out more than once while driving in icy conditions.

Things I wish this car had:  rear seats that lock, preventing valet entrance into the trunk from inside, seat heaters (leather gets cold in below-freezing weather!), side-view mirror heaters, locking gas door, and a cup holder that would hold anything larger than a single can of soda!
