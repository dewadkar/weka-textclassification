            The major SUV boom of the 90's was in the later years of the decade. For some reason, people decided bigger, stronger cars fulfilled them in a way regular cars couldn't. Realizing the public's feelings towards SUV's, car companies began to furiously design bigger and better automobiles. Being in a rather large family I have been treated to rides in many different kinds of SUV's but I can honestly say that the Dodge Durango outperforms every other mid sized/priced SUV for sale. 

The Durango manages to maintain a very roomy interior while still supporting a back third row which can seat another two people comfortably. Every seat in the car in confortable and has more then enough room which makes long trips easier to handle. Durango's have a surprisingly gentle and smooth ride which is a definite plus. Our Durango came with Infiniti speakers and radio controls located on the steering wheel. One con about Durango's is their poor gas milage when comparing them to a smaller regular sized car, but compared to other SUV's the Durango's average of 17 miles to the gallon is far superior. For $29,000 the car might seem a little too pricey for some, but for the others who can pay for it - I suggest you choose the Durango as the SUV of your family.
