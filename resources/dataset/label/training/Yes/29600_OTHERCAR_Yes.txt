            I purchased my 1995 Miata as a used vehicle in August 1998 with 32,000 miles. It now has 79,000 miles. It has been virtually trouble free save the following:

- Rear window cracked and was replaced.
- Zipper for rear window wore out.
- Dash board piece over steering wheel came loose.
- Leather seats are hot and not well suited to convertibles in Hawaii.
- Rear antenna got smacked by a gate at a parking garage. Automatic antenna replaced with a stationary antenna.
- Radiator hose came off and caused car to become inoperable.
- Boot for covering the convertible top is difficult to put on and take off.
- Dents easily.
- No Low on Gas indicator light.

Other than these reasonably small things... I am very pleased with this car. I have had one situation where we broke down and it was a radiator hose.

All things considered I would buy another Miata. I have been pretty hard on it and it still survives. My only complaint is that after only 5 years I have to replace the top.
