            WOW, thats all I can say about this car.  Every thing about it is just awesome. I have been nothing but happy cruising around in the 1998 Lincoln Continental. This car has one of the smoothest rides i have ever felt and for you guys that want speed, this car has that too.  Amazing acceleration is one of the many surprises you will find in this car.  The soft leather seats are something to dream about in all other cars.  Oh yeah, and the heated front seats are always a plus on those freezing winter days.  If you like music you will also love the sterio system.  This car comes loaded with a cd/tape player, 6 disc CD changer, JBL speakers all the way around, and a 8&quot; subwoofer for extra depth to you music.  I know i can't convince you to go out and buy the car but I can tell you why i guarante that you will fall in love with this car, I sure did.<br><br>
