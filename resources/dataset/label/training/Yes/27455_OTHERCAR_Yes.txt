            Are you a person who drives to work or school by yourself?  Are you slightly strapped for cash?  The solution to your problem is the '95 Dodge Neon.  I have had mine since the moment it was released in '94.  The neon is designed wonderfully.  The four door version is big enough to comfortably fit 4...5's a bit of a squeeze in the back though.  This car is essentially problem free.  I have experience no mechanical problems with it.  It is also a very safe car.  There are no blind spots in this car.  There is one design flaw in the car...if you are over six feet you may be uncomfortable driving it.  Your knees will be very close to the dashboard.  Surprisingly, there a plenty of room for everyone else in the car.  This car has great acceleration...if you are by yourself.  If there is more than 1 person in the car you can feel it pushing harder.  Finally the size of this car allows you to utilize the compact spaces.  For the price, the neon is an excellent commuter car.
