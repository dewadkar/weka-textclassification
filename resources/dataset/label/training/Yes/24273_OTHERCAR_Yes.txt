            We purchased our 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee (not a 4 wheel drive) 1 1/2 years ago. We chose this Jeep for several reasons - the main one being the feedback we had received from several friends who also own Jeeps.

We were looking for a 4 door family vehicle, that would seat 3 people in the back comfortably, and have plenty of leg room both in the front and the back. My husband is well over 6 feet tall, so leg room was very important to us. The seats in this vehicle are very comfortable, covered in a velour, cloth type material. The padding on the seat and the back is very soft, but yet provide plenty of support. The front seats are bucket seats and are easily adjusted using some electrical type levers located on the side of the seat by the door. The back seat is a bench seat, with half of it flipping down when needed.

The price of our used Jeep Grand Cherokee was great (13,000) and it was simply beautiful. Both the interior &amp; exterior were in near mint condition, it really looked like the previous owners had taken great care of this vehicle. The mileage when we bought it was still relatively low compared to some of the other vehicles we had been looking at.

Our Jeep handles very well on the highway &amp; in the city. We did not hear any kind of strange noises when going around curves, or coming to a stop. This vehicle is very spacious inside, easily seats 5 adults and has lots of room in the cargo area for animals, sports equipment, groceries etc. It has a spare tire in the cargo area, which does take up a bit of space, but there is still alot of room left over.

One of the things we don't like about this vehicle is that we have had some problems with the brakes and rotors, luckily we learned recently that Chrysler Corporation recalled this model because of problems with the front brake shoes causing excess wear on the rotors. We also are not crazy about the remote lock/unlock feature. You have to be really careful that if you use the remote lock that you also use the remote unlock when you attempt to get back in the vehicle, otherwise the alarm will sound. The alarm seems to be very sensitive to loud vehicles when set, as it has gone off frequently while we went inside the grocery store, etc - several times it went off &amp; we hadn't used the remote lock! 

We have driven this vehicle during 2 winters so far &amp; it has handled well in the snow even though it is not a 4 wheel drive. I have never had any problems slipping, sliding or coming to a stop in the snow or the ice.

Our Jeep Grand Cherokee came with an Infinity CD Player/Stereo System, which includes 6 speakers, and an amplifier. The sound quality is terrific!! This was a definite added bonus that came with our purchase! 

The Jeep Grand Cherokee also has an overhead display system which shows the current outside temperature (though I find this to be off by several degrees), the direction in which you are traveling, miles left before you need to refuel, current miles per gallon, and trip odometer. This vehicle also has a display near the CD player which indicates the current time, whether or not a door is open, any lights that are not functioning, and the miles left to your next service call.

We recommend the Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo to anyone in the market to purchase a family vehicle. Our Jeep has proven to be very reliable, and we will definitely purchase another!
