            I first received a Chevy Silverado for my birthday.  I must say that it's been the gift that keeps on giving.  With a powerful V8, a lowered suspension, tons of features, my friends have stood in awe when I drive by.  At an affordable clearance price (approx $20k) with the &quot;Unique Conversions package&quot;, mine has a cheery wood interior, extended cab, dual exhaust pipes, power steering, and other convenient features, this has become a favorite.  It accelerates quickly, has VERY responsive brakes, dual air-bags with a passanger on/off option, 6 speakers, tinted windows, CD player, mood lights, comfortable seating, and rugged equipment able to withstand the freezing winters or the broiling summer heat.<br><br>
