            I decided to get another camera after owning a Mitsubishi DJ-1000, which featured 240x320 resolution, and an inaccurate viewfinder (did I mention no flash).  I recently graduated, and my parents told me they would give me $300 towards something I wanted, so I decided on another digital camera. I wanted one  that has good enough picture quality to print out photo quality 4x6's.  Not only does this camera do that, it can produce photo quality 8x10's.    It has 6 different levels of compression (2 resolutions, and 3 levels of quality per resolution).  I found that the lowest resolution take up less hard drive space than my old cameras' picture did, yet the DC280's are still more than twice the resolution.  I can store 255 pictures on my 20mb flash card in the lowest resolution.  

As for the features, I will just list them:

Good things:
-comes with long lasting rechargeable batteryies (and charger)
-has 10 second timer
-has optional date stamp (so you can keep track of when you took your pictures)
-has 1.8 LCD viewfinder, as well as a real viewfinder.
-2x optical, 3x digital zoom
-includes cable that lets you view your pictures on your TV
-Allows you to delete pictures(via LCD screen), without having to uplink with your computer
-has close up mode and panoramic mode
-has different flash modes so you can remove red-eye, etc.
-comes with 8mb flash card, or 20mb (depending on which package you get)
-without LCD screen on, it can be on for more than 3 hours, and take at least 50 pictures (I have)

Bad things:
-Doesn't come with any kind of case (they are sold separately for $12+)
-With the LCD screen on, it eats all 4 AA's in about 45 minutes time
-Included software doesn't do much of anything
-Doesn't allow you to take short videos

If you need a camera, get this one (or any of Kodak's other late model DC series).  I have read many reviews on CNET and megapixel.net about digital cameras, and Kodak digital cameras are always rated as having good picture quality and ease of use.
