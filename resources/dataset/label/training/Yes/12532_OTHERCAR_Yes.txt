            Let me start with the fact that I am not a photography geek but just some one who wants a camera for the occasional picture. My last camera was a Minolta 35mm auto point and shoot.

Staples had this camera before Christmas for $199 and they threw in a 64MB SD card and photo kit. This is my first digital camera as I have been waiting for the 3 megapixel cameras to drop below $200. You can take it out of the box, slap some batteries in and start shooting as everthing is in automatic mode when you power it up. Keep extra batteries handy as you will need them. I have been playing with this camera for a month and I am very pleased with the it.

I take all my photos on the highest quality setting as the software will let you reduce it later but you can never add the quality back. The 64MB SD card lets me take about 39 pictures. I say about 39 as the top LCD screen and back TFT LCD screen both show which photo number you are on but the camera seems to use more memory at times and you might not get all 39 photos. 


The digital zoom is useless and I would not waste too much time on it. The physical zoom is helpful but limmited. I most often have to lighten up the photos, especially the indoor shots. The movie feature is great for short clips. You can even add sound clips to your pictures by holding down the shutter button. I have had been transfering my photos onto my PDA so not to have to run home to clear the SD card for more pictures. I have a Dell Axim X2 which has SD and CF slots.

The 735 tries to use the flash all the time which will suck the batteries dead in less than a dozen shots. I have been using NiMH rechargables which should save me a lot of $$$$.
Eveready has some 2100 mAH ones (not the 1800 mAH) which are great, Wal-Mart has em 4 a good price.

 My biggest complaint is the shutter lag, you see a shot and turn the camera on which takes two to three seconds, you point and push the shutter button and............ CRAP!! The shot is gone. 

My best photos have been outdoor shots in good lighting.My inside flash shots are OK but usually need some touch up on the PC later, ie..contrast and brightness.


What I like is this camera uses AA batteries and SD cards for memory. The body is sturdy and the weight just right. The camera is easy to use and has enough features to keep me happy for a while. The software that comes with it is pretty basic for photo editing but will let you sort and upload and print very nicely. The photos are as good as any I have taken with a 35mm film camera.
