            I bought my Sunfire in the spring of '96. It was a fairly new car to the automobile world.  I was shopping with my roommate who was the one looking for a car.  I was the one who ended up buying it.  I was also looking at a Saturn SC1.  I made the right choice.

I was so excited!  I loved this car.  We took it to the place we worked (a department store) and showed all of our friends.  I remember two days after I got it, I was racing to work because I was late (no surprise to those that know me).  I pulled into the parking lot, parked, reached for my diet coke out of one of favorite features - the cup holders! - and there it went, all over the passenger seat.  I cried and cried... all the way home to change my pants, as it had gotten on me as well.  

My Sunfire treated me well.  It never gave me any major problems, was never in the shop for more than an oil change.  There were a couple minor recalls, one for the hazard lights and one for the interior light.  Other than that, there were no issues with performance or maintenance.

The front is roomy enough that you aren't cramped.  The back seat is small, but there is adequate leg room.  The trunk is large enough for lots or groceries or lots of suitcases.

We recently purchased a new vehicle, a '97 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  The Sunfire was not meant to be a family car.  It is not easy to get a baby in and out.  I even ruined a pair of pants trying to get my daughter out of her seat once.  I snagged them on the latch that leans the seat forward.  It was a good thing that happened at home, because I carried my daughter in the house with my hiney exposed!  

I just sold the Sunfire to a friend at work yesterday.  Delivery is taking place at the end of next week.  My husband asked me if I was sad about selling the Sunfire, and I am.  It carries a LOT of memories for me.  I definitely recommend this to anyone.  It's perfect for a single guy or gal who wants something semi-sporty to jet around in.  It's not the perfect car if you are starting a family.<br><br>
