            I bought my black with tan interior 90 Jeep Wrangler ten yars ago because it was beautiful and small car.It was very fun and I thought have it all my life, but I had a lot of problems, and I sold it the last year. The last year I bought a Jeep Wrangler 4.0. 

I went to dealer four or five times per year for diferents reasons: I repaired the start engine eight times and the gearbox two times in 100.000 kilometres. Sure, You have problems with the gas gauge too.Five friend had 1990 and 1991 Jeep Wrangler and they had these problems too.

I had hard top with full doors, soft top with half doors and bikini top. I dont recomend the soft top because you will have headache in a long trip and you wont hear your radio. With the hard top and bikini top in summertime you trips will be more comfortable.

This car has a very good stability on road and it is very handling. When you are going to off road with other SUV, you will be happy seeing as they stop when there is a dificult situation, and you can continious because the Jeep Wrangler is the best in off road<br><br>
