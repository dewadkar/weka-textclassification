            I would recommend this camera.

It has a 2.5" screen/viewfinder used to "frame up" your picture, and make setting changes.  To select settings, you simply use the four way button to arrow over and up and down to your choice. 

The feature I really like is the auto focus.  It does this very well and "adjusts" for you wiggling around.  Out of the hundreds of pictures I have taken, I have only had one picture come out blurry. When I saw the bad picture, I simply deleted it and took a better one in its place!

Don't wait to get home to see your pics.  This has a slide show mode where you can flip through the pics and instantly see what you got.  

This is an excellent camera for the average user.  It is easy to learn for novices.  I should know, because I borrowed it from my neighbor, learned to use it easily, and eventually bought it from him.

You could get the newest model Mavica, but why spend the money?  This one offers eveything you need.  

I only wish the price was a bit less
