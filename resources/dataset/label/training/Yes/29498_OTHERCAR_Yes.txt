            I had been admiring pictures that my cousin had taken with her digital camera and printed on her own printer and I had to have that camera.  It was a Kodak DC240.  To be honest, I didn't have to compare other cameras because the quality was unbelievable, but I did anyway.  And I must say that in comparison to more expensive cameras, such as the Sony Mavica, this camera blew them all away as far as picture quality and ease of use is concerned.  And the price difference between the Sony and this Kodak is nearly $250-300.  

<b>GREAT FEATURES</b>:
This camera is a steal.  The excellent features that I use most are of course the auto-zoom, the timer is terrific since I like to be in the pictures too, the black and white effect is fun to use to create dramatic pictures and the fact that the camera connects directly to your pc via USB cable is one of the greatest features!  And guess what?  The batteries are rechargable!  It really has it all! I was sure I did not want a camera with a disk because it is more time consuming and just a pain.  I can directly view my pictures with one click and edit them in literally hundreds of different ways with the software that comes with the camera, Adobe PhotoDeluxe.  

<b>SERIOUS SOFTWARE</b>:
Seriously, the software is amazing!  You can eliminate red eye, air-brush out a blemish, create tons of things with your images and so much more.  I didn't know much about digital cameras 6 months ago, but because this camera and software are so easy to master, I have fallen into a creative madness!  I just created a photo montage for my mother-in-law's 50th birthday using Adobe PhotoDeluxe.  It was a huge hit, people are still complimenting me on my amazing skills.  But really, with the right software, it's no big deal.  It was actually fun!
