            At the height of the build-up talk of the Gulf (har-har) II War, expecting fuel prices to go thru the roof for who knew how long, I thoroughly did my homework to find the most fuel-efficient, versatile, comfortable & affordable car available.  I decided on the VW Golf TDI as my number one choice.  I then spent countless hours on the internet searching for a 'slightly used' one & ended up having to travel 100 miles to get my Golf, deciding on a left-over new 2002 as the best deal available.  Five months later, even though fuel prices have come back down, I wouldn't trade this car for ANYTHING!

Quality is top-notch.  From the solid thud of the doors to the smoothly working electronic features to the stick-to-the-road handling, you'd think the car was 2 feet longer and wider with twice the engine power and expense.  Yet watch the expressions of drivers of SUV tubs as you zip in & out of parking spaces & passing lanes and load up about 200 lbs of stuff in the hatchback trunk area.  I've passed vehicles which were behind tractor trailers which were behind dump trucks in short passing zones with no 'gulps' whatsoever.  "T" stands for "Turbo!"  Fuel efficiency is always a steady 45 mpg with my cross-country commute no matter the load I'm carrying, traffic situation or driving pattern - getting 50 mpg easily with steady highway travel. 

I've had NO problems whatsoever with the car. VW is realistic in their required oil changes (every 5000 miles, not 3000, even skipping one or two, while being a little pricey with the synthetic oil "needed" with a diesel).  But you don't have to use VW just a "qualified mechanic."  My dealer was most decent & fair & even -gasp- a pleasure to deal with (alas, such as that was with the scarcity of the TDIs).  

The 'cuteness' of the car are numerous joys to discover for yourself (what would one call that exact shade of dash light: periwinkle or lavender?)  The only drawback I can think of (other than the fact they don't make enough TDIs) is the velour-like material of the seats which attract EVERYTHING but good-looking men & money!
