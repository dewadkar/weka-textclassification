            I love driving my Jeep, I bought it for safety and reliability. 

I can see where I am going!, no longer trapped behind an SUV in a sports car as well as having enough room for my dogs.  My Jeep has a Straight Six and Full Power. The interior is gray leather and the exterior white which is great if you cant always make it to the car wash on a weekly basis, as white tends to hide the dirt.  

Jeeps handle great, are known for their superior Air conditioning - so if you tend to be a hotty than you'll like the a/c in Jeeps. The gas mileage is good and its is a great vehicle to drive. It is an SUV so it drives differently than my former sports car, just a matter of taking those turns at slightly less speed which is probably safer all around.  

If you have kids and or pets, the back seat folds down and for more room.  With kids?  I feel the Jeep is safer than most cars, and other SUV's just a sense of well being while in the drivers seat!

Probably not the ideal vehicle for that little old lady from Pasadena but otherwise a good match even if you dont have kids or pets but shop the flea markets, tend to move/change residence often or just want to feel a little bit more protected while out there on the road. Yes, even if you are just driving it to supermarket a mile down the road - you deserve a Jeep.<br><br>
