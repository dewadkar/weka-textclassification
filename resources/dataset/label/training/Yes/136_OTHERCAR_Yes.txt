            I recently purchased the Fujimx1200 digital camera because I was hoping to get the quality of pictures I wanted without getting a lot of unwanted photos which can happen with a traditional camera.  The quality of the photos is excellent (not quite traditional photo quality but very close).  For a relatively inexpensive digital camera around $300 it is easy to use. 
      The negative points about it are that it only comes with a 4mb smart media card which allows very few pictures to be stored on it especially if you choose the finest quality (you need to), so you will need to purchase more smart disks.  A 16mb smartmedia card is probably reasonable. Without a good quality photo printer (with layering technology) the photos will be a disappointment.  I purchased the Hewlett packard p1000 for about $400.  This is a great printer (about the best I have seen).  Since the camera does not come with a USB connection, buying this printer is a way to get around having to purchase one.  Without purchasing one, the transfer of images to the computer is very very slow.  Batteries for the camera are another issue - it uses a lot of &quot;AA&quot; batteries so rechargeable batteries are a good idea. All in all, for the price I am very pleased with my purchase.  Keep in mind the printer cartridges for the HP p1000 are about $35 and if you print a lot of pictures, you can go through one fairly rapidly. The printer also needs to be professionally cleaned every 6 monthes.  So, digital cameras are not a cheap alternative to regular cameras.  In my estimation, per picture cost is probably the same, but since you see what you are saving before printing it and can edit it, you end up printing only pictures that you really want.  Smaller pictures look clearest with 8 by 10's a little grainy appearing.
