            The Chrylser Town and Country Limited represents the ultimate luxury minivan. There are few options, mainly paint and trailering options. The Limited version sports leather seating for all seven locations, Heated power driver and passenger seats, Heated outside rearview mirrors, An overhead console that reads direction, temperature, average/instant mpg, distance to empty, etc. The driver seats and the outside mirrors have memory that is tied to your key fob. It will remember the setting for two drivers. The rear-view mirrors automatically dim with headlight glare.
There are few luxury accesories that are missed here.

Driving the T&amp;C Limited is a joy. It is quiet, smooth and responsive. You can change radio or CD tracks as well as the volume with the steering wheel mounted controls.( The Infinity 10 speaker CD-Cassette- AM-FM system is one of the best I have heard) You can also control the rear heat and air at the dash, or relinquish control to the rear passengers.

All seating positions enjoy reclining seat-backs. The T&amp;C Limited comes with the quad seating arrangement, and the rear bench is custom to the Limited only, having a center arm rest, that can be folded back into the seat for the seventh passenger.

Even loaded, the T&amp;C is a joy. The rear suspension has a marvelous self-leveling system, so even with the entire soccor team, the van sits poised and level.

I cannot say enough about our Pearlescent White Limited. While it is expensive at $36,000.00, it offers unbelievable utility, comfort and room. I would not trade it for anything. ( Except a red 300M.... but that's another story!)<br><br>
