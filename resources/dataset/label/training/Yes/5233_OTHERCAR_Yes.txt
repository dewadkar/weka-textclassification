            When my mechanic informed me that my handed down '87 Toyota Tercel finally was dead, I was thrilled!  Just before my 21st birthday, I was so happy I'd finally be able to get a new and reliable car! I knew that I needed a new car with a good price, and fast (for work, an internship, and school!)  I also knew that I had $7000 to put down, and that I wanted something sporty, cute and unique, not the typical choice of young car buyers on a budget, the Neon. I loath typical stuff like that!  So I visited Dan Georger Mitsubishi.  I knew that I wouldn't be able to afford my fantasy dream car, the Eclipse or the 3000 GT! Too high of payments, and sky high insurance rates!  So I took a four door Mirage for a test drive, though I was looking for a 2 door sporty model.  I just needed something to get a feel for the car!  When my salesman handed me the brochure on the Mirage, I noted that there was a 2 door LS Coupe Model that was loaded!  I wanted that car!  There weren't any of them at all on the lot!  So my salesman went the extra mile to find me the car at another dealer! After all he got buisness from my mom when she bought a Galant!  He managed to located 2 at the Syracuse Mitsubishi!  Once was Royal Blue Pearl, the other a silver color.  I picked the Royal Blue Pearl  1999 Mitsubishi Mirage LS Coupe, and signed for it that weekend last April '99.  The grand total for this loaded vehicle was around 17,000 or so after a 1500 dollar rebate.  I bought the car based on the picture!!  I'll never forget the day I picked up my very first brand new car.  It was loaded, beautiful, and had shiny aluminum alloy wheels, right out of the Syracuse NY showroom, and it was mine!!! It was the most reasonable and wise purchase I ever made!!! <br><br>
