            I have been working on cars (all makes and models) for about five years going on six... I have recently bought a Mazda 626 and i think it a great car... i had problems with it...but they were all fixable and very cheap to fix...especially with the auto intelligence, and to tell the truth mazda probably has the most simple engine setup to work with. 
 It is easier to work on than any honda or acura i have ever owned... 
The point is any car will run GOOD if it is treated right and serviced...
this car gives great gas mileage... it is quiet... it has great performance.... it looks good... and i think that if owners of this car think they are low quality vehicles its because of the knowledge they lack about cars and why their car runs why it runs.... I recommend this car to anyone who knows how to take care of a car not just cosmetically....<br><br>
