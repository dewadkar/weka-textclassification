            Just bought a 2001 Accord LX after waiting years for an old Toyota to die.  It never did so pawned it to my son.  As a long-time car buff, car show attendee, avid reader and test driver, had been working my way towards an Accord for years.  Took the plunge last week, got one and am still trying to get used to it.
Got the 4 cyclinder automatic which is commendably powerful and a super smooth power train.  The car exudes quality in all details.  Fit and finish are superb as are the quality of materials and workmanship.  The cabin is very spacious and provides outstanding outward visibility and  legible/logical/intuitive dash displays.  The doors close with a vault-like solidity.  All features work smoothly and unobtrusively.  Nice sound system.  The car is wonderful except for 2 details which are driving me crazy.  The driver's seat provides 2 small rotary knobs for minor height adjustments that don't really help. I'm 5'9&quot; and usually feel that though the seat is at its lowest height adjustment at both the front and rear of the seat cushion, it still places the driver too high for a comfortable fit beneath the steering wheel- a great view outdoors but uncomfortably close to the wheel.  Though the tilt wheel is set at the upper most position, my legs (average size) barely fit beneath it.  The bigger complaint is with the hardness of the seat cushion.  I hadn't noticed this while salivating in the showroom or while taking the 15 minute test drive.  Anything more than 15 minutes and you'll be squirming and wistfully pondering the thought that you'll probably still be driving this car 15 years from now.  DO NOT OVERESTIMATE YOUR ABILITY TO &quot;LEARN TO LIKE IT!&quot;  The hard-ass seat, combined with the overly firm (though excellent handling) suspension, constantly reminds that &quot;we're not there yet&quot; and &quot;there&quot; can't come any too soon.
In summary, while I love 90% of this car, it's hard not to frequently second-guess the level of satisfaction I might have found with a Camry.  True, the Camry provides less sportiness, poorer visibility, less power and a bit more dated interior, the quality is equal to the Accord, the reliability should at least equal it while providing a smoother, more comfortable ride and interior accomodation.  All things considered, would probably have been happier with a Camry.<br><br>
