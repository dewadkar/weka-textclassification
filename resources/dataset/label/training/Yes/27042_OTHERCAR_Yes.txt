            The Olympus D450 Zoom camera is a great camera for the novice who wants a simple point and shoot camera.  But it can do a lot more, if you want to spend the time learning how to operate its many features.  One drawback is that these features are not intuitive, but they are there if you need them.  For most people, the optical zoom is the most frequently used option.  It also has red eye reduction, panorama mode, exposure control, and many other features.  There are four capture modes (SQ, HQ, SHQ, and uncompressed).  SHQ mode printed on a glossy paper on a good inkjet printer is almost indistinguishable from a film photo.  Battery life is good.  If you don't use the LCD screen and download photos without using the the camera's batteries (such as with a film reader), you could probably take hundreds of picture before changing batteries.  Some other good features are.  The flash is very bright...in fact, it's too bright at close range.  Other good features: lense cover, rapid shoot mode (speed varies on image capture quality), versatile flash modes, very good LCD screen.  Overall, a very good camera.  Of note, if you get this camera you may at first be willing to put up with the slow serial connection for downloading films.  But trust me...after a while you will want to opt for an accessory which will make downloading easier, quicker, and spare your batteries, like a film reader or floppy adapter.<br><br>
