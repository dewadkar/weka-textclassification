            About two years ago I bought a used 1997 Toyota Camry. I have been very pleased with the car since the day I bought it. It was a lease-return vehicle with 16,000 miles on it when I bought it. Now it has about 40,000 miles and has been totally trouble free. 

Its exterior design is somewhere between conservative and sporty. I�ve heard some call the design boring, but it suits me fine. I think its one of the best looking 4-door mid-sized sedans around.

There are two engine choices for the 1997 Camry: 4 or 6 cylinders. I have the 4-cylinder model. The engine is just a little bit underpowered for acceleration from a standing start. However once you get going, the acceleration is ample and the ride is quite smooth. My previous car was a big V8 station wagon. Having become accustomed to it, I was pleasantly surprised at the quiet and smooth power delivered by a 4-cylinder engine at speeds over 70 mph. A Camry with a 4-cylinder engine is considerably less expensive than a 6-cylinder model. Unless you really have a need for the extra power, go with the 4-cylinder since it will live up to the needs of most people.

The gas mileage is good. In stop and go traffic I get about 24 mpg, and on the highway I get about 30 mpg.
The owner�s manual indicates that the car has a gas tank with a capacity of 18.5 gallons. Based on how much gas I have put in to fill it up when it was near empty, I think the actual number is somewhat less than 18.5 gallons.

The interior is quite nice. Front and rear seats are comfortable even for long drives. The drivers seat could stand to go back about two more inches, but that�s my personal preference. The bottom line is that there is enough room for all but very tall drivers. I wouldn�t have bought the car if I couldn�t comfortably fit behind the steering wheel. 

The stereo is Toyota�s basic AM/FM cassette sound system. It�s totally adequate for me and anyone else who don�t insist on top quality (and expensive) sound. One feature that I do like about the sound system is the antenna; it�s built into the rear windshield, so you don�t have to worry about it being broken off in a car wash.

The air conditioning is good, but works better at highway speeds compared to stop and go traffic. That�s to be expected in a car with a 4-cylinder engine. 

I found that the head rests for the rear seats obstructed my view out the rear window just a bit too much, so I removed them. 

The 1998, 1999, and 2000 models are similar to the 1997 model except for some minor changes, but the engine choices are the same.

There are three trim levels of the Camry: CE, LE, and XLE. The CE is the most basic version with few extras. The LE is the version that I have. It has power everything (except seats) and enough features to make most people satisfied. The XLE is the version with all the bells and whistles.
