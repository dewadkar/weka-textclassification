            This car is really nice car. If you ask me this car would be perfect if your the kind of person that likes luxurious and sporty looks. Also, this car is very very fast. You can also buy much more features outside of the Acura dealers such as, bodykits, exhaust,wheels,intakes, and much much more... Most people like this car because of the looks but, I like this car because of the speed it has and also the looks. The only bad thing is that if you has a couple of kids it mite be hard to fit them in because the Acura NSX is mainly made for two people only. Another bad thing is that you get really tempted to speed in this car. Trust me. I have a friend and I have driven his car and it is very fast. You can even feel that you are going 90 mph, thats how smooth the ride is.<br><br>
