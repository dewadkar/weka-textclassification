            222 horsepower from normally-aspirated 3.0 liter V6?? That's what I call amazing. I have driven with this engine, and its great. This year, Nissan has increased the horsepower. Last year the Maxima ONLY had 190 horses. The engine is quiet, and it accelerates very quickly, anywhere. There is a hill in town, which is very steep, maybe a 10% to 15% grade. Most cars go up it at about 25-30 mph, but the Maxima will accelerate to 40-45 mph in six or seven seconds, and the engine stays pretty quiet. 

We can drive around sharp turns at about 50, and the car holds its ground. Granted, it rocks side to side for a few seconds, but it can take the turns at very fast speeds. Riding in this car, I don't understand how Nissan made such a full-bred sports sedan, for such a low-cost. 

The interior is large in the front, and cramped in the back, but with the redesign, the space has increased, and allows larger people to sit back there. All the controls are in easy-to-use places, which I have found is normal for all Nissans. 

ABS is now standard which is a good thing. The ABS I had actually saved my life. There was snow on the ground, and we went into the stop a little to fast, and started to skid, but ended up stopping in no time.

The only obvious problem with this car is the styling. The front looks a little like a Accord, with more rounded edges, but the back has some problems. All Nissans have bad trunk design. It slopes down, giving the car a weird look. Its hard to describe, but I think if the trunk was raised, I think this car would look better. Overall, its fresh and clean, but could be better. 

If you have the money to by this car, do it! You will not regret it. The reliability is great; you won't need a new car for ten years.
