            Well I have been an owner since September and I have not owned a vehicle that I look forward to driving every single day.

The vehicle is spacious , comfortable and so very versatile. The over the top styling ensures you get a lot of looks and people will literally walk across a parking lot in sub zero temperatures to ask you about your vehicle.

The engine is powerfull enough to do everything you want but give me 30 more horses and I would be insane about this vehicle.

All the bells and whistles in this vehicle make you feel like you're in a Lexus at half the price.

Another postive:  Because the vehicle is not selling as well as PONTIAC would like you should be able to drive a great bargain.

If you have any questions at all and would like to talk to a real owner.........Drop me a line at kissfan@raidersfan.net

Great vehicle.......If you buy one you will be happy!!!
