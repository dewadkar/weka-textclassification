            I purchased a 1993 Chevrolet Beretta on September 22nd of 1993.  Then, exactly one month later, I received my driver's license.  In other words, it was my very first car and it was a great car.  Since it was purchased at the end of the year, I got a great deal.  Basically, my Beretta has the GT package, with everything except the dash display items (such as a tac) and no writing on the side.  It came with a V6 3.1L automatic engine, ABS, power everything and the 16&quot; alloy wheels.  

This car handled the inexperience of a new driver and through its responsiveness and sturdiness saved me a lot of headaches.  For the first 3 years, there was very little mileage (less than 15k in total), but when I started college, I put it to the test.  Twice a month I was making a round-trip of approximately 750 miles.  The car was fantastic on long rides from both a comfort stand-point, as well as reliability.  I never felt nervous driving that car

In addition to my commutes from college and back, my regular driving resulted in around 4,000 miles.  After college, I began commuting in the lower New York area.  Right now, my odometer is reading 95,400 and the car is not showing signs of wear.

About 2 years ago, I drove to Rochester, New York (where I went to college) during the blizzard that resulted in 4 feet of snow.  Seeing as how it was early March, I had elected not to purchase snow tires that year and had on a set of 2 year old high performance Yokohamas.  Needless to say, I was alarmed when I saw the snow storm, but the Beretta was flawless.  During the 8 hour drive (which normally took 5), I never once had any trouble.  The design of the car (in that it's low to the ground) allows the driver to feel the road and therefore conciously correct (when necessary) before it's too late.

The only real negative I have found in the past 7 years of owning this car, is the typical GM turning radius.  For such a small car, it would make sense to design a chasis that could turn quickly.  Fortunately, I never found this to be a factor in the day-to-day maneuverability of the vehicle.

I absolutely love my Beretta.  For an inexpensive car, it has provided me with no headaches or troubles.  I recommend this car especially to new drivers because it has the power and the control that lets you have fun, but not so much that it gets you into trouble.  <br><br>
