            When the new body style on the Eclipse's came out I really didn't like them. They were too "futuristic" for me. I liked the old body style better. But as I saw more and more of them on the road I began to adapt to the newer style; so much that I decided to buy one for myself. This is one of those cars that just catches people's attention. I like that in a car. The car has got a lot of punch with its 200HP so it will get up and go without a problem. I opted for the GT version for some of the options that came with it. Besides the backseat and the trunk space being too small, I have no complaints whatsoever about my car. I am in love with the way it runs, the way it looks, and its being a foreign car makes me feel a little safer because I know it will last longer. The sound system is awesome! I can't complain about a 210 watt system that comes standard. Another thing that the GT came with was a Sportronic transmission, so you can drive it in automatic mode or as a manual without the clutch, you just decide when to switch the gears and it does the downshifting for you. It really works for if you want to take off faster. If you are willing to spend 28K on a car, this is a great one to look into.
