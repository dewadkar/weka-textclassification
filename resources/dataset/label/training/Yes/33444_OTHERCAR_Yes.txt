            I had been driving a 1992 Honda Civic and wasn't really in the market for a new car, until I laid eyes on the new VW Jetta.  The styling really caught my eye - thought it was a BMW at first.

I did some research and found the GLS package had all the standard equipment I was looking for.  Power windows/doors/locks, security system, 8 speaker cassette stereo, front/side airbags, full-size spare, height adjustable seats, A/C, pollen/odor filter, among many others.  These things attracted me to the car.  What sold me on it was the driving experience.  When you drive this car, you feel like you're driving a much bigger, heavier car.  You feel safe inside.  You stay upright around sharp turns instead of being thrown from one side to the other.  

One of a couple of drawbacks are the velour seat covers.  They're like a lint magnet and need to be swept with a lint brush more often than I care to.  Buy leather! Another problem is with the 115hp engine, which is a little sluggish when you need a fast start.  

Finally, and this is more of a curiosity, is that the headlights must be very bright at night.  On-coming cars are constantly flashing their headlights at me to tell me to turn my highbeams off, which they are.  I just flash back.  :-)<br><br>
