            We've been through the mini-vans! A 1993 Nissan Quest, 1996 Chrysler Town and Country, a 1999 Honda Odyssey EX and now back to our favorite: 2000 Nissan Quest.  We reluctantly sold our old Nissan Quest when the twins were born and we wanted a minivan with a passenger door on the driver's side. Our other mini-vans were both very trouble-prone.  We are glad return back to the Nissan Quest.

While not as large a van as the Honda Odyssey, it still has plenty of room, drives like a car (not a truck) and has plenty of features for a great price.

We bought the GLE, top of the line model, paid $25,500 which included the sun roof, tow hitch, AM/FM-CASSETTE/6 CD CHANGER, separately opening rear glass door, memory seats, leather, mats, shelf unit for the rear storage area, full size spare, Entertainment system-VCR, pop-down mirror to check on the kids in the back, headlights that go on automatically at dark, and I'm sure there's some features I'm leaving out. The ride is AS comfortable or better than the Odyssey or T&amp;C. Also, Honda recommends PREMIUM gas for the better horsepower while the Nissan has the same pickup as the Honda and uses regular gas (the horsepower of the Nissan is 175 which is less than Honda, but you wouldn't notice a difference).

The ONLY change I would do the Nissan is continue to increase the size of the van to be comparable to the Honda or Town and Country. The van so far has been perfect for our family which consists of mom, dad, a 7yr old and 4 yr old twins.  If there's more kids than that, a larger van might be needed.

We haven't had the van long enough to comment on quality, but based on our last model and based on recommendations from our friends that have the 1999 Quest, reliability has been excellent.
