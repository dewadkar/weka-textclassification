            The Ford Focus is a great deal for a first time buyer.  The Focus handles like a sports car, yet has the room of a larger sedan.   The five speed manual transmission handles smoothly and provides the excitement Indy drivers must feel.  If you would rather have an automatic transmission, this is still a fun car to drive.  For a compact car a lager person has no trouble getting in and out of this car.  There is more headroom than the Escort and better legroom in the back than even the Tarsus.  If you are concerned about the lack of truck space with most small cars donï¿½t be, the Focus has plenty of room for luggage, golf clubs, or whatever your needs may be.  The only concern is the gas mileage is not as good as a Honda Civic, only averaging around 25 miles per gallon.

I have owned a Focus since April and have loved every moment.
