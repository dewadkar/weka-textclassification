            I recently purchased my first car last August. As you can guess it is an Elantra. My new investment has been the best decision I've made this year. The value of the warranty, gas mileage, and durability surpasses other cars in its class. People often inquire about the value and the performance of the vehicle. When I give people rides, I always receive compliments on its spacious back seat and smooth ride. The ample truck space is more than sufficient to haul a card table, four chairs, my brief case, CD player, a bulky comforter and a case of Dear Park water. It is a misconception that a little money will not go a long way. For ten bucks I can go from Southern Delaware to Philadelphia, PA to visit several family members (who live approximately 30 minutes from each other), then go to work (approximately 15 miles one way) for three days! The warranty on the car acts as a security blanket. I have peace knowing that my car will be covered well after it is paid off. I feel safe, secure and delighted that I still have money at the end of the month. I am looking forward to owning this car for five or more years.

Big Bang for your Buck!!<br><br>
