            I bought my 1993 Nissan XE new and it has turned out to be the best car I've ever had.  Previously, I had owned a VW pick-up truck, Fox GL, and Vanagon, (all fair cars) as well as two hideous cars, a Plymouth Duster and a Ford (Death Trap) Pinto.  

My little Sentra just turned 130,000 miles and the only major repairs have been replacing the starter at 100,000 miles and the CV joint boots at 85,000 (and that repair was under the warranty).  All the rest has been normal wear and tear--brake pads, tires, etc. I do believe that this kind of service record has to do with my vigilant maintenance as well as with the quality of the car itself.  Even the nicest car can be ruined with poor care.

It has a 4 cylinder, 1.6 Liter engine which, because it is a stick, provides PLENTY of pick-up and performance.  This might sound strange, but it's true.  I personally dislike automatics (I've only had one) due to the feeling of lag they normally produce.  I feel safe in this car and confident in its handling ability in tight situations.  I used this car during my years in outside sales, putting on over 23,000 miles per year for 4 of the 7 years I've had it.  I worked a lot in the San Fernando Valley where it gets to over 100 degrees every day for about 3 months out of the year, but my Sentra's air conditioner stood firm and COLD.  And, since I drove alone so much, the Nissan issue sound system was and still is much appreciated for its surprising quality.

Now that the miles are a bit high and I would like to get a car with things like automatic windows, sport tuned suspension, power sunroof, alloy wheels, etc., I'm going to trade this car in for . . . 

A new 2000 Sentra SE with the sport package!!  And I think I picked the perfect year, too.  My own experience coupled with the new advances at Nissan and the Sentra has never looked so good.
