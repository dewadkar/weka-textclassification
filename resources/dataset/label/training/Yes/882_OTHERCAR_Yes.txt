            I just got this little camera not too long ago and let me tell you, it is sweet!  I have been looking for a digital camera for the past year and a half.  After doing lots of research and price comparisons, this is the beauty that I chose.  It has great quality and it is a lightweight but it is also expensive.
When it comes to quality, this camera is hard to beat.  It has 3.34 megapixles.  What does that mean to you and me?  It means that you can get some super sharp pictures even if you enlarge them to a full-page size!  Amazing hu?  I tried to see if I could fool some people with it so I took a picture with my SLR camera and this Olympus and set out to see if my friends could tell the difference.  They couldn't tell!!!  Now that is quality.
Not only does this unit pack a quality punch but also it does it at a very lightweight.  The unit weights less then all my other cameras excluding my point and shoot zoom.  I couldn't believe that something so great could be so light!  
I know, I know.  You are asking me, "James, why wouldn't every own one of these?"  The answer is the price.  When I purchased this unit, I checked around to see what the going price was.  What did I find?  Most retail stores like Best Buy had it on sale for $699.  $699?  Not thatï¿½s is a lot of money.  I was able to find a store online using mysimon.com that was selling it brand new with all the normal stuff with it for just over $480 so I dropped the credit card digits and got it.  But even at that price, the unit is a little expensive.  But well worth it.
This is a unit that I think anyone who is serious about buying a great camera that takes great pictures should purchase.  It might be a little expensive, but well worth it!
