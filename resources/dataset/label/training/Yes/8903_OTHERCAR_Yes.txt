            Don't get me wrong, this is a great car.  It is a blast to drive, and it certainly turns heads no matter where I take it.  I didn't get the Roadster model, which is probably my mistake, but this car just all that I expected it to be.  This car looks incredibly fast, but sometimes looks can be deceiving.  I have certainly driven much faster cars.

This is a beautiful car though.  The handling is excellent, and it has a definite touch of sophistication.  It is one of the funner cars to drive that I have ever been in.  Almost everything about this car was nearly perfect, except for the overall speed.  I guess that I should have just gotten the Roadster model.  This car is very quick, and maybe I just had too high expectations, but it doesn't do all that I expected.  

Overall, I would recommend this car to most people, it is a joy to drive, the handling and styling are amazing.  If you are a &quot;speed demon&quot;, then perhaps you should move up to the Roadster model, or get another car.  Other than that, this is a great little car. <br><br>
