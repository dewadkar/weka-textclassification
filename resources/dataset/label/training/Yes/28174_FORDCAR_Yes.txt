            I have owned my Taurus for 3 years and I put about 60,000 miles on it in those 3 years. I have been very happy with the car in all aspects except road noise. The weatherstripping on the windows seems to make a lot of noise. If you play the radio at average volume you don't seem to hear it, but when the radio isn't on, it seems kind of loud. The ride is great, both front and back seats. You can easily sleep in the back seat on road trips. There is plenty of room for the family up front, and the luggage in the trunk! The acceleration is also very good for a &quot;family&quot; car, as you can make passes safely. 

Common repairs are average in cost: brakes,tires,oil changes. But I have priced some other parts that seemed a little high: rotors=$100, alternator=$200, these seem about double what the average part might cost. Fortunately I haven't had to replace these parts, but it is something to keep in mind when buying this type of car.

Overall the 1995 Taurus is a great family with pretty much everything I have expected from this car. If they would fix the road noise it could be almost perfect!<br><br>
