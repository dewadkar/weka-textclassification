            I purchased my '93 used w/ 13K miles in 1995, was initially drawn to its lines but was astounded by the engine.  Rated 278HP from a big V8 got up and moving in a hurry.  I have to admit the LS400 has a better appointed interior...the Q has a nice leather interior, but no wood fascia on dash, minimal whistles and bells, NO CUPHOLDERS (!)...but has a nice round clock.

But compared to the Lexus (its nearest direct competition), the Q drives like a &quot;driver's ride&quot; rather than a Japanese yacht.  Lexus has little or no road feedback (for some, a plus...), no acceleration (at least not in that year).

The Q has phenomenal acceleration for its size, great road feedback...have often found myself at 110MPH without realizing it.

However, &quot;in the interest of science&quot;, I've recently done a few modification to improve performance.  Moving to Tokico shocks has stiffened up the ride, improved cornering and road handling.  Moving to Dunlop SP5000 in 245/45/17 on MAS 17x7.5 wheels and Eibach Pro-Kit springs (wider, low profile tires...stock was 15&quot;, and Pro-Kit drops car 1&quot; in front) makes the car stick to the road as if glued.  Adding Jim Wolf Technology's POP Charger (replaces typical modern labyrinth of plastic air intake boxes with &quot;close to direct&quot; intake induction) has made an incredible increase in acceleration and HP.  

Next month will add JWT ECU (engine control unit) replacement to remove electronic top speed limiter, and add another 25 to 27 HP.  

This is a little ironic for some as my driving record is clean enough for me to be a State Farm &quot;lifetime&quot; customer. 

I'd recommend this car (and these mods) to anyone who wants a performance luxury sedan...emphasis on &quot;Performance&quot;.<br><br>
