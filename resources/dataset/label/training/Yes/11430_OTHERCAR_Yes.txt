            The Toyota 4-runner...it is a beautiful SUV.  I haven't bought one but a friend of mine has one and I love to ride in it.  It feels like home with it's comfortable leather seats.  The sound system is incredible- not too harsh and not too light.  It is altogether a better ride for your money.  Inside it is light and airy and on the outside it is arrogant and bold.  I would have to say that this is the best SUV on the market. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone of any age. It is a dependable car for a teenager, a roomy vehicle for a family, and perfect for someone who likes to travel.<br><br>
