            <i>"Why waste time daydreaming about a more refined drive when you can experience it with the stylish, high-performance Accord Coupe?"</i>-Honda

Wow, I couldn't have said it better myself.  This car, which has been in <i>Car and Driver's</i> "10 Best" list for the past four years gives a whole new meaning to "You really get your money's worth."

This sleek coupe is available in either a 4 cylinder (2.3 liters) or a V-6 (3.0 liter displacement) which is a step up from older models.  It is a front wheel drive and available in manual or automatic transmission.  It features anti-lock braking systems in most and has 15 inch alloy wheels with the option to upgrade to 16 inch alloy or chrome.

Not only is it powerful, there's also enough room in this sporty little coupe for all of your friends!  Headroom ranges from 39.7 to 38.0 inches in the front of the car and 36.5 inches in the rear.  Legroom is from 42.6 inches in the front and 32.4 in the rear.  Go ahead...<b>S T R E C H !</b>  And while your at it, fill up the tank...this baby comes with a 17.1 gallon tank.  So you won't have to fill up as often.  = )

What's your favorite color?  Well, I bet you can find an Accord coupe to match your tastes.  Exterior color options for this car include "Eternal Blue Pearl", "Noble Green Pearl", "Taffeta White", "Satin Silver Metallic", "Nighthawk Black Pearl", "San Marino Red", and "Naples Gold Metallic".  It is also available in cloth or leather seats in ivory or charcoal.

Interior features and options include an immobilizer theft-deterrent system.  This "cuts off" your car and the ability to start it or move it in case of tampering.  Driver's and front passengers air bags are included as well as a power driver's seat.  A few more options are power door locks, power windows, cruise control, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with CD and 6 speaker system, beverage holders for both the front and rear, map lights, steering wheel-mounted audio controls, interior trunk release, keyless entry, rear window defroster, and a lockable glove compartment.  Whew, that's a lot and I didn't even list them all!

Now that I've given you about a hundred reasons to go out and test drive this car - What are you waiting for?!
