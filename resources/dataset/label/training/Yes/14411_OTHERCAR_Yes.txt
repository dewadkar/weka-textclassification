            <b>I can't help but wonder if the folks at Infiniti are James Bond fans.  The quirky inventor who fits 007's exotic cars with weapons of mass destruction...  his name is "Q".  Infiniti has the <i><b>Q</b></i>45, loaded with multiple gadgets, gizmos, and even Gatling-gun appearing headlights...  Ignore for now that Infiniti has the <b><i>G</b></i>35, as it puts all kinds of holes in my theory (I just can't hear the Brits saying "Yo, 'G'!  Tea time!").  However, 007's boss is named "M", and Infiniti's new $40K entry is named...  you guessed it, the <i>M</i>45.  Coincidence?  ... Yeah, probably.</b>

Infiniti has been making a pretty nice comeback recently, with a 30% jump in sales, thanks mostly to the G35's strong showing in its rookie year.  Problem is, a significant price gap exists between the G35 and the Q45.  In search of a worthy bridge, Infiniti opted for the Nissan Gloria, a 4-door sedan that's been around in Japan even before the current Q45 was introduced.  Infiniti slapped on their logo, added some luxurious and gee-whiz features, dropped the Q45's heavenly V8 into the mix, and <i>presto</i>!  Infiniti had their bridge...  all for a price in the low 40's.

My father, looking to replace his 1991 Lexus LS400, found this bridge a tempting alternative to the much pricier offerings from other marques.  We drove it together once, then had it loaned to us for a day.  Here are my impressions.

<b>EXTERIOR:  6</b>
The M45 is Infiniti's "middle car" now, but as far as size goes, it's much closer to the Q45:  at 197.2 inches in length, it's only 2.4" shorter than its big brother.

While I admit that the car's looks grew on me the more I looked at it, I must question Infiniti's move here.  The marketing of the car equally confuses me.  This car is called a "muscle car with brains", and the Infiniti website currently has a charming video of the M45 outracing muscle cars of old.  Granted, the car's long rear overhang and long sloping rear window are reminiscent of the old days.  But here's the thing:  as I said before, this car was around in Japan long before it came here, and I highly doubt the Japanese had this "muscle car" idea in mind when they marketed it at home.  
...  Wanna know what I think?  I think Infiniti advertising had no other alternative.  They probably stared at the M45 for hours... <i>days</i>, wondering how they'd explain a luxury sedan that looks like the big boats of yesteryear to the American consumer.  

In addition, there are some other flaws in the car's design.  One of these flaws is the frameless windows, which is more than just an issue of aesthetics...  this dated design is likely to rattle as the car ages.  I'm not crazy about the car's simpleton front grille, either.  The car's profile really lends a "Lincoln Town Car" look, which doesn't bode well for a car trying to lend itself a sporty image.

On the other hand, I did start liking the look the more time I spent with it.  Especially in black or silver, the M45 looks quite stately when on the road.  The blinkers on the side mirrors add a practical and classy touch.  Plus, this car looks quite handsome in motion, exuding more of that advertised "muscle car" demeanor.

<b><i>UPDATE!  (1/30/02)</b></i>
<i>Now, this is just a rumor, but I heard from a credible source that the folks at Infiniti caught on quickly that the M45 isn't receiving the warmest reception based on its styling.  Word on the street is that Infiniti will be releasing a new, totally redone M45 built on an extended FM platform (the one the G35 is built on).  It could come out as early as the first quarter of 2004, badged as a 2005 model.  We'll see what happens...</i>


<b>INTERIOR:  8</b>
Much has been said in the critical media of this car's interior...  some good, lots bad.  I personally liked it, with only a few caveats.  Here's the breakdown:

<b><i>Room:</b></i>  Probably the biggest criticism of this car is its lack of space.  True, for such a large car, you'd think there would be more in there, and it also has an appreciable lack of rear legroom on paper when compared to the competition.  And yes, the M45 feels cozier than the airy Q45.  But the M45 isn't <i>confining</i>, and I think there's plenty of room for four adults to fit comfortably, five in a squeeze.  My first of only two problems (minor at that), was that, at 6' 3" the headroom with a sunroof was limited for me.  The seat can be lowered, fortunately.  The trunk is the second problem.  Would you believe the M45 has <i>less</i> trunk space than the G35 sedan?  That's right...  and, there's no pass through or folding rear seats.  A big mistake on Infiniti's part.

<b><i>Seats:</b></i>  The seats are firmly bolstered and are quite comfortable with plenty of thigh and lumbar support.  My father had back pain the morning of our drive, but it was gone by the time we were done driving.  An optional package gives you <b>heated and cooled seats</b>, which you really don't see in cars in this class.  Lateral support could have been more generous, however.

<b><i>Dash:</i></b>
While I'm not crazy about their orange hue, the full-instrumentation gauges are very easy to read and very visible even in bright sunlight.  The instrument cluster is almost identical to that seen in the Q45, which overall is a good thing.  The 5.8" LCD display gives you all kinds of information, including gas mileage, maintenance schedule, tire pressure, and radio/climate control settings.  My only gripe here is similar to that in the Q45:  for even the simplest functions (like adjusting the temperature or changing the station), it takes more keystrokes than on my 1996 Isuzu Rodeo.  Why do they do this?  Fortunately, Infiniti's available <b>Voice Recognition Technology</b> by Visteon offsets these complications.  Just push the "talk" button on the steering wheel, say your command, and the computer follows your command automatically.  When I drove the Q45, I thought this was just a gimmick, but I've changed my mind on that.  I'd say its a worthwhile option to consider.  Overall the layout is clean and functional.

<b><i>Sound system:</b></i>  
The 7-speaker, 225-watt Bose sound system performs admirably.  One of the better ones I have heard, even though I'm not the biggest Bose fan.  All ranges are well-represented, although I wish the control center would allow you to adjust more than just the bass and the treble.  With all the technology in this car, don't you think they could have put a graphic equalizer or something?  Another small, small gripe:  the cassette deck is nice, but it's on the center panel, while the six-CD changer is in the glovebox.  I agree with the critics on this one:  swap 'em.  Like the Q45, this system uses the Bose AudioPilot feature, which senses outside noise and adjusts the volume of the radio automatically to compensate.

<b><i>Climate control:</b></i>
The days were just beautiful when we drove the M45, so I really can't say much about the power of the cooling or heating system.  However, it works quietly and automatically.  You can also set the temperature vocally using the Voice Recognition system.


<b>ENGINE:  9</b>
We now come to this car's best feature:  the engine.  It is the same 4.5L V8 340hp, 333 lb-ft torque engine that is found in the Q45.  Last year, the folks at Infiniti improved the gearing on this engine for better acceleration, and these changes were thankfully included in the M45.  So, both the M45 and Q45 essentially have identical engines...  which is a good thing.  Acceleration in the M45 is brisk (clocked 0-60 in 6.1 seconds by <i>Road & Track</i>), and delivery seemed less subtle than in the 2002 Q45 (I haven't driven the 2003 Q yet).  The engine makes a satisfying growl when punched, but is silent during highway cruising.  Although some literature out there says that the M45's transmission crudely hunts for gears, it really seemed fine to me.

The manumatic is unfortunately the sole flaw that I find: there's just way too much hesitation after you tap the lever before the car responds (the Q45 is guilty of the same thing).  This probably isn't that big of an issue, since most drivers will just leave the shifter in "Drive" 95% of the time.


<b>HANDLING:  8</b>
Equipped with independent struts in front and an independent, multi-link rear suspension in the rear, the M45 felt surprisingly balanced in turns and emergency maneuvers for a car this size.  While the Infiniti Q45 can be reluctant to dance, the M45 is much more willing by comparison.  You can also get an appreciation for the progressively weighted steering, which gets heavier as speeds increase.  While this setup does not provide the same feedback as a Bimmer, there wasn't a real sense of "disconnectedness" like I felt in the Q45.  While the performance Michelins do a nice job of keeping the M45 planted to the road, there is some perceptible body roll if you take a curved road too fast.  Did I mention I would have liked a little more side bolstering in the seats?  Oh, yes.  I did already.

The biggest flaw in this department is the large turning circle:  40 whopping feet, to be exact.  The larger Q45 has a 36.1 ft turning circle, which leaves me wondering...  what gives?  It wasn't too much of a challenge getting into tight parking spots and the like, but a few turnarounds were a little closer than I liked.


<b>RIDE:  8</b>
A couple of minutes on the highway and you'll realize that the M45 has a different mission than the Q45.  It definitely feels sportier than its big brother when on the road.  Tuned roughly to the equivalent of the Q45's "Sport Mode", the ride is tighter, and the interior noise is slightly louder.  Cruising at 80mph, however, the cabin is silent...  very different from the smaller G35.  The tight ride doesn't allow much harshness, but hit the major road irregularities and you have some problems.  Tire noise is evident but not intrusive, and at highway speeds, this car makes a pretty nice cruiser.  Some folks might wish it had the adjustable suspension as is seen in the Q45, but on the whole I found this suspension to be pretty acceptable for everyday driving.  It certainly keeps you in touch with the road more than the Q45 or, perhaps even the Lexus GS430.  Wind noise is pleasantly quiet, and sound insulation from the outside works well.


<b>RELIABILITY & BUILD QUALITY:  9</b>
Although this car is in its first year here in the States, it's been around for a long time, and its shared components with the Q45 have also been around for a while.  You also are provided with Infiniti's generous warranties...  you can even purchase a <i>refundable</i> extended warranty.  Infiniti is also well-known for good service, which sometimes has been enough for people to shell out more cash for the Maxima-based I35.  My experience with Infiniti dealers has been exceptional.

Assembled in Tochigi, Japan, Infinitis are generally very well-assembled with few problems...  a notch or two behind Lexus, but still very good.  This M45 was no exception, with generally widespread use of quality materials and little tolerance for gaps and imperfections.  The only quality glitch I noticed was a slightly cheap-looking trunk.  That's it.

<b>SAFETY:  9</b>
Although I could not find any crash test data for the Nissan Gloria, the M45 comes with impressive loads of safety equipment compared to its competitors.
The M45 is equipped with a full set of vented disc brakes, with electronic brake force distribution brake assisted ABS.  Infiniti's Vehicle Dynamic Control stability control system also comes standard (it can be switched off).  A vehicle security system, xenon headlights, and a microchip key are standard.  Dual front airbags, side airbags, and side curtain airbags for front and rear are standard.  The M45 also comes with Infiniti's Active Head Restraint system, which raises the headrest up and forward in the event of a rear collision to help prevent whiplash.

<b>VALUE:  9</b>
Even in its base form, the M45 comes with enough features to satisfy most consumers, running at a base list price of $43,200.  Loaded to the gills (with the premium and convenience packages), the price tops out at about $46-47K.  This includes trick options like laser-guided cruise control, Voice Recognition, and climate controlled seats, to name a few.  Compared to the competition, this price is very reasonable.  The Audi A6 has a base price that is closer to the M45, but Audi has made an art of making the sticker rise fast once options are added.  The Lexus GS430's base price has risen such that it is too close to the LS430...  so much so that Lexus has actually cut way back on production of the GS430.  The GS300 is underpowered by comparison.  The BMW 5-series with a similar amount of equipment will run you $10-15K more than the M45.  Same goes for the Mercedes E-class.  While I was doing my comparisons, I noticed that the M45 was the only car that, completely loaded, still stayed true to its promised price range, while the others only held up such a pretense.  The only exception to this are the American counterparts, the Cadillac DeVille and perhaps the Lincoln LS.  Were it my choice between those three, however, the M45 would get the nod for better performance, reliability, quality, and service.

The only area where Infiniti runs into trouble is when it comes to resale value.  If you plan on owning this car for a long time, it shouldn't matter that much.  Plus, the car's cheaper sticker should help to offset that.  However, if you are more of a short-term buyer (every 3-4 years), this is definitely something you will have to take into consideration.


<b>VERDICT:  SOMETIMES A FINE CAR ISN'T ENOUGH</b>
The M45 has received a lukewarm reception since its debut.  Although I feel many of the car's harsh criticisms are unwarranted (overall, it's a nice car and worth a look), I can't say I think the M45 will be a runaway seller.  Good for you as the buyer, bad for Infiniti.  Why?  Because there's simply more appealing packages out there that look nicer and are better thought out...  this car is merely a good execution of "sprucing up" an older (and aging) model.  Thus far my theory has been correct:  I have yet to see a single M45 on the road, and the only time I've seen one has been in copious quantities on the dealer's lot.  

Does that mean you should pass the M45 up?  Well, no.  You'd be mistaken not to drive it.  The beautiful thing about the car business is that it's all a matter of personal preference.  You're hearing an opinion from someone in his mid-20's.  Talk to my father, on the other hand, and he'll tell you he loved the car and the way it drove.  He also loves the price advantage it has over most competitors.  Still, he's been hesitant to sign on the dotted line, and he can't quite put his finger on why.  That just about sums this car up.
