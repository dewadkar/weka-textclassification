            You may have seen this opinion before, I have revamped it, as it was my first Epinion and I was not happy with its quality.  Here is the refined version:

We currently own two S-10 Blazers, a <b>1984 2 door</b> and a <b>1995 LS</b> model, both are very reliable, fun and smooth to drive, excellent towing and a great all around deal.  Both are 4x4

<b>1995 LS 4 door</b>
First, I�ll start out with the pros.  This vehicle is 4x4, it has a great climbing ability and is very stable on ice.  The roominess is excellent, easily seating five people.  With the split bench 40/60 it increases the cargo space greatly.  The rear seat is huge, there is lots of leg room, almost as roomy as the front seats.  In 47,000 miles we�ve had to change a Ball-Joint, and nothing else.  It hasn�t succumbed to the dreaded GM paint curse, but it was peppered by a cinder truck, leaving $2,400 worth of paint damage.  It has a special edition Purple pearl over Blue.  This makes it change colors in the sun, the only other vehicle I�ve seen this on is a Venture, so it is very unique.  The 4.3 liter Vortec engine puts out an impressive 195 hp, which is plenty for anyone in my opinion.  The Vortec, while increasing power, also increases gas mileage, turning in 30 mpg on the highway with the cruise control on.  It is a four speed automatic.  I tested the 0-60 speed to be around 14 seconds, not impressive, but enough.  Even with the small fourth gear it gets you off of the line quickly.  The push-button on the fly four wheel drive is really nice, since you don�t have to stop or put any effort into getting a little more control in the snow.  The dual off-tone horns are nice, not as good as the 1984�s, but nothing to complain about(unless you�re on the receiving end).  This vehicle has a very quite ride, with no rattles, squeaks or odd noises. The remote keyless entry saves valuable time.  The tailgate release is on the inside, making for a nice streamline release.(Yes, it has a tailgate, small Chevy SUV�s do, unlike Ford�s small SUV�s)  This vehicle has a luggage rack, which would be nice if you had a lot of luggage.  It sports three, count em�3�integrated roll bars.  You can�t feel much safer in a vehicle.  Although it has four wheel anti-lock brakes, I�d rather it didn�t for the snow, but it is really nice on the dry.

Cons for the 1995
The sounds system leaves lots to be desired, as well as the stock stereo face, but I�m yet to see a face that I like in any vehicle.  When getting into the rear seat, on either side, the passenger catches his/her leg on the door trim, causing it to make a snapping sound.  Nothing to worry about, just a little annoying.  The seatbelt light also flashes until you put it on, but not really a con here.  <b>E</b> really means, <b>EMPTY</b>, so don�t try to push it.  A spoiler would be nice to keep dust off of the rear window, but the windowshield wiper works just fine.  Other than that, this vehicle is perfect.

With Chevrolet's motto, &quot;A little security in an insecure world.&quot; I believe that times two, we have a lot of security, I would definitely recommend these to my friends. My family has had no regrets.<br><br>
