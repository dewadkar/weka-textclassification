            My experience with a Ford Escort, is that it is a very excellent vehicle.  I do admit that it does have it's draw backs.  The Ford Escort that I owned had absolutely no pickup.  If you would like a car with some balls, you would not choose the Escort.  If you would like a car that will be reliable and run well, then you would want to purchase an Escort.  I had my Escort for about 6 months and I had absolutely no problems with it.  I sold it for a car with more pickup, but I sold it to a person I am in contact with it and he has had no problems either.  Ford Escort's are also very good on gas mileage.  If you don't have a lot of money to purchase a car, then you won't have that much money for gas.  So, it would be wise to buy a car with good gas mileage.  I would recommend an Escort if you want to get around town, cheap.  It took me, usually $8 dollars to fill my tank and that would last me a week.  My recommendation to you would be to purchase a Ford Escort to save you time and money in repairs you would have to do on a different car.  <br><br>
