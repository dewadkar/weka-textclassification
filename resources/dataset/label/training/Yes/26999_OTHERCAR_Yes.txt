            I am a very frequent seller on <b>Ebay</b> and after literally months of suffering the intolerable and dreadful hardship of scanning items on my <b>Canoscan</b> scanner I decided to finally bite the bullet and purchase a digital camera. After all, my scanner could only reliably produce images of small and flat items - The camera would open up a whole new world for me. It really has!

In choosing my camera I had to weigh up the factors important to me.  I wanted something which could produce clear, crisp photos of small - medium sized objects at close range and with high detail, so the <i>macro mode</i> which featured in this camera was a major selling point. The <i>macro mode</i> allows very small objects to be photographed filling the whole range of the screen/image in remarkably sharp focus.

Of course, I wanted this camera to serve a purpose other than as a tool for Ebay.  I have never had a decent camera and have had some deeply sad experiences with cheap point and shoot models in the past. Many is the time when I would be out on some sort of expedition and see something which would make a wonderful photo.  I would carefully take the shot and be quite excited to see how it would turn out.  Weeks later when I would develop my film I would always be dismayed at the results.  The centre of attention in my wonderful photo would be the size of a pinhead in a grainy, blurry landscape of rather uninteresting nothings.  Never again did I want to take a photo which looked like something I would see if I was underwater looking through the wrong end of a pair of binoculars so the 3x optical zoom had me quite excited and it really lived up to my expectations.  Obviously I would have loved telephoto zoom where I could produce an image of a bee perched on the petal of a flower 200 yards away, but not having a years wages handy to blow on a camera, this was perfectly adequate.

Remember what I was saying about the disappointment of getting your shots back only to discover that that shot you were really eager to see had not come out right?  With the <b>D-450</b> you need never worry about this again!  The surprisingly clear LCD display allows you to instantly view your photo and even review your entire memory. If the photo does not go as planned it is a very simple matter to delete the offending photo and try again.

The <b>D-450</b> comes with a highly configurable flash, which I was pleased to discover I only needed at all in the dimmest of conditions. Nifty options such as <b>Sequence Mode</b> where you can set the camera to snap a bunch of shots one after the other add versatility to the unit and the <b>Panorama Mode</b> finally allows me to take a decent shot of a landscape!

The functions of this camera are too many to list individually and to be honest I have so far experimented with only a handful of them. (The auto-timer is next!).  The software which comes with the camera does it's job, although I feel it could have been a little more full-featured. (I always end up running straight to <b>Paint Shop Pro</b> after downloading my photos).

The unit itself is very attractive and compact, unlike some of the clunky looking models I have seen. The housing is a subdued and tasteful brassy-gold and it comes with a fairly bland and simple, but handy carrying case.

Batteries are chewed through at a rate of knots so a recharger is a must. I have found that once you come to grips with the camera, how it performs and taking photographs it is best to be as conservative as you can with the LCD screen as this is the major source of battery consumption.

The <b>Olympus D-450 Zoom</b> is a fine low/middle end Digital camera which more than deals with my needs.  I really am having a great time with it and have more photos of my cats than I would have ever dreamed.  I am very happy that this Ebay tool has also turned into such a wonderful new toy.<br><br>
