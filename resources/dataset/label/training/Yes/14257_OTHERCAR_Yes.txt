            I wanted to get something bigger and better than a dinky Ford Explorer but didn't want the long whaleboat of a Suburban.  The Tahoe seemed to be everywhere, the Yukon seemed a bit more distinctive, if only by name plate.  In fact, it's the same as a Tahoe.  I love the size and the look.  It's got a great big engine, power everything but sunroof.  It's main drawbacks are 1) there is not 4 wheel drive disc braking and 2) the rear passenger windows only roll down about 5 inches (due to GM being cheap about not spending the $$$ insert opera window frames in the door and allow the window to roll down completely. 

If you have kids and they have friends though, it isn't the truck for you.  The rear seat only seat 3 and only has shoulder straps for 2.  There is no 3rd seat making it impossible to take more than 3 kids in the car (assuming your kids are younger than 12 and can't sit in the front passenger seat).

I have been in Expeditions and while I liked their dashboards, they are way too tall and don't fit in to many parking structures.  I have never had a problem getting into 6'6&quot; parking lots.

Oh yeah, get the rear air conditioning, it's really worth it and keeps the car much cooler.

In spite of it's shortcomings,  I love the truck and would recommend it to others.
