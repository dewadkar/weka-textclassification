            Picture the scene:
I'm 20 years old and my venerable 1985 Subaru wagon is finally petering itself out after 130,000 miles. So what do me and my father do?

We go and buy an '85 Volvo 245 wagon. (Note: 245 means &quot;240 series, 5-door&quot;) Not only that, but we buy one with...130,000 miles on it. Why?

Great God Almighty, these things can run.

Y'see, in my family we've come to trust the Volvos. We love them like nobody's business...we have three of them.

My younger brother is the proud owner of what was my father's original 1988 740 GL wagon. That thing's up to 250,000+ and purring like a kitten.

My sister, who recently got her license, was hunting for a car and found, miraculously, an '89 740 TURBO sedan for $3000. My jaw was on the ground.

While my sister was searching for her &quot;new&quot; car with my father, they ran across this white 240 wagon. Looked beat up, but it was $3000 and they had seen the aformentioned sedan, so they didn't consider it. That is, until my Subaru choked.

One day over the summer between the semesters, Dad and I stopped back at the used-car place. He had driven by and noticed it was down to $2000. Apparently no one was buying. We stopped in.

The owner of the place tried to sell it to us. He remembered my father. my father turned to me and said, &quot;do the talking.&quot; This was my father's impeccable sign of &quot;this is going to be YOUR car, I'm not getting involved besides the money.&quot; I assume most fathers do this when you get your oldest son actually buying a car. 

The owner asked me how much I was willing to spend, and I looked him in the eye and said...&quot;$1500.&quot; He shifted and looked uneasy. He went inside called his brother, the co-owner, at home. Came back out. &quot;Sure we can do it for 1500.&quot; 

&quot;OK, it's done if you fix what's wrong with it. There's leaks.&quot;

So we come back a few days later, check it out, say, OK, and my father turns to the owner and says...&quot;so if I say $1300 and you say $1400 we got a deal?&quot;

The owner sighed, shrugged, and gave it to us for $1400.

A year and a transmission later, this car is unbelievable. The car was well worn. It turned out the &quot;screws&quot; in the front of the tranny had sheared each other to bits, resulting in the car having almost NO climbing power and barely topping 50 MPH on flat ground. The exhaust needed to be replaced, but we saw that coming. It's 15 years old.

Bottom line: I got this car CHEAP. Based on everything I know and love about Volvos, it's going to run forever. The body of this car? A solid &quot;CLANG-CLUNK&quot; when you close the steel doors.

I will survive a nuclear holocaust in my 240.<br><br>
