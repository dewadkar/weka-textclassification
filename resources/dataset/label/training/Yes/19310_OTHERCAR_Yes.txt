            I got this camera for Christmas recently, and it turned out to be a great investment, after having some time to fiddle around with it, I decided it was a great camera and requested it for Christmas, the camera out of the box is a nice camera for 300 bucks, 1280x960 or 640x480 resolutions, and it gives you three quality levels at each size. The 4 megabyte smart media card that comes with it gives you enough storage for 6 of the FINE 1280x960 images which isn�t much, but it does give you 23 FIND 640x480 pictures which is basically a roll of film, so 16megs or a 32meg card is definitely nice to have with this camera.

This camera is lightweight and nice looking, one of the things I like about it is, that it looks so much like a regular 35mm camera from the front and sides (as long as you can�t see the give-a-way LCD display on the back) that it�s almost a deterrent from theft, compared so some of the oddly shaped cameras that are available. The lens is covered by a sliding door, and the flash is permanently in place, since this camera looks like a normal camera it also feels like one, it�s very comfortable to hold. With the option of using the built-in 1.6� LCD display or the standard viewfinder, this camera is definitely easy and comfortable to use.

The picture quality of this camera is outstanding, at any resolution and quality you get excellent output, whether on screen, or on a decent printer (I will review the Lexmark z52 printer soon). You can manipulate the image many different ways without losing its incredible output.

Samples of some of the pictures can be found at www.domainwh0re.com

This camera takes 4 AA Batteries, and with Duracell batteries the life was not to impressive about 100-200 photos per set, so I got a battery charger and a few sets of batteries to go with it, and the NiMH kind give me 300+ pictures per charge� 
<b> Fuji has repacked this item, they now include a battery charger in the box, although some older style ones might still be floating around </b> 

There are a few different options from getting your pictures from the camera to a pc	
-	USB) by far the fastest and fairly convenient method, if you only have one pc, or front USB ports on computers.
-	Floppy disk adapter) this one is convenient if you have multiple computers and you don�t always know where you�ll be loading your pictures, it�s also the slowest method I�ve used

Overall this is a GREAT camera for home use as well as business use, I�d recommend getting this if you�re not sure what you will be using your camera for, and just know that you would want one, because the quality and versatility of this camera make it a truly unique product.
