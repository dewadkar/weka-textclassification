            I am currently in the market for a second mid-size sedan, to replace my 1997 Nissan Sentra and supplement my wife's 2001 Saturn L-200.  In shopping around, of course I am comparing everything to the Saturn we purchased in January, as well as the benchmark Accord and Camry, but desiring to keep the price under $17,000 makes the Sonata and the Kia version of the same car, called the Optima, very attractive indeed.

With the Kia costing roughly $800 more, with a corresponding increase in sophistication, the choice for me bascially comes down to a 4 cylinder Optima or a V6 Sonata, which is actually a more difficult decision than it might seem.

First off, what the two cars share are powertrains, suspension (though with different tuning) and chasis.  Where they differ is feature content, styling, the aforementioned tuning.  The Kia rides a little taughter, and has some upscale touches such as strut-type trunk hinges that don't intrude on the cargo area, and the larger, more comfortable seats from Hyundai's new XG-300.

So how do they drive?  Extremely well, thank you.  The Sonata is almost Buick plush, while the Optima reminds more of a Camry.  Both are extremely supple on rough pavement, and are very quiet at cruising speeds with either the 4-cylinder or the V6.  I preferred the heavier controls of the Optima, but the difference is a subtle one, with the Sonata likely being the better long-distance highway car and the Optima a bit more responsive in abrupt city driving.

It is in seat comfort where the larger seats of the Optima make the choice difficult, these are some of the best chairs in the business, though those in the Sonata are still as good as the ones in my Saturn, which is to say quite excellent indeed.  

Control feel and the appearance of the instrumentation is another area where these cars excel, with the turn signal and headlamp stalks feeling every bit as nice as those in a Honda or Toyota, which is something that until recently no car could claim.  The guages are very clear, though Kia gets the nod for mounting the audio system above the climate controls in current ergonomic practice.  The only nit here is the cupholders of both cars (the same part) are small and shallow, and positioned so as to be very convenient for the passenger, but unintuitive for the driver.

To say that I was impressed with the current generation of Korean mid-sized sedans is an understatement.  When the driving dynamics and comfort are taken into consideration with the build quality (both subjective and as suggested by the 10-year warrantee), I think that a new 4-cylinder Optima will soon share my garage, although that V6 is awefully smooth.
