            I purchased the Dodge to replace my Ford Pickup. I use the pickup to pull an offshore boat and the first trip I actually stopped to make sure the boat had not come loose. The constant power the Cummins engine produces is awesome. If you are looking for a work horse, the Dodge Ram, equipped with the diesel engine is the way to go. 

The only problem I have experienced was a broken fuel linkage at about 50,000 miles. I highly recommend the Dodge 2500.<br><br>
