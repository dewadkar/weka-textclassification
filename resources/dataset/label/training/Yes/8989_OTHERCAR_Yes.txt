            In my recent search for a new car, I heard alot of really good things about Honda's...particularly the Accords.  Some quotes, "You'll get 150,000 miles easily"..."They are very roomy".  Well, for me, those are 2 very important issues.  First, I have not had the best of luck with cars.  Second, I am 6' 2" and 300 pounds.  I need driver-side space.  And the Sonata is bigger than the Accord, hands-down.  I could not even test drive the Accord because the steering wheel, which was a tilt steering wheel, was touching my leg when I sat in it.  But when I sat in the Sonata and put the seat all the way back, there was actually TOO MUCH room.  I could not push the clutch all the way down!  What a surprise, as I had always thought the Hyundai's were small and uncomfortable.  Of course there is a downside to all of that room...the person behind me has little or no room.  But I would rather have it that way than not be able to buy the car at all becuase it is undrivable, as was the case with the Accord.

Let's talk about the price...I am not sure about the specifics regarding other cars, but in my search, the Sonata was $50 a month less than any other car I test drove.  I bought the basic Sonata, with no CD, a 4 cylinder-DOHC engine, a 5-speed manual transmission, no leather, and none of the usual "high-end" options.  But I chose the stick for the gas mileage, and it has not disappointed.  The gas tank fills up with around 15 gallons, and in my first 3 fill-ups, I have gotten 400+ miles each time...yes, I am one of those guys who drives until the gas light comes on.  That rate is 26+ MPG and I do mostly stop-and-go driving.  For a car that I fit in very comfortably, that is great mileage per gallon.

The final great point I will discuss about this car is the warranty, which is widely known as the best warranty around.  I am not even sure what the standard warranty is, because I was interested in extending it to 100,000 miles anyway.  Well, for a little extra monthly, I now have a 10 year/100,000 mile warranty.  For me, that is important because in paying for the car for the next 5 years, I wanted to avoid having a car payment on a car that does not run in my last year.  I would suggest you always do the same.

Now let me go over some of the negative aspects of this car.  First, the backseat room is a minor issue.  If you are someone who consistently drives around 4 adults, you may not want to buy this car.  However, one thing to keep in mind is that I keep my seat all the way back to maximize my driver side space.  When my mother test drove the car, she moved the seat up and there was enough space behind the driver for an adult to sit comfortably.  So I guess the backseat room depends on who is driving.  Second, the engine does run a little bit loud at 40+ MPH, even for a 4 cylinder.  One reason may be the 16 valves that are in this puppy...the DOHC engine makes it run at a pretty good 149 Horsepower for a 4 Cylinder, but it does tend to make it run a little louder.  Which brings me to the third con...the factory-installed radio is not very good.  To be honest, it is horrible.  But I had it in my mind to go out and buy a new car stereo anyway, with a CD in it, so this was not a huge deal for me.  I made sure to buy something loud, and now I can barely hear the engine :)

In closing, if you want a good-looking and affordable car, with plenty of room for the driver, and security of a full bumper-to-bumper warranty for the life of your car payments, then you can't go wrong with the Hyundai Sonata.
