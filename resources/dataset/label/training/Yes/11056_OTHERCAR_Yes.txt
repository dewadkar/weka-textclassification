            We bought our 1995 Mercury Mystique LS as a used vehicle in 1998.  My car had finally worn out after 12 years and it was time to replace it.  We decided on a Mercury Mystique because my mother drives one, and it has been a reliable car for her.  Ours has proved to be just as reliable.

I really love how comfortable, safe, and reliable this car is.  All of the seats are fairly comfortable, although the driver's seat is the most comfortable of all.  It has numerous adjustments, including lumbar support, making it comfortable to sit in for long drives.  I also like how the seatbelts are adjustable in height, since I am short enough that most hit me in the neck.

The Mercury Mystique is a very safe car.  It has features such as ABS and Traction Control, which help the driver to feel even more secure.  It also has dual front airbags, allowing for extra safety in the event of an accident.  One other nice feature are the 5 MPH bumpers, which, as I later found out, really do hold up well in a 5 MPH crash.  I bumped into another car at a traffic light, and there was not a dent in either car.

Finally, I do have to say that this is a very reliable car.  The only time ours has had to go into the shop was when I drove through a car wash with the antenna up.  There have been no major problems whatsoever with this car.  Ours receives regular oil changes, and that is the only work done on it.

The only complaints I have are that the back seat is not terribly roomy and the car has a few quirks.  Now that we're putting a car seat in it, I wish it had a little more room.  However, even with that complaint, I would not trade my car for anything.  Both my mom's car and mine have had a few strange quirks to them, leading me to think that these may be common problems.  If you put gas in your car infrequently, the gas cap tends to stick shut, and it is near impossible to get it open.  My mom actually had to have hers worked on for this problem.  The other recent problem was that part of the front vents has fallen off, both on my mom's and on mine.  It still works fine, but it doesn't look as good.  I also read on someone else's review that their trunk leaks.  Ours tends to do the same, after a heavy rain or a carwash.  As far as we can tell, it is because the casing around the lights doesn't seal.  However, none of these are major problems, just minor quirks.

I would recommend, if you're considering purchasing one, to get the Mystique LS.  It includes such features as the sunroof, premium stereo, and leather-wrapped steering wheel.  It also looks a little sportier and not quite as much like a family car.
