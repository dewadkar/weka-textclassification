               Just a year ago I had decided that I needed a more reliable car than the sports coupe I previously owned especially since I was expecting another child.   I never thought it would be so hard to decide on &quot;the perfect car&quot;.   Finally I found it six months later.

   Now I own a 1995 Dodge Intrepid and wonder how I ever lived without it.  The two doors make it easy to put my children into and out of the car with plenty of room to do so.   The inside has cloth seats which I find to be quite easy to clean and very comfortable.   There is a lot of leg room which allows me to store items for the road trips at the bottom of the car seats and not worry about anything getting crunched together.

   With all the safety features the Dodge Intrepid offers I know that each and every time my family is in the car they will be safe.   Some of these which my car offers includes duel air bags, anti-lock brakes and child locks and windows.

   Another feature that pleases me in how good it is on gas especially since I do a lot of traveling back and forth between the states.<br><br>
