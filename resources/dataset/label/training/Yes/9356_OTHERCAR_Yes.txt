            Olympus! The name alone has been around since I can remember. I was a sales rep of these camera's for quite some time working directly with Olympus. I carried four different models that stores like BestBuys would buy from medium low end to very high end. The C-2500L was one of these models. One of biggest concerns with customers was first Price then Quality (pixels) then Features then last but not least was Lens.

All of these are very legitimate concerns but they would buy on the story behind Olympus. They started making camera's from the beginning and still make the same products today. We all agree &quot;jack of all trades masters at none&quot; these are Sony, Epson, HP, Fuji, GE. These companies make great products BUT, they have their hands in one too many jars. Where as Olympus has been making camera's since I was an infant.

The features like 3X zoom and over 1billion pixel picture quality and all the standard features plus a lot of extra's that stands with all the big boys. But the closer is the LENS. Olympus manufactures their own lenses on their own plant. And been manufacturing lenses for the medical field for a very long time. So the next time you buy a Sony and the lens goes out ask them where they send it and how long its going to take them, you might think twice about buying a camera from somebody who owns a record company!<br><br>
