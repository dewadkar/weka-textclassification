            If you have 3 or more kids under the age of 10 then you must buy this vehicle.  There is no doubt that the Ford Expedition is almost a perfect family suv for families with small children.  First, safety is built in with its big size and high ride.  But did you know that the back bench seat is perfect for kids to enjoy the ride?  The raised, theater seating means kids can see out the window and enjoy the views.  The little ones also have drink cup holders and lots of leg room.  And best of all the kids sit so far back in the truck you can hardly hear their minor fusses.   If the kids are happy, then mom and dad are happy!   Our 3 youngsters behaved remarkably well all the way to Disney World, a 10 hour trip!  Oh, there was lots of room for luggage too.
There are minor defects with the '99 version including a windshield wiper that comes on whenever it wishes, and a back window hold open piston that fails at times to keep the back window up and open, but the dealer will happily cover these items under warranty.
Overall this is one fine family SUV!<br><br>
