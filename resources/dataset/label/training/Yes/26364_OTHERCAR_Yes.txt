            My wife and I were looking at a new Dodge Durango (little bit bigger, V8, Etc.) and came across the Jimmy on a repo lot. The price was so much less, we decided to give up the extra room and power of the Durango. It was not a bad choice. My wife drives it most days. When I get in, it feels a little short. Not uncomfortably so but legroom is at a premium. With the baby seat in the back, I can't run the seat as far back as I want to without crushing the baby seat. The seats are comfortable for the most part but I find very few vehicles that are built for people over six feet tall (except for my dad's 95 Kenworth). My wife is 5'7&quot; and thinks it is just perfect. The Jimmy has plenty of power from the 4.3 V6. I have never had a problem merging on the Interstate or keeping up with traffic. I don't know the specs on the motor but it has plenty of Ghias for me. The wheelbase is a little short for a super ride but the 15&quot; wheels make up for a little of that roughness, if it had 14&quot; wheels the ride would be a lot worse. It tends to &quot;clunk&quot; a lot when going over our dirt road and even rougher driveway. Cornering roll isn't too bad, its no Corvette but it handles better than something with this short a wheelbase and this high a center of gravity normally does. And the center of gravity is pretty high it seems. A crosswind will wear you out on the highway. Not to the point of loss of control, but you can feel every gust. We haven't been on a long trip in it yet, but with my wife's parents living almost a thousand miles away (and in the mountains) I would imagine we will give the thing a workout one of these days. The drivetrain is solid, torquey motor, super slick transmission and excellent brakes (did I mention 4 wheel disc with anti lock?). The pedals are a little close together for someone with a size 12 foot and take a little getting used to. But overall we are pleased with out purchase.<br><br>
