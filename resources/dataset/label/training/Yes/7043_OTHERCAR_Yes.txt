            My knowledge of photography is limited to say the least. I wanted a camera that could think for its self and work out the correct settings automatically for each occasion, dark, sunlight,indoor, outdoor etc. I also hate reading manuals so I also wanted something I could figure out by just looking at the menu options and using common sense. I GOT ALL THE ABOVE AND MORE! The camera had just finished its initial 24 hour charge as recommended by Sony for the first time the camera is charged from new. I wanted to play with it for a while and test it. The picture quality produced by this little camera is fantastic to say the least. I tested in bright sunlight, dimly lit room and I even took several closeup shots of my ugly face expecting to get red eye I have been reading about so much reviewing all manufacturers cameras. All I got was perfect pictures every time and no red eye at all. The settings I had were default except for the time and date which I changed as soon as the camera booted up for the first time and the mode was in simple point and shoot. I would also like to point out that red eye reduction was switched off. I can't comment on battery life yet because I am writing this review immediately   after testing the camera for the first time but I have a feeling I wont be let down by the battery running out as I always turn my camera off after I have taken the shots I need to take and turn the camera back on as and when I need to. I have not tested the movie mode yet but from what I can gather from other user reviews this feature is another one of the many strengths this camera has and far superior to other manufacturers in terms of quality and also the fact that the length of the movie you can record is only limited by the size of the memory stick which I need to upgrade before I can really test this feature for myself.

I am very very happy with my choice and very relieved I went for the Sony DSC-P10. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA!

PS: When I choose a product like a camera I insist that it is well made and feels very high in quality to the touch. The DSC-P10 feels very solid and strong even though it is a small ultra compact. Another reason I bought this camera because of the metal housing instead of plastic like some cameras (even previous Sony models). Lastly, for those like me who doesn't like manufacturing done in cheap labor countries like China to save costs and often sacrificing quality just to remain competitive etc.... THIS CAMERA IS MADE IN JAPAN!!! (Well done Sony for using common sense)
