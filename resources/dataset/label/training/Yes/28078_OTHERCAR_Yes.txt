            I have never driven a vehicle like this.  We just got back from the Poconos, and anyone who knows that area knows about those winding, hilly 2-lane roads that eat minivans for lunch.  Well, my Rendezvous LOVED those roads -- didn't want to leave :-)

The highway fuel economy is actually closer to 30 MPG than the 26 MPG stated for the CXL AWD.  For city driving, it's closer to 16.

The Versatrak AWD provides great stability and confidence in less-than-ideal conditions, unlike my old Caravan, which was all over the road if it was raining.

The kids like the captain's chairs in the second row, where they also have their own audio and climate controls.  The third seat folds flat, making lots of room for our two dogs.  The Heads-Up display is a Godsend, and will alert you to things like low tire pressure without taking your eyes off the road.  Also, the built-in compressor that comes with the towing package means you'll never have to deal with a gas station air hose again, or kill yourself blowing up a 3-man fishing boat.

This vehicle is everything the Tiger Woods commercials claim it to be.  It is a true luxury SUV with minivan capacity.  I recommend it to everyone.
