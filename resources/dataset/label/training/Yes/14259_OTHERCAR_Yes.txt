            I had owned a 1990 Subaru Legacy AWD for 6 years and was very pleased with the foreign car capability and design.  Therefore, I was in the market again for an AWD since I live in an area of the country with tons of snow and I spend a good deal of time driving.  I made an extensive search on the internet and discovered the Audi.  I had not given Audi a thought before, but thought &quot;why not at least test drive one.&quot; 

 So I test drove a 1992 Audi 100S.  It was fantastic--like no other car I had ever driven.  I continued my search until I discovered the 1993 100CS Quattro.  It has a more modern look (some people think it is newer than it really is); the interior leather has held up very well and the paint has only barely started to chip--no rust--even after 7 years. 

 The car is a breeze to drive.  There is very little road vibration felt even after riding in it for 8 hours.  The seats are very comfortable and heated too!  Plenty of leg &amp; head room.  The quattro is excellent--walked right up a hill covered with 4 inches of snow when every one else was fish tailing.  

The ABS are superb!  What I do not like about the car is that it is a bit sluggish around 30 mph; after that--look out.  You really have to watch that speed!  Also, as with other cars, there are some things that the home mechanic cannot fix himself. 

The Audi 100CS Quattro is a totally solid car.  I can only imagine what it would be like to drive one new.  I would highly recommend it to my friends.<br><br>
