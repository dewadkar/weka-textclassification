              Hi my name is Ethan and I have owned two crown victorias in my life and they are wonderful cars.  They are very reliable and will run forever.  I have never been left stranded by my car.  It is also one of the most comfortable cars to ride in.  It has a lot of room and comfortable seats.  The only disadvantage to this car is the size.  It takes a couple tries to get it parked strait even though I have been driving it for several years.  But besides the the fact that the car is big its a joy to have and drive.<br><br>
