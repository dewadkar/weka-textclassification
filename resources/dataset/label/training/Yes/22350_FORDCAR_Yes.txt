            I have owned several Fords, this is my first Expedition. 

I have a 2000 Expedition Eddie Bauer. It has all the toys, big V8, Rear Air, Leather, 6 CD Changer, Big wheels.

Yes, it uses a lot of gas. I get around 12 mpg in city traffic consistently. I get around 17 on flat stretches of Interstate highway.

The pros:

It is so quiet the first month I had to ride with my drivers side window cracked open because I felt like I was in my living room with the CD playing. I felt oblivious to what was happening outside my truck (not a good thing).

It moves! I can blast on and around traffic. Good visibility, great ground clearance. It can tow around 7300 lbs cargo. It rides real stable with 5 adults in the truck.

The sound system is awesome.

I fear no condition. I have driven in some pretty dicey conditions and the 4wd is bulletproof.

It has never been in the shop and is now approaching 3 years old. Only oil changes and one tire rotation and balance in that time.

It doesn't have the rocking horse motion of the Explorer on concrete highways with separator strips. Smooth and stable. I have air ride suspension too which can dampen some of the bumps.

The down side:

It is 6'5" high. Watch what parking garages you want to park in and etch the 77" into your memory lest you might have an insurance claim. I haven't but others have. Be forewarned. It is tall!

350 miles on a tank of gas doesn't lend itself well to real long trips. I wished it had a bigger tank but it rides better than an Excursion which did have one, that's why I picked this.

It wobbles in the wind, especially on an interstate. It is not as stable as an Explorer but it does NOT have the rocking horse action of that either. 400 miles in this and you feel great. 400 miles in my EB Explorer I had and you were ready for bed!

My opinion. Buy one if you have a lot of rug rats and want safety and convenience in one package.
