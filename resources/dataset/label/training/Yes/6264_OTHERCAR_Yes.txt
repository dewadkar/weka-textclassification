            I bought a GMC Sierra 1500 4X4 extended cab 4 door to replace a 1997 Dodge RAM 1500 4X4 extended cab.  The GMC is a far superior truck in my opinion.  The Big 5.3L V-8 has much better throttle response and power than the Dodge 5.1L V-8.  The GMC has more room inside, better standard equipment and handles much better, especially in the rain.  The truck drives like a car, albeit a very large, powerful car.

I love the Stereo in this truck and I love all of the storage bins, pockets, power outlets and such.  Also, the lumbar supports in the seats are excellent on a long trip.

The gas mileage is not that great, about 14mpg average.  I added a tonneau cover to mine and boosted the mileage to 15mpg, still not great, but that's what you get for owning a big workhorse of a truck.

The only nit I have with the truck is that the braking is sometimes unpredictable when the A/C is running and you are travelling at low speeds.  The brakes will not pick up immediately, and then will pulse suddenly.  I think it may have to do with the booster not getting adequate vacuum at low RPM.  Anyway, it doesn't ever present any danger, it is just annoying.

I would recommend this truck over the Dodge RAM any day of the week.  Sure the Dodge looks tougher, but the GMC is a far better built and better driving truck.<br><br>
