            First a little background on the current generation Golf (Golf IV).  It shares the same platform as the New Beetle/Jetta, as well as the Audi TT.  It has scored fairly well in government crash testing (five stars) and is standard with front/side airbags (later '01 models will have side curtain airbags), four wheel disc ABS brakes, traction control (on the 1.8 model), 15" all season tires, side protection door beams, and a full size spare tire. The Golf is available in three engine types: the base four cyl. 2.0L, 1.9L Turbo Diesel, and the 4 cyl.1.8L Turbo.  The Diesel gets well over 50 MPG, and the 1.8T is quite quick.  The 2.0L's are at best medocore.  Volkswagen's warrantee is 12 month/24K miles for bumper to bumper and roadside assistance, 10yrs/100K-mile powertrain, and the first two years maintenance is free.  2002 will see a longer bumper to bumper warrantee.

My 2001 Volkswagen Golf is amazingly packed with features that you won't find in a car of this class.  I believe the base GL model alone has over forty standard features.  I purchased my Golf GLS 1.8 Turbo in January of '01.  To date I have clocked over twelve-thousand blissful miles on it's digital odometer.  My suggestion is to opt for the 1.8L Turbo engine (requires premium unleaded).  The car handles and performs top notch.  Pickup is quick (0-60 in about seven seconds), and it hums along quietly at 80MPH like a car costing much more.  Among it's standard features is the violet and red illumination in the instrument cluster, power windows/locks with express driver AND passenger, tilt/telescoping wheel, AM/FM/Cass with eight speakers, heated mirrors, and driver/pass side lighted vanities.  I opted for the Luxury Package, which included a tilt/sliding sunroof, Monsoon stereo, heated seats, and 15" alloy wheels.  

Volkswagens are temperamental; therefore my ownership has not been trouble free.  Most of the following was repaired under Volkswagen's 24month/24 thousand bumper to bumper warrantee: paint peeling off front lower bumper, repaired.  CD changer malfunctioned, replaced.  Various rattles and squeaks, including the doors and sunroof, unsolved.  Tire vibration, solved with balance.  Oil consumption (which the dealer states is normal, especially the 2.0L model, up to 1 quart per 1K miles).   

From my experiences on line and talking to other Volkswagen owners, the things that will most likely go wrong with your new Volkswagen: Window regulator (window falls into the door), MAF (mass airflow) sensor, O2 sensor, squeaks and rattles.  All of which VW knows about and most likely would be repaired at no cost.  

All in all I absolutely love my Volkswagen.  I get comments all the time on how good looking my little VW is. It rides and performs like a luxury car, is extremely safe, gets good gas mileage (24-30 mpg), and has a beautifully laid out interior. I'd definitely recommend this vehicle, and can't wait to purchase my next.
