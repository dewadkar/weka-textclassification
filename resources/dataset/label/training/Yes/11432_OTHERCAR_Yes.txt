            Okay yes my title was cheesy, but what can I say? I love this car. Not only because it is reasonably priced, has lots of room, is big, has a nice suspension, and the fact that you can put a great sound system in it, I love it because it so great looking. I know outer beauty isn't everything, but the interior make-up of this baby is just great too. In fact, I am so impressed with this vehicle, I am going to buy one fairly soon. I had one and sold it for a more current model. I encourage all fellow car goers who prefer a nice ride over a bad one, a cheap car over an expensive, a high quality versus low, and a roomy car verses cramped to get out of the house and at least see this baby today! You'll be shocked. Talking about getting what you paid for AND................. SO MUCH MORE!!! Wooooooweeeeeeeee! Geez, this SUV is great!<br><br>
