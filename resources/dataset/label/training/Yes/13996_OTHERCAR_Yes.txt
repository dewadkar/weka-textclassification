            Across the board the Honda Accord is an excellent vehicle. My current Accord (my 2nd) will not be my last. I bought this one over some more luxurious (and expensive) cars because of it's proven track record (personal experience) The positives of this vehicle are: dependability, durability, mileage, safety, and smoothness of ride. The negatives: can become uncomfortable on very long trips, somewhat pricey and maintenance costs, although few are high. The vehicle is perfect for the commuter or student. Not the best for the travelling salesman. <br><br>
