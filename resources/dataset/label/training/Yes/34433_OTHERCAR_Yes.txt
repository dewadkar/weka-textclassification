            I never would have thought that I would own a Saturn.  I have to thank the salesman from the Saturn dealership for calling my mother.  He was calling around to see if people were interested in getting a new car.  My mother was not interested, but she told him that I was looking into trading in my old car.  So, she gave him my phone number, he called me, and the next day, I was test driving Saturns.

In the end, I got myself into the Saturn SC1.  The power plant for this car is a 1.9L SOHC L4 engine, which produces 100 horsepower.  My car has an automatic transmission, which produces decent acceleration with this engine.  I love the exhaust note the car produces when the engine is running at high engine speeds.  When cruising, the engine is fairly quiet.  

The inside of the car is very nice and has plenty of options to go around.  My SC1 came with air conditioning, rear window defroster, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, remote keyless entry, AM/FM/Cassette/CD stereo, and cruise control.  The back seat can hold only two people.  On the plus side, the back seat has a center console with cup holders.  I have never seen that before in a coupe.  The folding rear seat-back is good if you need a little more room to fit something that is a little too big for the trunk.  

There are also a couple of more options that were installed at the dealership.  I have tinted windows, pin striping, and VIN Etch.  "VIN Etch?", you say?  Here is the Bottom Line:  If my car is stolen and not recovered within 30 days, I will receive $2500, which does not include whatever my insurance company will pay.  A little extra security is always good.

Probably the most interesting feature on the SC1 is the little third door located on the driver's side.  I love it because it makes my car very unique compared to other coupes.  It gives me better access to the back seat when retrieving stuff I put back there.  It also helps people trying to get in and out of the back seat.

The people at Saturn of Irving (Irving, Texas) were absolutely wonderful.  They did a great job in helping me get into a NEW car.  Originally, I wanted to get a Saturn SC2, but it was a little out of my price range.  They worked with me and helped me get into a Saturn SC1.  I am paying $325.80/month for 60 months, and I am satisfied with that price.  I am sure to return to Saturn of Irving the next time I need a new car.
