            After thoroughly researching the Sports Utility market, we bought our Expedition in May 1999, right after our first child was born. Since our families are more than 2 hours away, we were looking for a comfortable, reliable, well-equipped sports utility vehicle that would accommodate a Siberian Husky and her crate, a stroller, a car seat and luggage and still have room for extra passengers. 

We are extremely happy with our Expedition and find it to be a comfortable ride. We recently drove it from Chicago to Florida with three adults and baby. We drove straight through (a 20 hour trip) and were surprised at how comfortable the seats were. Stopping every 4 hours to fill up with gas was the only downfall to the trip. It takes approximately $30.00 to fill the tank &amp; cost us around $200.00 for the round trip.

Chicago weather always brings snow and we have had the opportunity to test the All Wheel Drive feature. The Expedition didn't skip a beat in the snow. It handled very well, never sliding once. 

One of my favorite features of the Expedition is how high up you are. Road visibility is awesome. The only vehicles you still can't see over are semi trucks. 

I would recommend this vehicle to people who are looking for a spacious and sporty vehicle. 

NOTE: In town driving requires the gas tank to be replenished frequently.
