            It is difficult do pick up your 35mm camera, shoot 80 pictures, take it to a one hour photo place, get it home and scan it in under an hour.  With this camera, you don't need to pay extra to get your memories developed.  Instead of them being your keepsake moments, they become the moments you paid to have put on glossy paper.

So, why a digital camera?

After being online for over ten years I thought I deserved a neat toy.  Needless to say I spent hours debating over a &quot;webcam&quot; and a digital camera.  After reading reviews, I was almost convinced that this camera wasn't worth the money.  Then again, the camera was compared to cameras up into the 1000 dollar range. So, I decided to take my chances however and low and behold, I was surprised.  Not only does this take amazing pictures but it is fairly easy to figure out and comes with everything you need to start taking pictures in an instant.  I'm planning on taking this with me to college in a few months as I'm sure there will be a lot to see and with a digital camera like this, I can have the pictures online for parents and friends in less than an hour.<br><br>
