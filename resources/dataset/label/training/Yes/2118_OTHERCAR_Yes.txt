            After the recent revamping of the Mercedes E Class line, BMW felt compelled to respond by redesigning the already successful 5 Series line.  The question of whether or not the technological improvements and new look of the 5 Series answer the challenge of competing with the new E-class arises.  As I will explain in this review, the answer to this question is yes, and then some.

<b>Before I begin..</b>
I feel it is necessary to note that I have extensive personal experience with the new 2004 5 Series, specifically the 2004 BMW 530i.  My father recently purchased this car, and I have driven it in numerous conditions on city roads, suburban roads, and interstates.  My experience with this car is sufficient to write a credible review.  Now that I have that cleared up, let's get to the good stuff...

<b>Style</b>
I rarely would begin a review of an automobile with the style of the design of the vehicle rather than the performance aspects, but I must make an exception with the new BMW 5 Series.  This car is simply stunning.  The new sleek design combines the mean look of a sports car with the classy appearance of a sedan.  The design is drastically different than that of just a year ago on the 2003 5 Series.  The car has a more modern, heavier look that so many of the auto makers are going towards today; however, fewer makes and models look as good as this baby.

<b>Handling</b>
For those who know BMW vehicles, this category of performance is always a sure win.  I have always been impressed with the handling of BMW vehicles I have driven, including 3 Series, 7 Series, and the X5.  This new 5 Series is no different.  The car has superior comfort on the road with little to no vibrations.  The car handles curves beautifully at higher speeds.  Handling curves at speeds that most cars simply cannot handle is one of my favorite things to do with this amazing car.

<b>Engine Performance</b>
The engine size varies for the different 5 Series models (525, 530, 545).  The car I have driven, the 530i, comes with a 225 horsepower 6-cylinder engine.  The 545i comes with the 8-cylinder.  The 530i has great pick up even for a 6-cylinder engine and accelerates very smoothly.  The 8-cylinder 5 Series cars add much more acceleration and performance, but you will definitely be paying for it as the price increases surely.  Overall, the engine performance is very sufficient and pleasent.

<b>Conclusion</b>
In comparing this car to its main competitor, the Mercedes E-Class, I would choose the BMW 5 Series.  I believe it has a better look, handles better, and compares under the hood.  The E-Class is much more expensive on average compared to the BMW 5 Series.  The 530i ranges from the low to mid 40,000's and the 545i ranges in the upper 50,000's.  The E-Class ranges from upper 40,000's to low 60,000's for, in my opinion, an inferior automobile.  

You cannot go wrong with this car.  If the 540i and the 545i are too expensive for your bank account, the 530i or even the 525i is definitely not a bad way to go.  You still get the same great style and look of a car that looks to be priced over fifty grand, and the engine performance is definitely not poor.  I would absolutely recommend this vehicle; BMW hit the nail on the head with the 2004 5 Series.
