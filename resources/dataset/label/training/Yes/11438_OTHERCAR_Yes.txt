            With so many cameras to choose from Sony made it easier to pick out something different from the crowd.  Their line of Mavica camera's in general have caused a commotion but throw in the concept of saving your images to a 3" CD-R/RW disc and you've just added "cool" to smart.   Despite the camera being a tad bulkier - it has as sleek design and isn't all that heavy.  Even the rechargeable battery didn't  seem to  add weight to the body.  The camera boasts 2.1 megapixels which will let users to snap some clear pictures.  This camera lacks what the MVC-CD1000 has which is a viewfinder.  You'll have to use the LCD viewscreen to center and capture your images but you can buy an optional snap-on viewfinder (its a little geeky considering it just snaps on to the viewscreen).   The on-screen  menu is fairly easy to understand but you'll want to peruse through the manual since it does carry quite a bit of information.  Battery life is good - average time on a full charge is about 150 minutes - takes about 2 hours forf a full charge so you might want to get a few extra batteries and charge them ahead of time for big projects.  

Initializing the disc will require a stable and quiet surface.  Any jogging or movement during initializing will cause it to fail.  Luckily this camera uses rewriteable discs so you won't lose discs to a sneeze or a over friendly cat jumping onto your desk.  Once you initialize, you're ready to go.  Naturally how many images you can save to disc will vary according to your set resolution but you can delete unwanted images along the way.  Once you have snapped your pictures and are ready to edit and print you can either hook up your camera to your PC or Mac (USB hookup not supported for Mac) or you can "finalize" your disk to be read in the cd-rom drive of your computer.   You can re-use or add to the disc by  "unfinalizing" the disc.  It takes about a minute to finalize.

There are so many features included with this camera its almost overwhelming.  The camera is capable of taking images for an MPEG movie (both motion and clip-motion)  and with the built in mic you get good quality sound.  I actually was amazed at how well it picked up sound.  The microphone isn't only for your movie productions but also for adding comments to still photo's.  A great way to make notes on who, what and where (when is taken by the on-board date stamping).   The MVC-CD200 also gives you the option of selecting image format.  From "normal" to including options for TIFF, eMail and text.  You also have the capability of having auto-focus or manual focus which comes in handy for close ups (Macro option is available).  You have a nice selection of image effects to choose from - fairly standard nowadays - B&W, Sepia, Solarize, Negative Art.  Nothing fancy but fun.   One of my favorite features is the Zoom and Trim.  Basically it allows you to take an already shot image, zoom in and trim unwanted areas out of the image and re-record. You still maintain the original image so don't fret if what you've edited isn't quite right.   There are plenty of playback options from multiple images (versus seeing your photos one by one), you can rotate images, you can hook your camera up to the tv (cables included).  This camera does not lack options.

Overall, I'm pleased with this camera.  It has provided great quality images with plenty of options.  It is quick and I don't have to worry about memory limitations since the 3" discs provide ample room.
