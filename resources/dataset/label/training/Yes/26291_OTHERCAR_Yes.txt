            My old car was breaking down every week, so it was in and out of shops on a regular basis, which meant that it was time for me to purchase a new car.  
We all knew that my car would not be able to take me to and from my college, so we decided it was time to buy a new car. 
The choice was easy to make about which car I would purchase because my brother had a Honda Civic, and my parents had a Honda Accord. Well, since there are only two of us children, I had to get the same make as my brother.
About three weeks ago, my parents purchased a HOnda Civic DX, two door for me.  It is silver with dark grey interior. I was so happy to drive my first brand new car off the lot.
The car runs great. It runs smooth, and it has some power to it.
The only thing that bothers me about the car, is the loud noise that is makes when you accelerate.  I guess it just makes me nervous because I think the engine is going to explode.  But, after a few weeks, and a few three hour trips, I am used to the noise, and it does not bother me anymore.
I have taken a few long trips inside of this car, and I was surprised not to feel cramped when I exited the car. I really do think the seats were made just for me. SMile!
I definitely think that this car is perfect for younger people. The car is not too big, but just the right size. It comes in many colors and anyone can enjoy it.
I know I am!!!
