            We all hate the process of going to buy a new car, but we just love driving them. The Chrysler Cirrus is the car I have chosen and have nothing but great things to say about it. The LXI version comes with leather interior and all the bells and whistles. It is a very sporty, yet incredibly comfortable ride. The four door model outshines most of the sportier 2 door models out there. If you are feeling lucky buy it in black but be prepared to spend more at the carwash than you did at the dealership. For under $20,000 it is a great bargain, leaving my friends in their more expensive foreign cars very jealous.<br><br>
