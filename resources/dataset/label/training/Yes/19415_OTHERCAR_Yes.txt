            We weren't even in the market for buying a vehicle when we saw this and test drove it.  We bought it that day.  One month later we bought a second one.  

The vehicle has lots of room inside with all kinds of handy storage places.  (That always tweaks my buttons - lots of nooks and crannies for stuff.)  It has a fold-out table that I will probably never use but so what -- it's there if I ever need it.  

We use it primarily for commuting and driving around town.  We have not used it in any rugged environment and don't ever plan to.  It meets our needs very well.

One nice thing is that you don't have to climb up into it.  You almost need a ladder to get into some of the larger vehicles of this utility type.  That has never appealed to me.  Also, it fits into parking spaces!  Maneuvering it is a snap.  I like the ride - highways, city, country.  Has the right amount of pep.  I like the dealer's service.  I like everything about it.  

This is probably also a good vehicle for people with back problems because of the ease of getting into and out of it.  <br><br>
