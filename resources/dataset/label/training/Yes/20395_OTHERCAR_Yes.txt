            The best kept secret in the U.S. car market is how good the turbo-diesel engine has become and it's only available in VW Golfs and Jettas. I have a 2003 Golf GL 4dr 5sp with the TDI engine and it is a great car! I'm getting 40-50 mpg in an engine thats hardly broken in. Diesel engine has very useable torque which makes it feel subjectively quick in everyday traffic. Cruising at 70-90 mph in freeways is very relaxing and even in 5th gear passing is easy due to the torquey engine. Compared to the gas engine Golf, the engine feels smoother and revs even better between 1500-4000 rpm due to the turbo. The interior befits a more expensive car and exudes Germanic quality. So do the tight body structure and well damped ride. The handling is not the best in class because of excessive body lean. Cupholders are worst I've seen but who cares! This car is about $1,200 more expensive than the gas version but if you drive a lot of miles a year, that's easily paid back with today's gas prices. However, this engine is not even the latest turbo diesel design. VW has more advanced turbo diesels on sale in Europe and is rumored to introduce a Passat with a more powerful TDI engine next year in U.S.
Due to my Golf TDI experience a Passat TDI will be my next car purchase in the next two or three years.
