            I bought the Fuji Finepix "refurbished" on Ubid for $149.  I wanted to see how a digital camera stacked up against regular 35 mm point and shoot cameras.

I took the Fuji, plus an Olympus 35 mm camera, and a JVC camcorder on vacation to Mexico recently.  About 85% of the time I used the Fuji digital camera.  I outfitted the Fuji camera with a 128 mb "smart card" which allows the camera to take 300+ pictures on the "normal" resolution setting.  If set on "fine" resolution about 150 pictures can be taken.  The camera came with a 16 mb card that allowed only a dozen or so pictures.  The 128 mb card can be purchased at Costco for about $59, and it slides right into a slot on the side of the camera.  It's kind of like film.  When the card is "full" you can slide it out and put in another.

After sliding open the cover, it is necessary to turn the switch to the "on" position and wait until the small light near the viewfinder turns green. This takes about 5 seconds, then you're ready to shoot.

After a shot is taken the camera beeps, then it takes about 3 seconds until the light becomes green again and you can shoot again. Speed is the biggest difference between a digital and a 35 mm camera.  

The Fuji camera allows the option of turning on an LCD color display rather than looking through the viewfinder.  If using this option, the photo you just snapped will be displayed momentarily allowing you to see what you shot.   I liked the viewfinder because it had white cross-hairs allowing the picture to be more easily centered.  

Other reviewers reported the camera quickly drained alkaline batteries, so I bought nickel metal hybrid batteries and a quick charger (Rayovac -- $29 for the charger and $12 for four batteries at Target)which allowed a full day's use with no problem whatsoever. 

The camera allows you to control the flash; has a "red eye" flash; has a macro (allowing extreme close-up shots); and a feature than allows automatic continuous photo shooting.  I did not try that option.  The camera allows you to zoom-in before you shoot and then, after the photo is taken, you can magnify the picture itself, and move left, right, up, or down, within the photo itself.  This versatile feature of the digital camera was something I found to be remarkable. 

The photos can be viewed by connecting the camera to a computer with a USB cable.  Software comes with the camera to view and print the photos.  The "slide show" feature is especially nice -- the pictures are displayed on the computer monitor like a slide show, one after another.  I have seen other cameras that can be hooked up directly to a T.V. to allow a slide show presentation to a room of friends. 

H.P "photosmart" printers have a slot on the side where the smart media card can be inserted and color prints made without a computer.  I've tried this and it works fine.  I've printed out pictures using photopaper and the quality is good but not as sharp as a 35 mm photo.  The Fuji 2400 is 2.1 megapixels, and I assume the higher megapixel cameras can deliver a sharper picture.  Still it is nice to be able to print out what I want, when I want.

I've heard it is possible to download digital photos to the websites of companies that will print out your pictures and mail them to you, eliminating the hassle of doing so yourself.  I have no idea how much those companies charge.

This was my first foray into digital picture taking and I am extremely satisfied with the camera.  In the future I expect I will try the higher-end digital camera, when finances allow, but for now the Fuji Finepix 2400 fits the bill to a "T."

 function and once the p of the camera.  Also after the photo has been taken the camera allows digital close-up zooming within the picture itself.  For example if there is an object in the picture you want to get a closer look at you can zoom in and re-center the picture

There is a "macro" feature which allows you to take pictures up close -- less than 12" away, and
