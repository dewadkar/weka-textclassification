            I had to write and let you all know what a happy camper I am.  My Nissan truck, a 2000 SE V6 Desert Runner with automatic has been one of the best investments I have ever made in an automobile.  With just over 14,000 mile and one year old I have only had one visit to the shop, and that was a minor service recall. The fit and finish are outstanding and it drives and handle extremely well for a truck.  The gas mileage is not bad for a V6, 19 - 23 MPG.
If you are a home owner such as I and are always doing weekend projects and you think you need a truck the Frontier can more than do any task that needs to be done around the house.  The deciding factor for me over the F-150 was I could drive circles around that larger truck with my Nissan, also the parking and turning radius is better.  It's just more fun to drive that those huge trucks.
I would highly recommend this truck to anyone.<br><br>
