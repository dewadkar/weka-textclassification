            Following the excellent article published by Brian Igo, I think I can help as I actually drove a burgundy GTB/4 some time ago.
I had never driven a Ferrari V12 before, and I was really eager to try this. It was a friend of mine who gave me this unique opportunity.
Once inside, the view above the immense nose disappears early, due to the curvature, and the screen and windows are lightly small, so with the almost non existent rear quarter view, parking is not its forte. The driving position is good, but the steering effort at slow speeds is very high, as well as the gear lever action. It has the now traditional slotted grille, but I think the 275 series were the first road-going Ferraris to ever have it. The throws between each gear are short and positive, but the springs are twice as strong than in a 308, for that matter. It is not a quick gearbox, it remind me strongly the rear mounted unit found on Alfettas and GTVs.
The 3.2 liter V12 sounds great, like the period P3/P4s at LeMans. At slow rpm one needs to use the throttle with care, because if there is too many gas it tends to stall, at least under 2000 rpm. It is not at home in modern traffic conditions because the visibility or the clutch/gearbox heaviness.
But once on the open road....the gearbox lightens some and the steering too, but this remains a little vague. The engine note transforms by itself the scenery surrounding, and the grip of the Michelin XWX is easy surpassed with a little of gas. However, this is not a nimble sportscar, and the bulk of the car is always present when you steer for a bend. It behaves impeccably in fast turns, but as the road slows down the nose pushes out more than desired. The brakes were incredible powerful compared with a period American Supercar, but today is preferable to anticipate the braking point in order not to overheat the system. The wheels are only 14" and then the disc/pads sizes are not enough to resist the fade if hard used.
But we are not competing, and with that in mind the car is very enjoyable. 
The fact more impressed me of the car it happened by luck. I was shifting at 7000, thrilled by the noise, trying to master the double declutching, powersliding a little out of the slow bends, but I remember to think that the sensations of power and speed were no superior to those of my daily driven 635 CSi. 
Once, in second gear out of a bend, I was attending to the steering wheel enough to miss my 7000 mark. Suddenly, a surge more common in a turbo engine gave me to 8000 and a quick change to third, and, boy, what a push in my back! So then the engine was "in-cam" in the 7000-8000 range, and this transforms the car completely. The straight after that bend became Hunadieres, and my respect for the car and its performance grew for ever.
Maybe its not as racy as a 250 GT SWB, and not as fast in straight line as a Daytona, but its semi-GTO profile worth its money, and the sound and performance of its engine is terrifying.
