            <i>I purchased my 1993 Corolla in the Spring of 1997.  It had 58,000 miles on it at that time.  It now has 110,000 miles.  Four door, 1.8 engine (larger than 1.6 which was standard in 1993), 5 speed manual.</i>

1. <b>Solid Fuel Economy- A+:</b> Without the A/C on, this car gets about 28 MPG in the city, and roughly 33 on the highway.  With the A/C on, about 5 MPG lower for both city and highway.  Easy on the pocketbook in this regard versus most vehicles, and also easy on the environment, which I find appealing.

2.  <b>Reliability - A+:</b>  In roughly four years of ownership, the only significant repair was the replacement of the starter motor.  For me, the Toyota brand has really lived up to its reputation for reliability.  The engine uses only a little oil (roughly a quart every 1,500 miles, which is not bad at all for an engine with 110,000 on the odometer).    

3.  <b> City Driving - A: </b>  The Dallas area has moron filled freeways.  My Corolla's nimble handling and solid brakes have saved me from several accidents.  Also, this car has much less of a blind spot than any car I have ever owned - this is something that a daily freeway commuter like myself very much appreciates.

4.  <b> Highway Driving - C+: </b> On a smooth, newish highway with no side wind, travel at 70 MPH is silky smooth and solid.  But if the road surface is rough, a little uneven, and/or there is a side wind of more than 10 or 15 MPH, the handling often feels a little jittery and less than 100% certain.  If there's a modest gusty wind and it's also wet, two hands on the wheel are a must, and speeds in excess of 65 MPH are just plain unsafe.  In any conditions, passenger compartment noise becomes marked and more than a little annoying above 60 MPH.  

5.  <b> Looks - B+: </b> Yeah, this is a personal thing that you have to judge for yourself, but I'll throw my 2 cents in anyway.  You won't impress the hot rod set, but I think the look of the car is tasteful and modern.  Eight years after it rolled off the assembly line, it does not look dated.

6.  <b> Passenger Compartment - B+: </b> The seats are firm and give generally good support, which I like.  Those as tall as 6'3" can easily be comfortable in the front seat.  The rear seat, however, will feel cramped to anyone over 5'11".  There is an ample glove box and good-sized door storage compartments built into the front doors, and also an intelligently laid out console area (including a covered storage box) between the front seats.

7.  <b> Climate Control - A+: </b>  Superb heating and air conditioning.  More than enough A/C oomph to stay cool even in 110F Texas heat.

8.  <b> Engine Power - B: </b>  I knew I wasn't getting a sports car.  But with a 16 valve, 1.8 engine coupled with a 5 speed, I expected better acceleration.  Bottom-line, the engine is sufficient, but nothing more.  The basic engine for the 1993 model year was a less powerful 1.6.  My experience with the 1.8 makes me recommend that buyers avoid Corollas equipped with the 1.6.

9.  <b> My "Blown Tire" Anecdote: </b>  I had a rear tire blow out on me at 60 MPH.  The car continued to handle beautifully.  You could tell from the noise and rear end vibration that the tire had blown, but I never felt that the car was anything but steady and in complete control.  I was in bumper to bumper freeway traffic and nothing bad happened.  I was able to get off the freeway at the next exit and change to tire without incident.  Nice engineering, Toyota. 

10.  <b> Overall - B+: </b>  A good solid car.  Superb reliability.  An especially nice match for those who will spend the majority of their time driving within city limits and transporting less than a full load of adults.  But honestly, if your going to drive on the highway all the time with a full load of adults, you should probably be looking at a larger size class of car, anyway.
