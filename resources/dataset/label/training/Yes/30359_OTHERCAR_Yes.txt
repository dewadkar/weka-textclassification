            I sold my 1989 Subaru Justy because of the birth of my son in 1991. Biggest mistake I ever made!

The Justy ran smoothly when started, I never had any problems in the winter. For a front wheel drive car, it got around great! Rarely were we ever stuck. 
I liked that it was a small car, built for shorter people. 

Maintenance was a breeze! The only real problem I had was the battery corroded which caused it to die easily. However, that was an easy fix! I put very little money into this car. It was well built.

The only problem I found is the Justy has an Uni-body. Meaning if you smack into something there are little chance, the car can be fixed to even close to new. My husband somehow hit a snow-covered log one winter and the poor car was never the same. It always pulled to the right. 

When my son came along, we did have to upgrade to a 4-door car (which was a huge mistake), as getting in and out of the backseats (getting a child in a car seat) was a huge task� 

The Mercury Topaz I bought when I sold the Justy had problems from almost day one. Unfortunately, because it was a used car I couldn't take it back to the dealer� 

We are back to driving a Subaru station wagon and we love it!
