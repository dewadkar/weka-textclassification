            If any of you have read any of my other epinions, you would know that the 1986 Celica I used to drive had a big DEATH stamp on it since the day I first sat in the driver's seat. What a incredible piece of horse crap that car was. We all knew that it would be passing on sooner or later, and eventually it did. People cried, chicks laughed, I weeped.

So, naturally, the next car I wanted to buy (I had to buy a used one since I have zero deniro), I did not want to be a piece of crap. As a 19 year old college student packed full of testosterone, I was tired of people pulling up next to me and revving their engines while my food processor powered Celica stalled on the line.

Armed with about $3000, I started to look through the local newspaper classifieds and on the internet for a new car. I was getting frustrated over the next week, finding only Toyota Corollas with 569 million miles on them. My dad comes home one day and says that a guy he works with is selling a car, and that it was a 91' Eclipse GSX. That night I went online and looked up the specs on the car,  saw that it was turbo charged and had a dual overhead cam and came stock with 196 horses. This was just what I was looking for.

To make a long story short, I bought the car, put in an intake, filter, and exaust, as well as a boost controller so I could take full command over the turbo. The car now is pushing around 250hp, and absolutly FLIES. I've taken all kinds of cars off the line, from Corvettes, to idiots in CRX's with mufflers.

This car handles great. I'm currently running on 16" Cooper tires, a little wider than the stock tires that come with this car, which make it handle exceptionally well. It's very very ultra quick and is a blast to drive. With 97,000 miles on it, it runs like the day it rolled off the assembly line. The manual tranny in this puppy shifts like butter.

The stock sound system in this car sounds really good too. I put my Pioneer head unit into it and it breathed new life into the old speakers.

On the con side of things, there is not that much room in the back seats, and the car eats gas. However, there is a lot of room in the hatchback trunk. I've moved my bike across town several times in the back of this puppy. Since the backseats fold down, there's also plenty of room if you want to put in a system or anything.

The trick with turbocharged engines, like the ones in the GSX are to let them cool off a minute to a minute and a half after you are done driving it. You also don't want to run the engine at high revs immediatly starting the car. Oil changes are very very important in turbo engine cars too, the turbocharger EATS oil like a 560 pound obese gorilla. Make sure you change the oil at LEAST every 3,000 miles. I always change mine at 2,500 just to be safe. This car runs good on anything except regular gas. 

If you put in your own boost controller for the turbo, which I highly reccomend, you should also make sure to get a seperate gauge that will mount on your door rail. You'll find out that the stock turbo gauge sucks.

You wanna throw somewhere between 91 and 94 octane in this puppy for good performance. I reccomend Sunoco's Ultra 94. That's what I use.

This car also comes with cruise control (which I still have not figured out how to use), a sun roof, and anti-lock brakes standard. I also set off the alarm 4 to 5 times daily. I would read the instruction manual to find out what I'm doing wrong, but then again I'm a guy.

I've only had this car for a couple months now, but it has not been a problem at all. I look forward to giving it a paint job and souping it up a little more. It's a good handling, a** hauling, quick moving gas eater, but I reccomend it.
