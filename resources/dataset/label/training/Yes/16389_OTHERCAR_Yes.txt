            This is the perfect camera.  Large as a cake of soap and virtually so strong you could back over it with your car.  Razor sharp photos with no fish eye at top zoom range.  Average flash (11 ft.), only 2.8 zoom but fast to open and zoom.  Great for those quick shots.  

Strange to use at first but fun with flashing lights and sound.  You get some strange looks when you use this thing if you forget to turn the sound off.  

If your spouse is easily confused with gadgets buy them another camera.  Every setting can be changed and changes are saved so each time you don't have to re-enter them.  Video is wonderful and when memory prices come down you can do 30 fps SVGA in QuickTime and it looks better than an digital camcorder.  Good low light performance.  Uses rechargable battery but not AAA or AA batteries.  Lasts for 200+ photos. Doesn't have the richer photo colors at default setting that Kodaks have. The camera tells it like it is.  Your settings are still there when you turn the camera on.      

Viewfinder is like looking in a matchbox with 2 holes cut in the ends.  Screen can be seen in the daylight.  Comes with complete 4 cables.  Easy to review photos and zoom in to see faces etc.  You aren't forced to go one direction and then press a couple button to go the other.  Joystick like controls.  

Can be used as a PC camera.  Software is lousy and won't remove red eye.  Camera downloads on plug in to XP but doesn't with Windows ME or 2000.  Hard to figure out for some people.  I am spoiled by others.
