            After my 1986 Chevy Celebrity bit the dust awhile back, it was time to start looking.  What did I look for in my next car?  It had to look good, drive well, and cost under $5,000.  That's why I chose a 1994 Sunbird, with 59,000 miles for $4,800.

What I love about my Sunbird:
--Very sleek style, my 2-door coupe looks pimpin' with the spoiler on back and tinted windows.
--Cheap, only $4,800.
--With a 2.0, 4-cylinder engine, this baby doesn't guzzle gas.
--Handles great, can take any corner.

What I hate about the Sunbird:
--No power, don't expect to win any races in this car.
--There is just not a lot of room in the back.
--The dash speakers are 3.5 in, the smallest size they make!  Look for your bass in the back with the 6x9's.

All in all, the Sunbird is big on looks, but nothing to back it up under the hood.  I have had my Sunbird for a couple months and it runs beautifully.  This car is definitely a perfect first or second car for a teen like me.
