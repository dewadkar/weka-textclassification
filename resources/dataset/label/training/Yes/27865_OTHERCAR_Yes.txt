            Needing a good used car after my old Accord died, I purchased a 1995 deep green, 4 door Dodge Spirit.  The deciding factors were price and condition.  Although purchased from a car lot, it was immaculate.  Whoever had owned it was a fanatic about it's condition.  If it could be polished, it was polished, every nick and chip had been touched up!.  The car is a V6 automatic with very attractive factory custom wheels.  

With the V6 the car really performs!.  Unless the car next to me is a performance car (and a good one), it's in the mirror when I put my foot down (along with a bunch of tire smoke).  Gas milage is decent at 25-27, everything works and nothing has required more than routine maintenance so far.  The valve cover gaskets will need replacing soon and the power steering pump has a small leak, nothing serious.

I decided on the Dodge since I had previously owned a 1986 Plymouth K car that I gave to my Daughter after I had put 175000 miles on it.  It's now up to 223000 miles. She still has it and it still runs well, requiring nothing more than a head gasket and normal maintenance in it's entire life.  

The mechanic who checked the car prior to purchase commented that the reliability was very good on these cars and that most or all of the old K-car bugs had been killed by 1995.
