            All my life i wanted a sports car.  I can remember sitting on the street corner watching the 'knight riders' drive by.  After a decade of owning subpar vehicles, from my first 1985 Buick  to the 85 Ford Ranger, i never thought i would own a van.

<b>Then the Pickup starts having problems</b>.  This is not something that i found amusing as i deliver pizza part time to fill in the bill payments.  In fact, my employer depends on my driving as he signs the pay on the other position i hold with his company.

I had a problem, i could not now drive for him dependably.

He had a problem, he had too many vehicles, the Van was in storage, and used only once or twice a week for large school orders.

Solution, and we bartered a deal, and i began making the payments to him monthly for this van.

Power, plenty, i have never needed more when i might need it, for a 6 Cylinder it goes plenty fast, and many times i have caught myself doing over 140Km/h in a 80 zone. (oops) Mind you, that is what occurs when you go from a beat-up pickup, that can barely manage 70 with the petal down to the floor.

At this point, i have now had this Van for a year and a half, i estimate i have roughly 2 - 2 1/2 years til its paid off.  Am i glad i did it? Certainly,  Would i do it again? On your life!

However, the so called 5 star service from GMC is just nothing more then a way for them to soak you for more money, they charge exhorbitant shop rates, and now that i am out of warranty (it was at 50 thousand when i got it, its now at 110 Thousand Kilometre's), there is no reason to suffer the fees.

With some minor exceptions, this has been a awesome Van, dependable and had never let me down.
Concerns i have are with a intermitent windshield wiper problem (they like to stick in the extended position once in a while when you turn them off), as well as a couple new tricks its learned.

The driver could only put the passenger window down, not up.   However that seems to have fixed itself a month or so after it began, but not after some minor problems with the passenger not being able to close the window.   Also the door locks, on occassion, they decide to take a break and not listen to my gentle POUNDING.  BUT i was lucky enough to have the remote door lock's so i just used it after getting frustrated (which of course, it would work fine after doing so...)

Would i suggest this one? Whole heartedly <b>YES</b>
But do mind my concerns, i am expecting some electrical work in the near future due to the outlined problems.

The stereo is clear, and fairly easy to manipulate while driving.

One other thing of note:  I am a rather large man, and find some vehicles, even large ones hard to get in and out of, this one has had nary a problem in that department, though i do dislike the bucket seats.  The tilt steering wheel is a blessing except when the wife leaves it all the way down. ;)

If you've existed on 15 year old cars for the last 10 years, i suggest you find yourself a nice 1998 Chev Venture, and drool over it.

July 4th, 2001.

I recently traveled from my hometown, (45 minutes north of Toronto Ontario) to Brandon Manitoba with this vehical.  Highway mileage seems to have increased by about as much as a extra 150-225 Km per tank.

The Round Trip was a total of some 4500 Kilometers, and if you live anywhere along the 'Trans-Canada Highway' You may have seen us traveling. (A white van with Neon Orange splashed all over it with 'Pizza Pizza'  also on both sides, front and back. (We got some strange looks) ;)

Keeping in mind that i am a large person, the seats in this van are hard on the 'bum' after extended drives, and previous to this trip the longest trip was approximately 1 hour with 15 minute breaks minumum.

The rear seats slid back into a more reclined position, making it easier to sleep, and although it did not give lots of quality sleep, it was suffecient to maintain our ourlined schedule.  However, next time (if there is EVER another trip like this) I will remember to bring something along to place over the seatbelts and the small levers that allow the seats to be adjusted in their vertical position.

My decision is unchanged, this is a excellent van, and rates extremely high for value.

I kept my receipts from each fuel stop, and kept track of kilometres traveled before each fuel-up.  In the next little while i plan to summarize this infomation here.

But basically it totals something like this.

Fuel Cost: $350.00 CDN
Distance travelled:  4400 Kilometres.

I Still love this van, even with its personality traits.
