            Since the current-generation 3-Series appeared in 1999 I&#146ve had trouble getting excited about it despite many opportunities to drive the car. Even after the driver-oriented engine and suspension tweaks a couple years ago, it always seemed smoother and less visceral than I felt a BMW should be. I wanted to have fun, but the car was pursuing technical excellence. Fun and technical excellence are not the same thing.

I&#146ve written quite a bit about my mixed emotions towards the 3-Series before. For this review I&#146ll concentrate on my recent impressions driving a manual 325 coupe at one recent BMW event and an automatic 325 wagon at another. I also describe my experience driving an automatic 330 sedan at a BMW-sponsored driving course <b><a href="/content_118801731204">here</a></b>. That review also discusses a couple of new performance-oriented options for 2004, the SMG transmission and 330-only &#147Performance Package.&#148 In its sixth model year, this is now the oldest car in the class. How&#146s it holding up?

<b>Styling and Accommodations</b>

I&#146ve never found the current 3-Series sedan and wagon strikingly attractive. (The coupe and convertible benefit from more rakish proportions.) They&#146re certainly well-proportioned and handsome in a very conventional manner, but rely on large wheels to convey the &#147driving machine&#148 message. A bit more edge would be nice. Just don&#146t do anything crazy, Mr. Bangle. If the improvement of the 2004 5-Series over the 2002 7-Series is any indication, BMW&#146s chief designer will manage to produce a design that is both striking and attractive for the next 3, due in two years. Whether the result will age as well as the current car is more dubious.

Inside the 3 is also very conventional. With the center stack canted much less towards the driver than earlier BMWs, very little about the interior says &#147driver&#146s car&#148 to me. Luxury receives much more emphasis than sport. This is clearly an interior conceived before all of the recent trends towards novel textures and shapes. Again, if the improvement of the new 5&#146s interior over those in the old one and the 7 is any indication, the next 3 will do just fine here. At present, however, the Audi A4 offers a higher class interior while those in the Cadillac CTS, Infiniti G35, Lexus IS 300, and even the Saab 9-3 have more character, if decidedly inferior materials. The new Acura TL&#146s interior is styled somewhat like the BMW&#146s, but manages to feel more up-to-date and sportier. When I think about it, none of the cars in this segment offers a striking, high-quality, interior designed expressly for the enthusiast. So the path is wide open for the next 3.

I remain less than happy with the 3&#146s driving position. The instrument panel and steering column are simply too high. Even after raising the seat an inch or so, something I don&#146t do in most cars, the window sills still feel too high around me, especially in the area where the door meets the dash. The new 5 does much better in this area. Again hopefully the new 3 will follow. For now I prefer the airier cockpits of the Japanese competition.

I have always felt that the 3-Series&#146 back seat is roomier than most people seem to realize. The old 5 actually provided a fraction of an inch less rear leg room. The new 5 has a roomier rear seat, making the more expensive car easier to justify. That said, the 3 in sedan and wagon forms provides adequate room and comfort for a pair of adults in back. The coupe and convertible contain more marginal rear seats, but I still wouldn&#146t mind spending an hour or two in either.

The trunk is the 3 is a bit tight but usefully shaped. Folding rear seats remain an option on sedans (they are standard on coupes and wagons). Let me again wonder why they cost almost $500 here but are standard in the cheapest Hyundai. The cargo area in the wagon is also among the tightest in this class&#151a VW Jetta wagon offers almost twice as much cargo volume. But how much cargo do you plan to haul, anyway? For even large hauls from the grocery store the 3 wagon is easily up to the task. I should know since my new car, a Mazda Protege5, has an even smaller cargo area yet it has proven adequate even for some good-sized hauls from CostCo.

<b>On the Road</b>

I&#146ve said it before and I&#146ll say it again: When paired with the manual the 184-horsepower 2.5-liter inline six provides plenty of power for this car. My personal philosophy with a manual transmission is you want to have enough power that the car never feels slow, but not so much that charging hard through the gears readily launches you into license-threatening territory. The 2.5 fits the bill. The 3.0 has a torquier feel and is significantly quicker, but I personally would not spend the extra $5,000-plus to get it with the manual. If you want the wagon, then the 3.0 isn&#146t offered anyway.

For 2004 the 3.0-liter manual gains a sixth ratio. I have not sampled this transmission, so I cannot comment on it. The 2.5 retains the old five-speed. It shifts easily enough, with low effort and a pleasantly mechanical feel. That said, throws could be shorter, and I personally wouldn&#146t mind a little more effort.

With a five-speed automatic transmission you must rely on sheer thrust for thrills, so with this option the 3.0-liter makes more sense. Still, even with the automatic (and in wagon form no less, which adds a couple hundred pounds) the 2.5 does not feel lethargic. It doesn&#146t provide the grins the 3.0 does, but I found it more than acceptably quick. BMW knows how to gear a transmission to get the most out of a relatively small engine.

I have not driven the SMG yet. Since it&#146s more manual than automatic, the 2.5 may be more than sufficient with it as well.

Either engine is very smooth&#151inline sixes are inherently smoother than V6s&#151and since the revisions a couple of years ago they both sound very nice&#151especially the 3.0 I must admit. 

Somehow I have yet to drive an all-wheel-drive 3-Series. All-wheel-drive is a $1,750 option on the sedans and wagons. If you drive often in the rain or snow it is likely the way to go. BMW has tuned the system to send most torque in normal conditions to the rear, so I would not expect it to substantially change the car&#146s driving feel.

In years past I&#146ve criticized the 3&#146s steering for feeling to slow and light. I wanted a system more like that in the Z3. The reasons for the difference likely include designing the 3 for driving on Germany&#146s autobahn. At high speeds you want slow steering lest a momentary twitch send you into the next lane. Problem is, here in the States we can&#146t legally drive such speeds. 

Apparently I&#146m not the only one who has been asking for quicker steering at low speeds. The Sport Package of the 2004 5-Series includes what BMW calls &#147Active Steering,&#148 which uses a planetary gearset in the steering column to vary the steering ratio based on vehicle speed. I have not driven a 5 with this system yet, but it sounds like exactly what I&#146ve been asking for. I suspect it will also be offered in the next-generation 3-Series, due in a couple of years.

Getting back to the current system, satisfaction with it could be dependent on one&#146s reference point. During earlier test drives I&#146ve often compared it to the steering in the Z3 or other such cars. This time around I drove a 325Ci coupe immediately after driving a 745i. Suddenly the steering in the 3 felt much tighter and direct than I recalled. Maybe they revised it, but I suspect it was simply the contrast with the 7&#146s softer, more relaxed steering feel. Whatever the reason, I liked this 3&#146s steering better than any of the current generation I&#146ve driven to date.

The chassis is extremely well balanced, and can be precisely placed with both the steering and throttle. (The Infiniti G35 needs to study this car on the latter.) After driving the 7, the 3 felt especially agile. The wagon feels a bit less inclined to change directions, but the difference is not substantial. Even with the sport package, the ride is composed on just about any surface. BMW is the master at tuning a suspension to excel at both ride and handling. Noise levels are not as low as in the larger, more expensive 5-series, but are still quite low for this size car. 

For 2004 the $800 xenon lamps swivel to point the way when the car turns. I did not drive the 3 at night, so I cannot comment on the usefulness of this feature. Judging from the limited visibility when turning in my new Protege5, I&#146m going to have to say it&#146s probably pretty useful. On the other hand, the &#147cornering lamps&#148 in my wife&#146s Olds Intrigue do a fairly good job in this regard, and they&#146re a much less expensive solution. Cornering lamps, which light up the area to the side of the car in turns, used to be a common feature in American cars, but never seemed to have caught on overseas.

<b>Pricing</b>

The 3-Series ranks with the Mercedes C-Class as the most expensive car in its class. (The baby Jag is priced about as high, but heavy discounting and incentives take it out of the running for this &#147prize.&#148) If you want technical excellence, you have to pay for it&#151in the mid-to-high 30s for a decently-equipped 325. (Fully loaded even the 325 clears 40.) An Audi A4 is a bit less expensive, but I found it an even more antiseptic driving experience under normal conditions. Maybe it also comes alive on the track? I wouldn&#146t count so much on it. The Audi has a nicer interior but is slower and, with sport suspension, rides more harshly while still not handling as well. 

For a much more powerful yet less expensive car check out the Infiniti G35. The G35 is in some ways a more entertaining if less technically excellent car. Its interior is significantly lower in quality. The new Acura TL, priced like the G35 in the low 30s, has a better driving position and design (to my eye), and a sweet V6, but cannot touch the above cars in handling. A better match for the 325 is the Acura TSX. Based on the European Accord, it has a 200-horsepower 2.4-liter four. The TSX&#146s handling ability and feel are much closer than the TL&#146s to the 3-Series. At $27,000, it is much less expensive than the other cars mentioned here. The all-but-forgotten Lexus IS 300 is the opposite of the TL: it pairs agile handling with a tight, cheap-looking, even tacky interior. A Saab 9-3 Aero is priced like the Japanese (after rebates), but offers more precise handling together with good ride quality. Its interior quality is below the Germans, a touch below the Acuras, and above the G35. 

All in all, the 325's price reflects every bit of its excellence, and then some. I would personally have trouble paying such a high price for a compact car, even though the 3 depreciates at a lower than average rate. But if you must have the best all-around compact, then cash in those mutual funds and pay up.

Update: Kenikov points out in a comment that one can get a 325i for under $30,000. This is true if you get little beyond the basic car, which isn't such a bad idea. Get the sedan; skip the sunroof; skip the leather (the standard vinyl feels almost like medium-grade leather, requires less maintenance, and lasts longer; German engineers feel every car should come with the stuff); skip the power seats; get white, black, or red paint; and you'll end up around 28 after what Edmunds suggests is the typical, not very large dealer discount. Add the Sport and Cold Weather Packages and the total should just barely clear thirty. For an enthusiast who is very clear about his or her priorities (i.e. puts a great chassis before such amenities) this might not be a bad way to go. The hard part is that a G35 with these things costs the same amount.

<b>Last Words</b>

In the end there are no perfect cars in this class. The best car depends on your priorities in performance, handling, ride, refinement, interior room, interior quality, and styling. The BMW comes closer than any of the others to excelling on all fronts, but I cannot help wishing it were fitted with a more driver-oriented, more interesting interior, quicker steering, and a more entertaining suspension. Maybe with the next generation.
