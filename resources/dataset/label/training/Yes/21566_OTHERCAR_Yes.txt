            We bought this vehicle for 2 reasons.  First, we were in the process of adopting our daughter and we needed a 4-door family car; and second it had great features my previous car had that I wasn't quite ready to give up yet.  I wish I had known about this site before purchasing this car, and the opinions written here probably would've saved my husband and me a lot of money and grief.  I knew upon purchasing this car that the air conditioner had been replaced after the previous owners had it just 2 years.  (That should've been my first clue that more repairs were to come.)  I am pretty cautious about purchasing used vehicles, so I did my usual research: checked with consumer reporting magazines (which, by the way, said the typical transmission trouble had been rectified!), had my mechanic look it over, and also had the local Dodge dealership run the VIN number to see if any recalls were outstanding and also what repairs had been done.  I want to note that ALL of these checked out fine, so we purchased this car.

At first it was great...I loved the leather interior, the power features, the roominess, and neat digital features.  Things soon changed, however.  We bought the car in April, and I noticed the first weekend I had it that the cruise was slow to respond.  I would be driving 70mph on the interstate and if we went up a hill, the car would slow down almost 10mph before the cruise would kick in and maintain the speed that had been set.  Truthfully, that was more irritating than defective, so I learned to live with it.  Well, our daughter was born in May, and when she was 1 month old, I made a short trip to the grocery store only to find myself stranded on the side of the interstate on a hot summer day at 100 degrees and a tiny baby in the back seat...the water pump just blew up.  (A trucker pulled off when I did and said he saw a burst of water blow out from under my car, so he thought it wouldn't be long until I would be having trouble.  Fortunately, he was a very nice, helpful man.)

After that, it was a matter of time before we were having trouble with the seats and the windows working properly.  When we took it in to have it serviced, we decided to go ahead and change the oil, flush the transmission, and do some other routine maintenance.  About another 2 weeks went by and my transmission started slipping.  When I would put it into reverse it would act just like it was in neutral.  Often when I'd stop and then start again, it would just sit there and then suddenly jolt into gear.  It gave me a sick feeling to think that after $800 in repairs already, we were looking at a new transmission.  Luckily, I have a friend at the local Mercury dealer who said they'd take it off my hands if I'd trade for a 1999 Sable.  We jumped on it!  I only had that Intrepid for 7 months, but after reading the opinions listed here, I am so glad we got rid of that thing.  Oh, and another really strange thing that happened with that car...

We live in a rural area, and one morning after securing my baby in the back seat, I opened the driver's door, sat down, and when I reached for the handle to close the door, there lay a 2-foot black snake on my door handle!  How that thing got into my car (much less my garage) I'll never know, but just the thought that creepy-crawlies could get up into your car with the doors and windows secure is enough for me to say, &quot;That's the straw that'll break the camel's back.&quot;  I've never been so glad to get rid of a car in my life!<br><br>
