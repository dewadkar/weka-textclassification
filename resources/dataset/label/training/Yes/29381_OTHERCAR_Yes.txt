            The Toyota Avalon is by far on of the best Toyota's that are made.  It is one for many reasons, begining with the stereo.  The stereo in the Avalon is one of the best that i have heard, and the bass is great.  Another reason is that the Avalon is the same car as the Lexus but without real wood, however it is far less expensive.  The outside of the car looks great and it looks even better on the inside.  Unlike alot of cars these days the trunk in the Avalon is one of the largest that i have seen.  Also the Avalon was highly rated in most government crash test. The Avalon would be the car of choice for most people looking for a great deal.<br><br>
