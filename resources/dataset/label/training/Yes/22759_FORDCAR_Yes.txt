            I bought my first Explorer because I liked the look and the feel of it, and as a Home Health Nurse I practically live in my truck.  I had also read about the dependability of the Explorer, and knew I could count on it to get me where I needed to go no matter what the weather.  What I didn't know when I bought my Explorer is that it would save my life.  I rolled my Explorer one day while driving to a patient's home. I rounded a tight curve on a dirt road that was improperly grade and rolled the truck twice.  When the dust settled, I gathered my wits and walked to the patient's home.  Later when I saw my Explorer again I was pleased to see that although it was totaled from the rollover, the entire area where driver and passengers sit had remained intact! The roof was scraped but not caved in, and i feel that this prevented me from being seriously injured or killed.  As soon as the insurance company settled with me I went out and bought another Explorer. I've never had any problems with it.. just take it in for regular maintenance, oil changes, and tires. I've got 145,000 miles on it now, and plan to drive it another 145,000.... and then trade it in on another Explorer!<br><br>
