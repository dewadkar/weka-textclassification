            I thought I knew enough about the various options regarding digital cameras to choose something that would suit by immediate needs, without raising the eyebrows of my betrothed "accountant".  The 780c has filled that requirement nicely - I can use it for capturing before-and-after shots of household projects (for posterity, or just bragging rights), taking pictures of items being auctioned online, or simply toting around on vacations to have instant images to send to friends or to keep in addition to our 35mm photo albums.

The camera is a decent weight, not too cumbersome to tote around, and the controls are easy to understand and modify to suit personal tastes (with adjustable picture quality and subject options).  The software for extracting the images is a total no-brainer, and fairly quick, compared to some utilities I've clunked around with in the past.

The best advice I could possibly offer to someone considering this unit would be to invest in an adapter and rechargeable batteries.  The speed at which this camera bleeds though 4 AA's is astounding, three times more so when the flash is involved.  The adapter should be used whenever you have the means, realistically (being in any proximity to an outlet - it's really not such a burden to be "wired to the wall"), and the rechargables should save you a decent chunk of change if you end up using the camera a great deal outdoors, etc.

Additionally, the unit is not exactly jiggle-proof, often losing its short-term settings as a result of what I can only imagine is a slight misfit in the battery housing compartment.  If they lose connection with their contact points even slightly, you'll find you're prompted to set the date, time, picture quality and flash settings on next use...and this can happen often!

Lastly (and this is an issue with most cameras, not just this one) the display screen is very, very, <i>very</i> difficult to view outdoors when the sun is bright, and you'll find yourself squinting into the window under a cupped hand quite often is you want to see if a shot you just took is worth keeping.  Fortunately, with the low cost of 8mb memory cards these days, you could afford to take more "throw-away" shots, and deal with sorting them out properly once you get indoors.

All in all, I don't regret the purchase in the slightest - best of all, finding them on eBay for under $160 is not uncommon!
