            I have owned my 2000 Hyundai Tiburon since new.  With 40,000 miles on it, it has proven to be trouble-free, fun transportation.  It is not the most powerful on the block, but where the Tib really shines is in the handling department.  It's my understanding that Hyundai went to Porsche to get their suspension tuned for the Tiburon, and it shows.  It handles very well in the snow as well.

My only gripe is the placement of the cupholder, which is a bit bizarre.  It slides out from the radio console, so if you use it, you can't get easy access to the stereo controls.

Also, you can't beat the warranty with a stick.  I have found the local Hyundai dealer to stand 100% behind this car, and the roadside assistance that comes with a new Hyundai is actually quite good.  I locked my keys in the car, and called both AAA and Hyundai Roadside Assistance.  The Hyundai people were there long before AAA was even on the way.

Considering how low priced the Hyundai Tiburon is vs. it's competition, and the quality of what you get, I think this car is hands down the best value among small sport coupes.
