            The most surprising purchase of the last 10 years was my purchase of a 1994 Dodge Ram 2500( 3/4 ton) 4x4 pick up with standard cab powered by a 5.9 l Cummins Turbo Diesel.  A six cylinder power house. Compared to other diesel trucks it is not the most powerful but let me tell you about towing, ride, handling, and around town. All around I found myself  Pleasantly surprised at the delivery on all the above topics. I primarily purchased the truck because of my experience on Diesel ships and my education as a Marine Engineer. I know what's going on in a Diesel but I might as well get out  my magic 8 ball to figure out what is going on when I have a problem with an electronic ignition gas engine. But a diesel is simplicity at it's best. Has been for the last 50 years. Diesels are Compression engines. Which means they don't use an ignition system to ignite it's fuel. It uses the piston squeeze to increase the pressure which lowers the ignition temperature of the fuel. Now I know you've heard you have to plug Diesels in  to keep them warm in the winter or they won't start. Well I'm in Maine Today it's -5 Deg. F. out this morning.  These engines and almost all diesels that operate in cold weather have some start aid to help them go during the colder winter months.
The Cummins has a grid air heater in the air intake for the engine. This unit is basically like what you find in an air dryer.  Some Engines ( Ford International has Glow plugs.)
Some have Either start assist. 

    A note on Either starting of diesel engines.
Either is a highly volatile compound that helps lower the ignition point in the cylinders of a diesel engine.
Believe it or not Diesel fuel  or #2 fuel as it is commonly known. Is a fine lubricant. And Diesels look to the fuel to help lubricate during start up before oil has started to be delivered.  Funny thing is Either is also a great degreaser. So what ever oil you had on your cylinder wall is now washed off by the either. Short story is over 20,000 hours or 100,000 miles you've wasted your engine due to wear at start up.


Ok, Some other advantages of a diesel engine. Fuel is consistently cheaper. 
Currently it is the same cost as low test 87 octane gas. But in September it was 20 cents  cheaper than low test. When you fill up a Fuel tank with 30 gallons of Diesel and it's 30 cents cheaper you are talking lots of savings over the year.
(.30 x 30 gal = $9.00 savings on each tank)
Another plus is mileage. I've experienced a constant 23 miles to the gallon. Now if you own a 3/4 ton 4 wheel drive pick up with a big block v8 or new v10 you are not finding average mileage's anywhere near 15 mpg. And that's with a tail wind, A Stroooonnnng!!!! tail wind. 
Towing and Bed capacity are great. Towing 6 tons on a class 5 reese hitch.
As far as bed capacity I put 2 yards of Crushed stone  in the bed and I squashed my suspension about 2&quot;. Not a lot compared to the lift these trucks have off the shelf.
 
The automatic is a little odd at times. Of all the good things the truck has the transmission is the only thing that gives me pause, I think if I'd had the choice on my next truck, which will be a diesel powered truck, I'll get the Standard transmission.
This truck has 100,000 miles on it today and by all accounts it will go another 200,000 with out any major problems.
