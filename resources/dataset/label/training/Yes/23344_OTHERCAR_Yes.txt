            When it comes to sports cars in the price range, nothing seems to compare. I always find my self subconsciously comparing every fast little car I see to my beloved Mazda masterpiece. I find that much of the RX7's draw is in its style, speed, power, and agility. The car's beauty doesn't stop at the outer shell, however, the RX7 is equipped with cockpit style seating and dash, the perfect amount of trunk and back compartment space, great stereo sound, and comfortable bucket seats.
Because of the rarity of the RX7, many of its enthusiasts of car clubs in towns all over the country. These clubs allow owners to get the most out of their vehicle and keep it running in top condition.
Mostly I have nothing but likes for the car. I'd say that my favorite aspects of it are the speed, handling, and absolutely the looks. I think its a beautiful car. I won't lie, there are a few disadvantages that come with owning any sports car like this one, but they are far outweighed by the Advantages. For example though, if you're looking for a canyon's worth of trunk space, this isn't the vehicle for you, nor is any sports car. But compared to other cars like it, it does have quite a bit. Another problem some might have with the RX7 is a problem seen by many who own a foreign, discontinued car. If you're met with any quasi serious problems, it's a bit harder to fix and find parts for than your average Chevy or Ford. Fear not, however, most Mazda dealerships or exotic car specialists are happy to cater to your needs.
I would recommend this car to anyone from a regular teenager to mid-life crisis sufferer, or for that matter, anyone who can appreciate fine craftsmanship and raw power. My brother got an RX7 as his first real car after my parents had given him a practice car first for a couple of months. He loved it more than anything in the world. Honest truth be told, I am yet to meet an RX7 owner or even anyone who has ever seen or driven one that doesn't adore it.<br><br>
