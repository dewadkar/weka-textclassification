            Although some of the latest digital cameras are small enough to fit in your shirt pocket, but I won't surprise if their prices may bore a hole through it.  You won't need to worry about this for this Nikon's Coolpix 950.  I find it pretty satisfying for it to deliver beautiful, ultrahigh resolution images with an reasonable price-tag.

This Nikon's Coolpix feature 2-megapixel resolution, and if you don't already know, that mean you can capture photographs of up to 1600 by 1200 resolution.  And its a pretty impressive number when you translates it to 1.92 million pixels.  This model produces handsome pictures, even in huge 11 by 14 inch prints, and I find out that the image quality comes out to be quite superior than many other digital cameras I knew.

This camera comes with a basic optical viewfinder, 3X optical zoom lens which can be rotate so you can take photos at various angles.  It also got a manual mode for controlling settings such as white blance.  In addition, it lets you attach an optional wide-angle or fisheye lens for captureing 180 degree pictures of large buildings or a group of people.

With Nikon's 2 inch screen, I can easily view single images or tiny but distinct thumbnails of multiple shots, so I can delete the ones I don't like and save precious storage space.  With standard settings, I can use the camera up to 2 hours with a standard AA batteries.  But you should expect shorter battery life if you use the LCD often, especially for viewing high resolution photos.  

The Nikon's 8MB CompactFlash card hold 8 uncompressed photos captured at 1600 by 1200 resolution, or up to 199 compressed 640 by 480 images.  I can transfer images to my PC's hard disk via serial cable, but that process takes a while when I am downloading more than a couple of photos, especially hi-resolution shots.  

Overall, for the best looking, most vibrant pictures and easy to use controls, the Nikon's Coolpix 950 is your best bet!<br><br>
