            The 2000 Boxster is a 2-door, 2-passenger convertible or coupe available in two trims, the Convertible and S. Base prices are around $41,430 and $49,930 for the Convertible and S, respectively. My friend's father, who just retired, recently bought one for about $45,250.  He got the 6- Speed Manual transmission and it is the sweetest thing I have saw and the sweeteest ride I have ever been in! The Boxster's closest competitors include the Mercedes-Benz SLK 230 Kompressor, Chevrolet Corvette Convertible and the BMW M3 Convertible. The Convertible is equipped with a standard 2.7-liter, H6, 217-horsepower engine that consumes 20-mpg in the city and 28-mpg on the highway. A 5-speed manual transmission with overdrive is standard, while a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission with overdrive is optional. The S is equipped with a standard 3.2-liter, H6, 250-horsepower engine that consumes 18-mpg in the city and 26-mpg on the highway. A 6-speed manual transmission with overdrive is standard, while a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission with overdrive is optional. The 2000 Boxster Convertible is a carryover from 1999, while the S is all-new. New standard features include an electronic throttle, soft-tough grain for the trim and instrument panel and added exterior colors. If you have the m0ney for a sporty car and want something luxury and fast... this is the car for you!
