            I bought this vehicle in the fall of 1999, because I totaled my other one that spring. I picked the Cutlass Supreme, cause since I'm 6'8&quot; it has a good amount of leg room in the drivers seat.
I love this vehicle, cause of it's look and styling, it's supposively one of the best interiors that Oldsmobile has ever made, and I believe it. My mom has an Alero and the interior has no leg room, and the arm rests are really hard.
It's overall a good car, the Gas Mileage could be a little better, but other than that its nice. This car really appeals to teenagers, cause of the sporty look. It's ran along the same GM lines as the Buick Regal and the Pontiac Grand Prix.<br><br>
