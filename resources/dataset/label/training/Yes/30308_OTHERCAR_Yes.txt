            My dogs love that Trooper.  At last count there was one grown litter of eight Newfie-mix, the parents, the newest adoptee and two pigs that have trucked around in my 1990 Trooper ll LS.  And this isn�t a eulogy either.  The Trooper is alive and doing well, thank you.  It has, however, lost that new car smell and taken on a whole 'nother fragrance......

She now has a wee bit over 140K miles and runs loudly, but great.   The loud is due to a crack of the manifold pipes.  I still have the original exhaust.   I like to think of it as &quot;tuned&quot;.  But the engine is tight. Burns no oil and is sure to go another 100k..  The manual transmission is also well, as is the clutch.  The problems with my Trooper almost all had to do with the flat design of the windshield.   Any missile that was hurtled at the glass generally resulted in a crack that warranted the windshield being replaced.  I think at last count I have been through close to ten replacements. It just seems like a matter of physics as there is no parabola to the glassd design.

The ride is obviously not luxurious.  Its ok.  Seats are ok.  And the radio is ok.  I�ve done some five hour jaunts but I wouldn�t want to do them on a regular basis.

As I said with all those hounds you can bet there�s plenty of room in the unit, especially with the rear seat down.  I�ve moved twice with the Trooper, each time amazed at how much &quot;stuff&quot; I cram in the back.  Sadly, I think the body is showing the results of an inferior grade of steel.  There�s way to much rust on the truck.  But after ten plus years near the shores of the Atlantic here on Long Island, I guess its not that bad...

 This truck has been real good to me.   It does well in the snow with the four-wheel drive engaged and handles well on dry pavement despite the high center of gravity.  True, I�m still chiseling pupkus (that�s the dried dog drool from dogs) off the windows.   When I�m done, I think I�ll drive her over to the Isuzu dealer and see what he can do for me on a new 2000 Trooper,
