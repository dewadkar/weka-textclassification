            We recently purchased a brand new Mitsubishi Galant 99 from the dealer.  I have two words for it; THE BEST.  Not only does it have power steering it also has anti lock breaks and power windows.  Who cares about airbags when you have plush seats to sit on, but it still comes with them.  I love the spacious seating.  Compared to the previous car I had, the Chevy Camero, I now can lean back and enjoy the ride, not get cramped up.  And did you see the sticker on this baby, under $20,000!  That's a deal!  So far we only had to visit the mechanic once! The mechanic fixed the problem right away, and we got the car back the next day!  The only bad thing is the CD play.  It dosen't come standard.  It also doesn't have an alarm system, so you will be left with spending more to protect your newly purchased vehicle.<br><br>
