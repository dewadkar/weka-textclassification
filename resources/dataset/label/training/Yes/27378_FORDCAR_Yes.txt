            This is my dream vehicle ! I owned an SUV but I often needed a pickup to haul things. I have two small children so pickups were generally out of the question for easy entry into car seats. When I saw the Supercrew I fell in love with it. It drives like a car with the extra luxury of being higher off the road. It is roomy and luxurious inside (I have the Lariat with 60/40 bench seat). I just took it on vacation and found it extremely comfortable in both the back seat (between two carseats) and in the front driver seat during an 11 hour trip. The pickup bed is fine for most uses, sometimes you need to drop the tailgate to haul long loads such as lumber. I recommend tubular running boards since the truck is a bit tall to get in easy. I also recommend a Roll-N-Lock tonneau cover if you need to occasionally need to haul smaller items and luggage that need to be locked up, it still allows you to haul taller cargo when locking is not required. I got the 5.4l V-8 with trailer towing package and found it had more than enough power to pull my horse trailer with two horses up hills. On snow and ice this truck is very stable and brakes on ice fast and strait with it's 4 wheel antilock brakes. This truck is a best buy in my book !<br><br>
