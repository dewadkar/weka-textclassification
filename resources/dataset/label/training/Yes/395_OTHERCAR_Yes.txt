                 When I saw the commercial for the Nissan Exterra with its inside bike rack, integrated first aid kit, and just the way it looked, I wanted one right away.  The price was reasonable and definetly worth it.  The feature I really love about this sport utility vehicle is the bike rack.  When I'm done biking up in the mountains and its raining, I don't want my bike on the top or back of my car.  You can put the bike inside of the Exterra in the exact same way you would put it on the top, but it doesn't get wet and there is definetly no way it could fall off.  

     The thing I don't really like about this car, but totally understand why it isn't there is the locks and windows.  This car has no power locks or power windows.  In the age of technology you would think every car would have this, but it doesn't and it gets kind of old rolling those windows up all the time.  The reason I think that they have this is if you get in a crash or something and the car isn't on then you can roll down the windows to get out.  

     Driving this vehicle is a blast also.  Its super fun to drive offroad in this because of the comfortable seats and just the rush of bouncing around (even though the shocks are pretty good).  On the streets, it's just like any other vehicle and is quiet inside.

     I would recommend this vehicle for lots of people because of the great price and all of the features.  I really love it and it is as fun as it looks on TV.<br><br>
