            I've had my 2002 Saab 9-3 convertible for a little over a month. I had a couple of weeks in October to ride it with the top down before the cold really started to set in around here. I just LOVE the car. I can fold the top in less time than the lights takes to change from green to red, and since the moment that I drove the car out of the dealership for some undefinable reason I can't stop smiling whenever I'm driving. It's a fun ride, I love that little S button(on which the car changes to a Sport mode transmission or something like that). The seats are extremely comfortable, you can ride or drive for hours in them (already tried them in a 800-mile trip), and it is a real four seater. Adults fit in the back seat and don't complain about neck problems after getting out of the car. 

There's only one downside, the motor has a very particular, exciting roaring sound that makes you floor the acceleration, and that could get you in trouble. Other than that, I don't find any other complaints ;-).

All in all, it's a very peculiar car, that you'll either love or hate. If you like a bunch of cup holders, a lot of electronic little gizmos, and a "more of the same" kind of car don't even look at the Saab. In the other hand, if you like simplicity, style, something out of the ordinary, and a car that loves the road. Then try the Saab. It is a great value, for a great car.

Just wanted to give a little update. It's been almost a year since I got the car, and I still love it. I have put 17K miles on my Saabito and he doesn't notice it.  I would also like to say that I love the dealership and the service facility here in DC. They are very helpful and very approachable. As I said before I can't stop smiling when I drive this car. After a lot of friends have had a chance to ride in the car in both long and short trips, all they can say is that is very comfy, has a lot of style and they love that you don't hear the engine but you feel it "roar" on the road. 

As an additional thought I would like to add that we drove last winter to Timberline in West Virginia in the middle of a snowstorm and I thought that it was going to be a bit of a problem with my front wheel drive Saabito, as I've always driven 4x4's in the snow, but I was able to keep up with an Audi A6 with Quattro perfectly, no sliding, no insecurities, the car gripped the road and did not let loose.
