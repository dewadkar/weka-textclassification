            Originally Saabs were strange vehicles enjoyed by individuals who were a &quot;little different&quot;. The 1969 Saab 93 had a two stroke engine(read lawnmower) and the owners added a quart of oil to the gas tank when they refueled. That drew strange stares from service station staff.

Saabs steadily evolved in the 80's and by 1991 were a much better car than ever before. Models in the late 80's had severe problems with automatic transmissions and many now on the market from that era most certainly will have problems in that area.Recently Saab was purchased by GM and the added resources have allowed the company to build some excellent models.

Saabs still are a little quirky: ie the 900's key is on the console beside the shifter. Why? because it locks up the transmission as well as the ignition and doors. They have more wind noise than many other cars in their class however the luxury of the appointments: heated leather seats,good engine power, road handling ability,cargo space ( in a hatchback you can put in a pop machine and close the hatch),onboard computer information, etc make it a fun car to drive.<br><br>
