            I had to add my 2 cents worth concerning the '91 Chevy Lumina . Do I like the car ... Indeed. I am on my second '91 Lumina . ( For those that don't know , from 1991 through 1994 the car was essentially the same .. so why 2 '91 s ... because I bought my second Lumina last year for $3,000.00 , the dealer wanted $8,000.00 for a '94 with HIGHER mileage)

This car handles well, is cheap to fix , and for the most part is acceptable to teens .( And can , in most cases , outlast them .) My first Lumina expired only after my teenage daughter drove in well over 100 miles - 3 quarts low on oil !!!  But it brought her all the way home first !   I need to also mention that it had over 190,000 miles on it at the time . (I live in a rural community ) Dependability is not an option for us. Also a matter that we must consider is a car's ability to withstand run-ins with the local fauna - most specifically deer. My daughter's car was totaled, my Lumina had to have a fender straightened.  The trunk is big enough to haul 10 bags of mulch , or two weeks worth of groceries. 

I am not a mechanic , I know it has a 3.1 liter engine , no ABS , a great air-conditioner , a so-so radio/cassette player , and the brakes seems to go fast . But my only real complaint is with the alternator - which seems to need replacing every 2 years or so . According to my mechanic it is a flaw in the charging system that Chevy will not recognize . 



UPDATE : IMPORTANT 
We received notification via the mail that GM has agreed to pay for some "brake" repairs on certain model year Luminas and other models. You present proof of repair . They send you a check . If you haven't been notified - call your GM Dealer .
