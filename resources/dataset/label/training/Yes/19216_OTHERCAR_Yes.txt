            We bought our Buick LeSabre 1995 off a lot in December 1995 for a huge discount since the model year had already come out.  Since then we've been (more or less) nothing but pleased with the car.

First of all, it's got TONS of room!  It seats 5 adults comfortably, with more than enough room in the back bench seat.  The dual climate controls in the front cabin are great, and the digital thermostat controls always work flawlessly.

This car has a lot of &quot;get up and go&quot;.  I went from driving a mid-1980s Chevy pickup truck to driving this car, with power steering and a light tap on the gas sending it on it's way - FAST.  It takes some getting used to if moving up from a much smaller/lower-cost car, trust me, but once you get used to this car you'll drive nothing but it.  Also, it's an automatic transmission - not a must for me, but a definite plus :-D

It's very stylish, looking like it costs much more than it actually does, and the cost of maintainence is next to nothing.  UNFORTUNATELY, we've had a string of bad mechanics in the last 18 months, meaning the same thing has been &quot;fixed&quot; repeatedly (battery problems), though I would doubt it's the car and not just poor work done at the check-ups.

Also, for me, being a stereo and music fanatic, this car packs a great sound system for being &quot;standard&quot;.  It comes with, of course, the radio and tape deck, but also includes a special concert speaker system.  I must say, for a standard-with-the-car stereo, this one kicks major butt.  Sofar, all I've bought for the stereo is a tape head demagnetizer for $10 and it sounds almost better than the stereo I have in the house :-D

Overall, I'd say that the 1995 model year is a great year for Buick.  The only drawback I found to the car is one of it's positives - it's size.  This thing is great for long trips if you don't want to take the ugly, suburban staple stationwagon, but for running up to the supermarket . . . well let's just say the nose of this car sticks WAY out.  I've come DANGEROUSLY close to nudging other parked cars and I'm STILL getting used to the size of this thing for parking (though once again, I've only driven 3 cars, a 1967 VW Beetle, a pickup truck and this).

For your money on a used car lot, this is surely the one to get!<br><br>
