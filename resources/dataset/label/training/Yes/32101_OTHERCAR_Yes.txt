            After doing exhaustive research, I finally bought my 300M in December of 2001.

Outside: Sleek styling, nice curves, rear of the car is a little funny, but it looks all around "cool"!  I also have the chrome rims which, when clean, shine like a mirror and makes the car look really sharp.  The car is LONG.  I had a Jeep and a Maxima before this car and it took about 6 months to get used to the length of the car.  I've hit my fair share of parking guardrails during this time!  Also it is hard sometimes to see out of the back, as it is a bit "high".  I backed up into a stop sign once as the back pillar was blocking my view of it.  Good thing it didnt do any damage to the car, just a slight scratch.

Inside: All Leather seats, front adjustable.  I am 6'4" (tall) and I great trouble fitting in most cars.  This was a major factor in buying this car.  I fit in all seats comfortably.  The front seats are fully adjustable and the drivers seat has lumbar support.  The interior has a TON of room.  You could comfortably fit 4 or 5 big guys in the car and it wouldnt be cramped.  The trunk is also huge.  All the controls are well laid out and easy to operate.  

My major complaint I had about the car was the stereo - mine came with the 16 speaker Infinity package.  I like my music loud and with some power to it.  I had the almost the same system in the Jeep Cherokee and it was the best stock sound system I have ever had.  The 300M stereo just had no kick to it.  Bass would flatten out if too loud and would make it sound like crap.  I added a Infinity Basslink subwoofer and put it in the trunk, and now I like the stereo.  You can find the Basslink on Ebay for around $200.  It was the best money spent on this car.

Also the interior gets a little loud with road noise.  This has gotten better when I took off the stock Goodyear tires (will never buy Goodyears ever again, horrible tire) with Yokohama YK420s.  Still it seems a little loud to me.

The car handles very nicely for a big car.  It has a ton of pick up speed and corners well.  When you are cruising down the highway, you have to watch your spedometer, as I have been going 90 MPH and it felt like 70.

Overall I have had no problems with the car at all and highly recommend it!
