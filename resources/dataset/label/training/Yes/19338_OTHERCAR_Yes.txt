            My family purchased an '87 Volvo 740 Turbo sedan in the summer 1992, in part because I had just received my learner's permit.  Since then it has been in two accidents (a 4 car pile up that my sister hurt her neck in and my wife and I being viciously rear-ended by an LA MTA bus), seen both my sister and I earn our licenses, been the family car, been the work car, been the trip car, and done over 100,000 miles of hard metro California driving.  And I still love it.
  First of all, it is the most comfortable car I have ever driven or ridden in.  The front seats are like a Swedish Massage, and the back has decent leg room for two adults.  My cloth interior has had no tearing or fading problems, and I haven't taken the best care of it.  The exterior styling is a matter of taste, but I'm never embarrassed of the car, and have no qualms about taking it out for a night on the town.  The paint  needs regular waxing at this point, but it isn't oxidizing too terribly.  It is pretty dent resistant, even when attacked but bottle-throwing, jack-booted gang members (I kind of live in a bad neighbourhood...).  Wind noise is noticeable, but better than almost all American cars I've ridden in.  The stock stereo is also quite good, and climate controls are excellent.
  The maintenance is a bit of a tender subject, as I just poured $1900 into the car for brakes, rotors, transmission and engine fixes and sundry other stuff.  You'll need to change the oil regularly due to the turbo, and every 30,000 miles should have an inspection with this era of Volvo after 120,000 miles.  At every 60,000 miles or so, expect to cough up $400-$600 in regular maintenance and face the possibility of $1000+ in &quot;optional&quot; repairs.  Get to know a good Volvo mechanic: they love the cars, and want what's best, but will generally give the the skinny on what is essential and how long you can let other things slide.
  As far as fun, the car gets up and goes when you tell it too.   The brakes are great (they better be, grumble, grumble), and the turning radius is better than just about any car on the market.  As far as body noise, get your joint seals replaced, as the rubber rots eventually, and the creaks will go down 80% or more.
  If I were in the market for a used car in the $4000-$7000 range, I would definitely consider another 740 Turbo.  Look for regular oil changes and maintenance records, especially body work, as an accident can compromise the frame of the vehicle, which will give you alignment problems and uneven tire wear.  Overall, one of the best values for your money possible.<br><br>
