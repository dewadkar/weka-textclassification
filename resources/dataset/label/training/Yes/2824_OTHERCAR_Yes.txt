            <b> Introduction </b>
I was sitting at Applebee's on Monday of this past week, and as I read 'USA Today', I came across this full page ad about the Lexus Golden Opportunity sales special which was going on this month. This immediately perked my interest because I am in the market for an -entry- level luxury automobile. (A recent study showed that the entry level... being in the $30,000-$40,000 range... is the fastest growing car market, and is most popular with young professionals in their mid to late 20's.)

Over the past several months I have been researching online, reading about peoples expereinces with brands such as BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Lexus, Acura, and Volvo, and concluded that I wanted to get a Lexus. This was all before I had even been to a lot to test drive one. Yes, about an hour of my day at work is spent reading and researching cars online. I admit it. lol

<b> Visiting the Lot </b>
My first visist occurred a couple months ago. I was on my lunch hour and didn't really have time to test drive the GS 300, but I did give it a good look over and it looked quite good in real life.

I will have to say that visiting a Lexus dealership is quite the strange experience. This is a GOOD thing. The salesman I talked with,  Travis, was not pushy in any way, shape, form, or fashion. He was very nice and seemed genuinely interested in helping me. 

Fast forward to this week. I emailed Lexus of Huntsville on Friday around 1:00pm. About 10 minutes later I received a phone call from Travis inviting me down for a test drive at my earliest convenience. I didn't commit to anything and told him I'd drop by soon.

Saturday I took my parents with me because they are looking at buying a Cadillac, and I wanted them to have something to kind of compare it to. (You will NEVER see me driving a Cadillac...)

So we drove to Huntsville and pulled up in my 1997 Nissan Sentra. We got out and walked over to where the GS 300's were parked. A lady came out and I quickly informed her that I had been talking to Travis about the GS 300. She said she would go inside and get him.

<b> The Test Drive </b>
I saw him walk out of the building and walk down the opposite way from us. We continued perusing the stickers, and Travis drove up in a Black GS 300 with Black Leather interior (which is what I had described to them in the email.)

He got out, and just said, "Here take this one out."

Ok, that completely floored me. He didn't ask any questions. Nothing. Just left it running and that was it. So we got in. From the second we closed the doors, it was obvious that this was a finely crafted automobile.

<b> Features/Nitnoids </b>
I drove it out of the parking lot and onto the highway. The car had very good pickup. At in-town highway speeds (50 mph) the car was very quiet. I took it onto the interstate and cruised at 80 mph and there was just a tad bit more wind/road noise than I would have expected. Yes, 80 mph is my typical Interstate cruising speed. I have a 30 mile stretch I drive to work on everyday, and everyday it's like the Indy 500 going to work. Fast and Furious agressive driving. I just go with the flow. If everyone else is doing 85, so am I.

The sound system includes a 6 disc changer mounted in the glove box. Overall I didn't think the sound system was all that bassy. It seemed to lack any 'punch'. I mean it sounded good, but not $40,000 good. At typical cruising speeds, the sound was clear and easy to listen to.

The gages in the dash took a little while to get use to. They are recessed and a good bit smaller in size (speedo and tach) then what I am use to. All controls are within easy reach, although, I don't totally know what all of them do. There are several dozen buttons all around the console and such.

The AC system works great. The climate controls took a minute or 2 to figure out, but it cooled the cabin quite quickly on this 88 degree day. It has  different temperature gages, one tells you the temp inside, the other outside.

The trunk has 14.8 cu ft of space. You would think that is a pretty good amount, but it is in the shape of a "T". So actually putting luggage in there is a potential problem because of the design. It's hard to explain, but you can only put a suit case in the center, leaving the sides for smaller luggage. It is quite strange.

Overall seat comfort is spectacular. It was like driving while sitting in a Lazy boy recliner. Those were the most comfortable seats I have ever sat in. They alone almost made me buy it today. The leather trimmed seats looked very nice as well.

One thing I liked, was the rear view mirror has a little digital compass built in. So you know what direction you are going. That's pretty cool. 

Overall, the car is relatively easy to see out of. There is plenty of glass. The only blind area is where the rear pillars are. The body section there is about a foot and a half thick.

With a curb weight of nearly 3700 lbs, the car handles very nicely. It's as smooth as butter. The steering is effortless. The brakes do their job. The ride is also very smooth and cushy.

<b> Conclusions </b>
No matter which way you slice it. $40K for a car is a lot of money. While it did drive very nicely and had some nice festures, at this point in time, I'm having serious trouble justifying this purchase. The road noise thing really bothers me, and when I said something to Travis about it, he admitted he too had noticed the other day that the GS300 had some noise issues like that. (but stated the LS430 didn't, but it also costs $60K) 

I was also very disappointed in the factory sound system. For spending $40K, I would hoped to have gotten better. One of my best friends just bought a loaded 2002 Saturn for like $20K and the sound system in that thing is excellent for a factory setup. Also, the noise levels in the Saturn are on par with what I heard in the Lexus today. (That's comparing apples and oranges, but it was close)

In the end though, I'll probably end up buying one. I'm sure the reasons are all purely superficial... but in the end, it is a nice car that rides really well, and looks really sharp.

I'll update this one with more details as I think of more, but these are my initial thoughts. If I actually do get one here in a couple of weeks, I'll go more in depth on how the car is.

<b> Update August 23,2001 </b>
After losing some sleep, I decided not to buy the car. Travis called me up on Wednesday with the final tallys. It was going to be $40,166 with monthly payments of $675. I also had checked with the insurance people and it was going to run $80/month.

Given the current state of the economy and the un-stability of the aerospace engineering field (Boeing-NASA), I thought it would be wisest to wait until the first of the year and see if we are in a depression or not. Travis was totally understanding about this and told me to check back with him at the first of the year.

I <b>WILL</b> own this car one day soon.

Thanks for reading.
