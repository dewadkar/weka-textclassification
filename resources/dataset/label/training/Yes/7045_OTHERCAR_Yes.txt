            The first car I ever bought was a Mazda 626.  I had just graduated law school and wanted what I considered a professional looking car but still had class and some umph to it.  

I tested every other car in its class.  I spent months driving the Accord, Camry, Galant, and all the others.  I fell in love with the 6 cylinder model once i drove it and couldn't go back to the 4 cylinder ever again.  In my opinion the Mazda was so much nicer to drive than the other cars.  It had great pick-up and feel and was a joy to drive.   It is also roomy in the back according to my 6 foot brother.

I wanted a black car so they had to get me one from another lot, but within a few days i had my 1994 Mazda 626.  My car has 96,000 miles on it today and I do still love it.  However I did run into some problems with it around the 60,000/5year period.  I started having transmission problems.  Because I had purchased the extended warranty it was still covered.  To make a long story short, I had 3 different transmissions put in before I was happy with the way it was running.  I don't know if it was the dealership that I brought it to or just a fluke but it was a problem for a few months.  It has been over a year since the right transmission was put in and it has been fine.  I added a remote starter to help it in the cold weather also.

All in all I do love my car and would buy another one.  The transmission problem didn't cost me anything but time because it was covered under the warranty.  One little thing to consider is the gas mileage.  During this time of high gas prices it can be an added expense if you do a lot of driving.  The 6 cylinder model is great, but the gas adds up.  Drive one for yourself and see.  You will probably be hooked.  Good luck!<br><br>
