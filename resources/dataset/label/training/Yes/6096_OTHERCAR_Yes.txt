            My wife wanted to get rid of her Saturn SL1 as it was costing us a fortune to maintain. We looked at all the four door sedans available and eventually bought an '01 Impala. 

I first saw the current Impala in 2000 and was both intrigued and disappointed. I loved the previous version - what the NYPD referred to as the 'bubble' car, especially the SS version of the mid '90's. But the new one had an aggressive stance to it that I liked. What took me the longest to get used to were the two huge round tail lamps on each side. Impalas have always had three lamps per side. 

We were almost ready to sign for a new Crown Vic. The only thing holding us back was the price. We stopped in at one Chevy dealer near us. He had one base Impala on the lot but neither my wife nor I liked the salesman so we left. 

We tried another dealer, also nearby, and he was like a Saturn salesman. He also had one base Impala there and the color was okay with my wife so we bought it. 

If you want a recommendation on who to buy a Chevy from in the Long Island, NY area, ping me and I'll fill you in. 

There was a commercial on TV last year where a guy gets into an Impala (LS) with the sales woman and he immediately says he wants it. She encourages him to drive it before making the decision so he drives it a foot and says, yup, he wants it. That's what it was like when I sat in the car. It just felt perfect. The test drive was totally unnecessary but I'm glad I did it anyway. 

We have the base model with an AM/FM RDS radio and cassette, which sounds great.  Our car, the base Impala, has just standard equipment, except for the cruise control, which may have been an option.  I don&#146t have the window sticker or brochures anymore so I am not sure. But the cruise control comes with a stalk mounted on/off switch and the set/coast, and accel/resume buttons on the steering wheel.  The cruise control holds the car at speed within +/-1 mph on all types and gradients of roads.  The car has a cloth front bench seat that is very comfy, good for a day trip, a trunk that is big enough that I can&#146t touch the rear seatback without taking both feet off the ground and crawling in, a commodious backseat that can fit three adults no problem, and a front seat, with the center console folded up, that can also fit three adults.  

The car has an interesting way of letting you know if you locked the doors when you leave the car.  If you lock the doors, the interior lights slowly fade to black (very cool).  If you leave a door unlocked, the interior lights stay on full, even after all the doors are closed.  Of course, this feature is only useful at night.  The car also has a programmable autolock system that will let you set it to do nothing, or lock the doors when you shift into drive, as well as a couple of other settings.  I have the system turned off so I&#146m not sure what the other settings are.  I like cars to do as little for me automatically as possible.

The view to outside from the driver&#146s seat is outstandingly unimpeded.  The car has both driver and passenger door electric mirrors that are easy to adjust without going past where you want them to be.  The mirrors are large and offer an excellent view to the rear.

Performance from the base 3.4L, 180hp V6 is brisk and very smooth.  It accelerates well enough to get onto a highway and pass with little drama.  It is rated at 20 mpg city and 30 mpg highway.  I have not done any actual mileage testing myself as I don't drive the car on a regular basis.

I have always had small cars so it took me a while to get used to the handling of the Impala.  Although not as big as a Crown Vic it is still a big car and has a slight amount of body roll in quick side to side transitions.  It wasn&#146t until I was shopping for a car for myself this year that I tried out the equivalent of the Impala LS 3.8L 200hp V6, high performance suspension and 4 wheel disc brakes (in an SS Monte Carlo) to find that I prefer the high-zoot performance options.  My wife is happy with the car as it is (if it goes, doesn&#146t break down, and has AC and music then it&#146s okay by her) but if it was mine exclusively I would have gone for the LS with the larger engine and sport suspension, which has considerably less body roll.  But don&#146t get me wrong.  There is nothing wrong with the base model.  I love driving it.  But given the option, I&#146d take an LS.  A little more is a little better.  =o)

The one negative about this car, as well as my Monte Carlo, is that it is all too easy to bottom and scrape the underside of the front, body-colored bumper on driveway aprons at anything more than a snail&#146s pace.  Since I have done the same on my sport-suspension equipped Monte Carlo SS, it&#146s a safe bet to say that the Impala LS will do the same thing.  The Impala and the Monte Carlo use the same platform (identical wheelbase), as well as engines, transmissions and running gear.  Approach driveway aprons with care.

We got a great deal on our base Impala, under $20k, and have had it for two years. It has been completely trouble free. Even though I have a new Monte Carlo SS I still enjoy driving the Impala. If it was completely up to me I'd get another one when we trade it in two years. But I'll have to see what the boss says. =o)
