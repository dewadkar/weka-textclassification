            Dear reader,

I have had this car for 4-5 months now, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. This car can be taken anywhere on any terrain. It handles fabulously! It can go up mountains and through swamps, no joke!!
This car is big enough to fit a big family. It is easy to transport my things from place to place as well. 
This car has great features. Wood panelling is optional (though I highly reccomend it!) and so is a CD player. All of the buttons in the car have worked perfectly since I have had no problems (knock on wood).
This car also looks great. It has the look of a sleek sports car but the size of a truck. It is very practical.
Thank you for reading and I hope that you will look at some of my other reviews. <br><br>
