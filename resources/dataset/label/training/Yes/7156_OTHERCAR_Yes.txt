            I bought a 98 chevy S-10 because of its sleek look, and comfortable interior.  The LS package offers CD, cruise, tilt, air, auto, and a snappy 4.3 ltr V-6 that takes charge of the pavement.  This is a reliable truck, fun to drive, and very good looking.  With optional 3rd door, and step side for added eye catching looks, this S-10 is a smart buy, and a fun truck.  The truck I own is a sport side, and I get comments on it everywhere I go.  People love this truck.  White lettered tires from the factory, and dark tinted glass.  This truck is not just another pretty face though, I haul a snowmobile, and a four wheeler.  I hunt and fish, with optional four wheel drive, you are unlimited to what you can do with this truck.  Go test drive one today.
