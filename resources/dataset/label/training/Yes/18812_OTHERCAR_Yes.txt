            I bought a 1998 Jeep Cherokee Limited in September of 1997. After a short problem with delivery, I received it in November.  I got the full package, with the exception of heated mirrors and heated seats.  We don't have much use for these in Southeast Texas.

I test-drove everything from the Chevy Suburban to the Mitsubishi Montero. For the price, there was no comparison.  The only vehicle that I would have rated above the Cherokee was the aforementioned Suburban, but I did not rate it $20,000 above it, which was the price tag difference, with similar options.  I did not purchase the Grand Cherokee (a close third) due to the full time 4 wheel drive Quadratrac.  I am quite capable of deciding when I need and don't need 4 wheel drive capability, which is not possible with the Grand's Quadratrac, but it is possible with the Cherokee's Selectrac.

I can not say enough good things about this vehicle.  I've put over 45000 miles on it in two years.  In that time, it has developed two small leaks, which one would have to look for to find.  One is on the transfer case, the other on the power steering pump.  The gas mileage is right at 19 - 20 mpg highway, but only about 15 in the city.  As far as the handling and ride, I like it as much now as I did right off the showroom floor.  I perform standard maintenance on the vehicle; oil changes and ATF changes at regular intervals.  Right now, it needs its first brake job, but I obviously put most of my miles on the vehicle on the highway (little braking).  I've logged about 10000 miles on it towing.  I've also put about the same on it in off road conditions.  The remaining 25000 miles have been in highway or city driving.

The bad things about the vehicle are few and minor, but I will list them regardless.  When in part-time four wheel drive, there is a definite slipping when a tight turn is attempted, regardless of road condition.  I do not use part time 4 wheel drive for this reason.  The ride is noisy, with a lot of wind and road noise through the body.  The front seat cannot be in the fully extended (back) position when you lower the back seat.  You must adjust the front seat slightly forward to do this.  The towing capacity leaves a little to be desired, but I did not get this vehicle for towing purposes.

If I were to purchase another vehicle in this class, I would definitely go with the Cherokee once again.  Its off road capability is legendary, winning 4 wheeler of the year time and again.. though for 1998, the Grand Cherokee took this honor.  As far as the joy of driving, only the Wrangler compares.

This car is a winner.  If you purchase it, you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
