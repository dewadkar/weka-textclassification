            As the wife of a master auto technician, choosing a car can be difficult.  He knows the pros and cons of just about every vehicle manufactured.  When we moved out to the country with our 5 children, we started looking for a 4-wheel drive that would hold the whole family and cargo.   Our options were a Suburban or the Ford Excursion.  My husband is totally anti-GM, so we focused on the Excursion.  After test driving the Excursion, we knew it was the vehicle for us.  
At 5'8&quot; I was able to comfortably sit in the 3rd row seat with plenty of leg room.  The driver's seat is comfortable with controls within easy reach, even for our 5'4&quot; friend!  Getting little ones in and out of it is a breeze. 
They say the size is huge, but actually our old full size station wagon and our older Ford F250 pick-up club cab are both longer.  The height hasn't been an issue, nor has the width.  As far as I'm concerned, if it fits in the car wash, it's fine! 
Gas mileage, considering its size is decent.  We purchased the V10 with the upgraded differential and on trips (even with the oxygenated fuel) we average almost 15 mpg.  
As far as the argument that it drives like a truck - when you purchase it, you should know you are purchasing a vehicle on a truck chassis.  It handles just like our F250, but in my opinion that is just fine.
I've owned my Excursion for almost a year and couldn't be happier.  <br><br>
