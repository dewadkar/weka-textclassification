            I've been driving for over 40 years (including SCCA road racing), literally millions of miles, and have owned over 100 vehicles.
My 1991 Camry DX (4 cylinder, 5-speed, no frills) is probably the best practical car (I've owned lots of impractical cars; classics, racing, sports, etc.) I've ever owned. Purchased for my wife (used; 10,000 miles) in 1993 for $10K, this car had NO extras, not even air conditioning. Our climate has hot Summers, so we immediately installed factory air ($1500). We prefer a car without auto windows & door locks, so it suits us just fine as is. We've always preferred stick-shift cars, but my wife decided she wanted an automatic (bad left knee), so we bought her a 1992 Corolla, and the Camry became "my" car. I find the Camry far superior to the Corolla.

This car drives like an extension of myself. Comfortable ride, handles well, stops fast & straight. No hot rod, but has plenty of power for my needs. Average fuel use is 31 mpg, combined local & freeway driving. I'm over 6', with long legs. This is one of the very few cars I've driven where I don't have to put the seat all the way back.

At 156,000 miles, reliability has been exceptional. For some reason, we needed to replace the alternator, twice (under warranty), but the 3rd has lasted over 100K miles. The car is serviced regularly, by an excellent independent shop. I'd like to change the oil every 3K miles, but usually only get around to it by 5K. The CV boots have been replaced twice; timing belt replaced twice (Toyota used to recommend this at 60K, changed now to 90K). I didn't like the original tires, so I immediately replaced them (Dunlop SP40), and am on my 3rd set. Otherwise (except for tune-up parts), all is original, even the brakes & clutch. Only one light bulb has had to be replaced! This car is not garaged, and is exposed to our wet Winters & hot Summers, yet the finish (metallic blue) looks like new. I try to wax it once a year.

My mechanic says the engine is like new & should be good for another 100K miles. Emissions remain far below California's strict standards. We're planning a 5000 mile road trip, and I have no hesitation about taking our Camry.

I've been looking for another 90-91 Camry (less than 100K miles) for several years (I don't like the styling of the newer Camrys). The only ones I've seen have very high miles (200K+), or are "salvaged" (rebuilt wrecks, flood victims, etc.). If you know of a good '91 Camry (especially in white), let me know at mgrandy@jps.net.
