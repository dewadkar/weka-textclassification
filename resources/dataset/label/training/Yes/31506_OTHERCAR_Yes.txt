            When my last car broke down recently, I decided I'd had enough with used cars. I was in the market for a compact car that got great gas mileage and looked good.  I admit I was smitten with the Sentra's &quot;mini-Maxima&quot; looks.
but decided to shop around.  I test drove a Golf, a Civic,  a Daewoo Leganza, and looked at the Toyota Corolla, and Echo.  I Just loved everything about the Sentra.  It has an all new 1.8 129 hp. DOHC inline 4 engine.  Living in Seattle meant that a automatic was a necessary component. The standard features on the GXE drew me to the Sentra as Well.
Power windows, dual airbags, power locks, tachometer, cd, A/C, and Child Safety Locks.  The options that I selected were the spoiler and the Keyless Entry.  The spoiler sets the Sentra off and transforms the look of the car from Normal everyday look alike compact to a Distinguishable Beauty. The keyless entry takes away the possibilities of looking your keys in the car.  If you are looking for a Nice, smooth refined Car, Look No further than the Sentra
