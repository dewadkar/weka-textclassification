            I drive a 1998 4 door LS model Chevy Blazer with 4 wheel drive. I cannot tell you enough how much I love my car. I had an 89 Blazer before, and the newer models boast much better safety features. I hit a Volvo going 70 on the interstate, both air bags deployed, the seat belt worked great and the crumple zone in the front end probably saved me from serious injury. I walked away from the wreck. The Blazer is quick compared to other sluggish SUVs, not so huge that you can't park it, and the push button 4 wheel drive is an excellent feature if you will be driving in snow, hard rain, or in rural areas with unpaved roads. The ride is smooth, the car looks good (four door better than two door in my opinion), and it's one of the safest domestic cars on the road. Plus, if you ever need to tow anything, the Blazer is the car for you.<br><br>
