            Every time I look at my 96' Sunfire it takes me back. The year was 1996 and the place was our local Pontiac dealer.  I stood squinting. Somewhere in the distance a dog barked.  I was there to  TRADE! I owned a &#14594; full-size, extended cab GMC pickup. I had been recently married and the truck with its 4375 foot turning radius proved to much for my wife to "zip around" in.  I quickly noticed the Sunfire sitting in the front row and asked the salesmen for a test drive.  I was delighted when he handed me the keys and didn't climb in. (Sorry Nick)

I was impressed by the cars quick response steering and the cornering was amazing compared to my GMC. Of course the fact that a 32 foot motor home could out maneuver that truck never entered my mind. I was impressed.  

The braking was excellent and predictable.  The clattering of the anti-lock brake system (ABS) was a little un-nerving due to the fact that the chattering came from directly under the hood in front of the drivers seat.  The clattering was the ABS system pulsing each wheel individually to allow steering during emergency braking as well as improved braking characteristics. 

Acceleration was not as good as my Dad's car, ( a Pontiac Grand-Am with the 2.4 liter engine)
but it was still very quick.  I later realized that at 115 mph. the rev. limiter kicks in but I hoped my wife would never notice with her in-town driving. That reminds me. I was impressed with the dual air bags.  The car was later recalled for those same said air bags. Apparently the air bags were going off for no reason while driving down the road and I guess some one complained or something. (NOTE if you are considering the purchase of a used &#14596; Sunfire be sure the air bags have been properly adjusted.)  

5 Years later.

Problems:
Well probably due to my test drive I had to have the brakes replaced earlier than I had liked. Other than that the only things I have noticed are as follows. The shock boots (cheap plastic boots to keep out debris) have all broken and come loose causing annoying little rattles at idle.  Also plastic wheel covers will not tighten enough to prevent chattering while driving on rough dirt roads.  Wiper seating gear broke which I replaced for $3 and a whole days work because all the bolts require special tools. (NOTE If this happens to you and you decide to waste entire Sat. fixing it yourself be sure to use Lock-Tite on replacement part so you don't waste the following Sat. fixing it again as I did)  

Non-Problems:
I love the fact that this car has a large grab handle for adjusting the drivers seat back and forth. My wife is 5'2" and I am 6'2" and climbing in the car after her is no sweat because as I get in I can easily reach the handle and allow my momentum to adjust the seat as I sit.
I opted out of the initial under coat and after five years on salty winter roads there is no corrosion on the underside.  
The 2.2 liter engine runs as smooth today with 60,000 miles as it did new. 
The short wheel base allows U turns on side streets with out stopping.
Mileage has decreased slightly(20/34) but new plugs and wires as well as a tune-up in the spring will probably help.
The automatic tranny is still solid. 
The interior has remained well intact despite the addition of a third family member who spills as much as he eats.  We were considering the purchase of a four door at his arrival but my wife insisted that she wanted to keep her car.  For me loading and unloading him is a pain in the back but soon he can load himself. 
The red paint job is far more durable than the Sunbird's. ( The Sunfire's forerunner).

Our's isn't a sports car, but with its good looks and decent performance it may just last long enough to be a classic.

     7 years later
Well at 88,000 miles I finally had to have the head gasket replaced. Total cost for parts and labor $397.40 Other than that and a few minor dings the car is still running well and we still really like the car. I will let you know how it all turns out.
