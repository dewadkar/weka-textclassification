            I purchased this camera because I was going on a trip to mainland China and I didn't want to lug a 35mm camera with me and have to worry about purchasing and developing all those canisters of film upon my return.  I also knew that I would be taking a lot of pictures so a digital camera with just a memory stick wouldn't suffice either.  And then I wanted it to be affordable.  <br>
Well, the Sony Mavica FD100 fit the bill very well for me.  I purchased mine in July, 2002 for just under $400.  It has a 3.5 floppy drive and a slot for the Sony Memorystick.  I used approximately 45 floppies to capture close to 900 pictures at the low resolution mode (getting roughly 30 pics per floppy).  <br>
Since the trip, I've purchased a 64mb Memorystick which at the low resolution mode will capture close to 250 pictures and at the fine resolution mode will hold 150 pictures.  I've not had another trip like the China trip so I haven't really had to use the floppy drive.  The Memorystick is more than adequate.  <br>
<b>PC Connections</b>
The camera has a USB connection and with Windows XP, it is recognized instantly as a another device within Windows Explorer.  In fact, you can use the camera's drive as another floppy drive on your system if you wanted to. With Explorer, you can copy picture files directly from the camera to your hard drive very quickly.  At the low resolution the picture files are roughly 150kb.  The fine resolution puts them at 350kb.  <br>
<b>Downside</b>
I really don't have too many complaints about this camera other that the flash is very limited.  Object more than 15 feet away from the camera aren't illuminated very well by the flash and there is not external jack to connect a more powerful unit.  That is the biggest disappointment for me since I do a lot of indoor work under various lighting conditions.  <br>
<b>A Good Buy</b>
Overall, this is a very functional camera.  I have given my 35mm SLR to my wife so she can start to learn photography.  The zoom on the camera is very good and I have my camera with me all the time so I can shoot any nice images that cross my path daily.  This camera coupled with the low cost of CDs has allowed me to enjoy photo shooting much more than with my regular 35mm SLR.  <br>
Sony has a website where you can upload your photos and share them with family and friends for free.  Let me invite you to check out some of my photos taken with the Mavica FD100 at http://www.imagestation.com/album/?id=4291450899
