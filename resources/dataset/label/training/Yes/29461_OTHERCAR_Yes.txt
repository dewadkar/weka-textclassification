            I bought this car because I'm a guy who likes to have fun.  You don't buy the Wrangler to be efficient or because you want something that's cheap.  You buy it because it is a fun car to drive around in and it's cool.  A Jeep Wrangler is a great car to buy if you want a cool SUV that's not too expensive.  The car uses up tons of gas and gets pretty cold in the winter (especially if you have a soft top).  This is definately NOT a family car, and not one you would want if looking for great safety features.  It is my favorite car to drive around in the summer- it's a great party car.  The backseat is small and uncomfortable, and there's not much storage space.  I would not get this as the your priority car.  I would say that you should get it A) if you're young and in school (16-25) or B) if it's your second car and it's just for fun.  Trust me, it's worth looking in to.<br><br>
