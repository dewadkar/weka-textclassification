            The SONY Mavica Digital Camera is one of the best Digital cameras in the market.  

I bought my first Sony to use in a business application.  Our company manages a card access control system for a large corporation.  

We needed to have the ability to take portraits of employees in multiple facilities across the United States.  The portraits were needed in order to produce an access badge with a photo for each employee.  

The Sony cameras allows the individual taking the pictures to store them images on a standard floppy disk.  This ability allows us to take the disk with images and load them into our database and produce badges without sending personnel all over the United States.

I also had the opportunity to take one of the Cameras to a NFL game and take some pictures.  Using the sports mode, I was able to take professional action photos of the game.  My friends and family were amazed that these photos looked so good.

I will continue use and purchase the Sony Mavica Digital Cameras. <br><br>
