            I needed something reliable.  I wanted something manageable.  I couldn't afford something really fancy.  I needed a Mazda Protege.  

I got my Protege new in 1997, and it is still going strong.  Of course, I do all the recommended maintenance stuff, oil changes, and the like, but would you believe that in the 2 1/2 years I've had it, almost 50,000 miles later, this car has NEVER given me one ounce of trouble?

This was a major improvement from my Ford Tempo!!

I love my car.  It is safe, with dual airbags, has a great stereo and a lot of amenities, and was affordable.  Why spend oodles of money on something that is no better, except perhaps in snobby status stuff?  Yea, Mazda! 

Mine is named &quot;roadrunner,&quot; because it has an alarm on it that goes &quot;beep, beep!&quot; like in the cartoon.<br><br>
