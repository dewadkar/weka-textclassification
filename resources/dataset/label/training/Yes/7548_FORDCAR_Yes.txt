             I have owned a 94' F-150 for well over a year now. I have put over 40,000 miles on it in this time. It has a total mileage of 150,000 miles and still has the original drivtrain. I have never owned a vehicle other than this one so I do not really have anything to compare it to, but I do know what i know. I have never had to do any repairs to my F-150 since i have had it. With that many miles that says more than enough. In the following categories I will break it down piece by piece to let you know everything possible about this vehicle.

Engine (8)- I have the XL version of the truck so it has the 300 6 cylinder. Don't let the term "6 cylinder" fool you. The 300 is the world's best motor ever built in many's opinion. What it lacks in horsepower it more than makes up for in torque. Just in case you are wondering, I have not made any modifications to it. It is completely and totally factory. This motor is a very powerful motor to be the weakest put in an F-150.

Handling (7)- For it to be a full size truck there isn't really much more to ask. It has a better turning radius than Chevrolet and Dodge. Since it was designed for towing and hauling it has a tendency to lean in a turn. But the suspension is well adapted for on or off road use. The Ford is popular for its suspensions. There are 3 main vehicles that have a better suspension, they are: Hummer, Land Rover, and Jeep. All the rest can just go home.

Interior (7)- The interior is all whatever you prefer. It is a very simple design. There is no fancy trim or sculpted dash. Some people actually prefer this type of interior. why spend money on something you want use. The seating is very comfortable. It has enough room to seat 3 full size adults comfortably. One of the biggest cons to the interior is the seat material. In the XL versions you are stuck with vynl seats. Of course this makes it very easy to clean and maintain, but on a hot day you seem to stick to the seat. The radio is another thing that could use some help. It comes with a radio. That's it, no tape player, no CD player, no nothing. Just a radio.

Exterior (9)- The exterior is a very basic design. There is no excessive use of curves or unwanted designs. The rear of the vehicle is somewhere around 2-3 inches higher than the front which gives it a slight aggressive look. This also helps with large loads. Have you ever seen a truck going down the road with the back end on the ground do to a heavy load? That looks so tacky it is pathetic. Whenever you through a load on an F-150 it simply sits level. On the XL version it has grey bumpers and rims. But if you get an XLT you get full chrome.

Reliability (10)- Well it is like I said before. I have owned it for more than a year and 40,000 miles and never had a problem. everything on the truck is factory..... other than tires that is. I don't know about you but I don't baby it either. I drive it like it was stolen. It has been 4 feet in the air on a dirt road and it didn't hurt a thing. the only thing i have done to this truck that did any damage was i backed into a ditch at 45mph. Just to add this in it will do 55mph in reverse.

Overall (8.2)- It didn't turn out to be such a bad vehicle after all. I wanted a 94' Chevy but got stuck with the Ford instead. Now if I had it all over to do again I would have picked the F-150 to begin with.
