               We initially bought this truck because we pull  a sixteen foot trailer quite often. This is an older trailer so it is very heavy. A friend of ours had one of these trucks, except his was a four wheel drive and he really loved it. We had ridden in his several times and knew when we went shopping this was what we wanted.

 We have never been sorry for it. This truck pulls that trailer loaded like it isn't even attached. You can't tell the trailer is even being pulled. It has so much power nothing bogs it down.

 We have had this truck nearly two years and it's gas mileage just keeps getting better. My husband drives the truck 300 miles a day so gas mileage is very important to us. At first it got around 19 miles per gallon. Now it gets about 21 miles per gallon. That is excellent for this size truck.

The ride is somewhat rougher than a luxury car, but no rougher than any other truck we ever owned. Our little half ton is rougher. It is a very versatile truck as well. It's rugged enough to go through pastures and mud holes, but still nice enough to take the family to church or town. There are always several of these trucks pulling floats in parades around here.

 As yet, we have found no drawbacks to this truck.  It is easily driven and handled on the road. Ours is a standard and none of us have any trouble driving it. Two of our daughters learned to drive with this truck.

 It is truly an amazing truck. Despite all the miles we put on it, it has never required anything but normal maintenance.<br><br>
