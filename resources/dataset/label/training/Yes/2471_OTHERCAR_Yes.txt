                 Daimler Chrysler has definately created one heck of a car with their new 2000 Concorde.  Similar to the Dodge Intrepid, the Concord seems more roomier and has more trunk room.  Both the back and front seats are comfortable to be in.  In fact, this is one of the first cars that I have felt alright in the rear middle seat.  Holding up to five, the interior is nice, even in the basic models, not to mention the LXI edition.

     The Concorde is also full of power, which makes driving it that much more the better.  The handling is also good.  The new Concorde is equipped with front wheel drive, as are most in its class, and can be purchased anywhere between $20,906 and $26,385.  This is around the price range of other cars.

     I prefer the Concorde over the similar Dodge Intrepid because of the extra room, and the style.  However, under the hood, the cars are pretty much the same.

     The 2000 Chrysler is a great car, one which I believe is at the top of its class.  For a full size car, I would almost classify it as a luxury, that is if it had that extra sixth seat.  I believe that there is room for an extra passanger, but for that, you would need the Chrysler LHS.<br><br>
