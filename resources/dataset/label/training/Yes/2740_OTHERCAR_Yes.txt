            Overall, I first must say that this is a pretty good little truck.  I like almost everything about it, except for the power.  If you want to find out about this one deficit as well as its good points, please read on.

I'm going to begin with what I had said about the power of the vehicle because at its essence, that point is the most important thing I have to give to the reader.  PLEASE GET THE V6 MODEL!!!  Our family has the 4 cylinder and quite frankly, it has virtually no kick.  We even have the manual transmission that would presumably give you a little bit more power but even with this, it remains a dog.  If you read my review on the Toyota Tacoma model that I used to have, you will see that I rated this very highly for its quickness and punch.  When you drive this model year and even the later-year S-10's, there is a severe lack of get up and go.  Now as far as the 6 cylinder, yes it gets the job done.  I had the V6 engine that is put in this truck, in the S-10's bigger brother, the Silverado. [If you would like you can also read my review on the 99 Silverado]  As far as I know, they put the same engine in both no matter if you opt to get compact (S-10) or full size (Silverado).  

With respect to the other important dimension of the truck's engine which is torque, the little guy seems to do fine.  I used the 4 cylinder to move my entire room back from college on a 2 hr. hilly trip and everything turned out fine.  On the freeway it seemed to never miss a beat after I got past the onramp.

Comfort and ease of function in the vehicle is a major plus for the small truck.  Quite often you would think that car maker would skimp on the lowest level little pickup but this was not the case.  We don't have pretty much a standard model of the S-10 and even so, it is very comfortable and luxurious for a truck.  It has nice cushy seats and an inviting overall interior.  It rides very quiet for a small truck and you feel in control with all of the controls like the heater and the radio.

It is very stylish in my opinion for a little truck. It is much less &quot;boxy&quot; then its predecessors and seems to have a more intelligent look to it.  I know just from our vehicle that it comes in a wide variety of colors and looks or packages.

And lastly, it has been very durable.  We have had it for a number of years and have not had to take it in for repair once since driving it off the lot.  I had heard many horror stories about the old S-10's of the 80's that were constantly in the garage.  This model seems to have a good set of internal organs.

To sum up, the key point is that the Chevy S-10 could use a major boost in engine power or at least an adjustment in the torque to give it a little bit more &quot;uumph.&quot;  If you get the 6 cylinder and want a comfortable, stylish, reliable and satisfying little hauler, it should suit you fine.   <br><br>
