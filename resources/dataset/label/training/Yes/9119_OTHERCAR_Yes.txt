            As much as I love domestic vehicles, there are two things I feel that domestics lack in car markets: economy and luxury. However, in 1995, Oldsmobile came out with a new brand of luxury car: The Aurora. This was to be their top of the line model.

In November of 1999, I got the prime opportunity to own one at a very reasonable price. Dark green, most options, and a 96 model with only 33K highway miles. I took it home for a night and then drove it around some and I was hooked. The next day I went in and did the paperwork for purchasing the car.

After 1 1/2 years of owning this car, I have to say that it is one of the smoothest cars I have driven. The 4.0L, 32 Valve Northstar-based V8 dishes out plenty of high RPM power (250 to be exact) and it quick to be a 4,000 lb car. The acceleration is smooth, however, the weight of the car can sometimes take the car a little longer to accelerate, especially with the engine's high powerband.

To rat off some more numbers, I took a few runs with it at the drag strip: Best time of 15.81@86.5mph. Not too shabby for a car like this. It was definitely better than some of the magazines, only recording a 16.11-16.30.

Handling is surprisingly sports car like and responsive. It can take curves better than most cars in its class.

The interior is very well done, especially for GM. The goodies like electric stuff, are nicely done and work great.

My only cons on this car is that I had a spark plug and plug wire go bad on me. Fortunately, Olds 70,000 mile warranty on emission parts covered it. However, the tires needed replacing. Those things are definitely expensive on the car. I bet I spend $600 putting new tires on it. Another con is the fact that you can only run premium fuel in the Aurora. Anything lower than 91 octane can cause pinging in the engine. If gas prices soar, you don't really have the option on running a lesser octane.

Overall, I am happy with the car, and seeing the past cars I have has been Olds cars, they have all been reliable. I am sure I will get this same kind of quality out of this one.
