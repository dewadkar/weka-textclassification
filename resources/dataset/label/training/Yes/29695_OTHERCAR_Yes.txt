            I bought this vehicle because I liked the look, the luxury and features and price compared to other SUVs in its class. I previously owned a '98 Qx4 and liked that vehicle but did not love it because I felt it lacked in a few areas (mainly in power). The 2001 added all the things I had felt were missing from the older models. It now had good power and pickup, more luxurious and price stayed the same.

So far there are only a few things I would change about it. One of the things I would change is instead of having a CD based Navigation system, have a CD/DVD based system. Currently, the maps for the Navigation system have each section of the country on different CDs. If it was a DVD based system they could get the entire United States on one DVD. Also I would of like to have the added feature of telling mileage, as far as how many miles left on fuel in tank, etc. Most other SUVs and cars for that matter have this feature.

I love everything else about vehicle. The 240 horsepower (versus the 170 on old) made a huge difference on the drive. It now gives it the drive of a big SUV instead of mid-size. The also took care of the noise issue the old one use to have. Its such a quiet and comfortable ride, you forget you're even driving. 

People are of the opinion that because its based on a Pathfinder  (which it is except for the front-end and extra body panels, and the 4 wheel drive all-mode), its not worth the extra cost. However, I beg to defer. I drove both and not sure why they drive different but they do. I found the Infiniti a little more comfortable, and the interior is much nicer. Also I prefer the service/warranty package you get from the Infiniti dealer than from the Nissan dealer.

So if looks aren't a big deal (or you actually like the way the Pathfinder looks better), and maybe you plan on actually doing some 4-wheeling you might want to consider the Pathfinder instead. If you like the extras, and willing to pay the price for them go for the Infiniti. I think being based off of the Pathfinder is not a bad thing. Pathfinder is a solid vehicle, so why not dress it up a little. Other car manufacturers do the same thing, so this is nothing new. I wouldn't recommend the Inifiniti to anyone who plans on doing a great deal of 4 wheeling. Not because it can't handle it (it actually does quite well for the few times I have used it), but because it's too pretty and you're sure to scratch something you don't want to. Besides it looks so out of place. I brought it up to the mountains here, and I got some of the strangest looks.

Other vehicles looked at; I liked the Lexus, just hated the look reminded me of a fat wagon. Did not like the Mercedes SUV, didn't drive as well, and looked like a mini van. Toyota 4-runner Limited Edition, too much money for too little. To me it drove like a truck, and seemed small on the inside, and too pricey for what you got. I didn't look at the Landcruiser, or the BMW. Above the price range I was looking at.


I also did not try any American SUVs. I always seem to have bad luck with American vehicles.
