            I bought my 2000 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport brand new and have just clicked over 50,000 miles.  It came standard with everything except all wheel drive.  A lot of luxury without paying the Town Car price. 

To date the only problem I have had is a small leak a fitting going to the transmission cooler section of the radiator.  Wasn't a cheap fix and it could probably have been left alone for a while longer.

The ride comfort with the captains chairs in the front and mid section seats is wonderful.  The van is very quiet and the Infinity sound system is better than some people have in their homes.  Visibility is almost unlimited no matter where you look.

It is big and white and who would ever believe a large white box would handle so well.  I wouldn't take it full tilt through the hair pin turns on a Colorado mountain, but it does a very respectable job and actually handles much better than most sport sedans from the 80's and 90's.

The seating is very versatile and with everything behind the two front seats removed, you can haul a ton of large items.

The acceleration is pretty good and the only complaint I have is that it kicks out of passing gear a little too soon.  We live in Amish country and when you have to pass horse and buggies, tractors, or the occasional tourist on our winding two lane country roads, I would feel more secure if it kicked out of passing gear at around 85 instead of 75.

The fit and finish are flawless and nothing has started squeaking or rattling yet.  Everything is very snug and tight.

I was looking for another pickup truck when I spotted this on the lot and have never regretted changing my mind.
