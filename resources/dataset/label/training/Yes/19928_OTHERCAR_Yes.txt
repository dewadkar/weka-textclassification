            This Jaguar is possibly the best yet. Until next year. For the next few years, Jaguar is going to change all of their cars, starting with the S-Type. In 2001, they will introduce the X400, a 3-series size car build off the Ford Contour platform. Then they will redesign the XJ8/R. A roadster will probably derive from the X400 and they should all share the style of the S-Type. My point is that in a few years, this won't be the best Jaguar. The other Jaguars will be more unique to the brand. The S-Type is very similar to the Lincoln LS. The S-Type is, structurally, the same car. They have the same engines, with different tweaks, but if you are considering this vehicle, consider the LS too. It is almost as powerful, and cheaper. Some people love Jaguars, and will jump at this car; I understand. It is a great car, it does feel different from the LS, but if your opinion is that they are similar, then go for the LS. They are BOTH great cars. 

Now to talk about the S-Type:
The interior of this car is very serene. It is calming and we throughout. Realistically, if you opt for the Visteon voice-activated controls, it really doesn't matter where the controls are, but they are still in smart positions. The voice-activated controls can operate your climate and radio controls, and a cellular phone- an industry first. 

The optional V-8 engine is a Ward's Auto World &quot;Ten Best.&quot; It is also placed in the LS, but the cylinders are smaller, making the LS version a 3.9L, not a 4.0. Anyway, this engine is powerful, but doesn't give the impression of struggling.

The only problem with this car is the rear headroom. There is none. The cost of the retro-style is no rear headroom in this car. This isn't a reason not buy the car, but it is something to consider if you are tall.

Overall, this is one of the nicest (style, drive) cars on the luxury market. At least give it your consideration.<br><br>
