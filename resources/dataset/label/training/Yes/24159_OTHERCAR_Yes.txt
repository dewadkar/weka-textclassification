            I had been shopping for a new car for about 6 months, and originally had been interested in a Carbon Blue 2002 Elantra GT, but I couldn't find one with the options I wanted (5 speed, no moonroof), so I started looking at other cars, including the Mazda Protege5, and the Vibe/Matrix twins. Having had a trouble-free Protege LX since 94, I was leaning toward the Mazda, but again, one couldn't be found the way I wanted it. One day, while checking my local Hyundai dealer's on-line inventory, lo and behold, a Carbon Blue GT the way I wanted it!

This car is a phenomenal value. The leather seats, moonroof (which I was afraid would kill the headroom for my 6'2" frame), ABS, traction control, CD, airbags, etc, are of a very good quality for what is essentially an econo-box. I love the fact that I don't see another one every time I turn around. What puts me at ease is the amazing warranty (10 year, 100,000 mile powertrain, 5 year/60,000 mile bumper-to-bumper, 5 year/60,000 mile roadside assistance) which means that as long as I have a car payment, I'm covered without having to purchase an extended warranty. As a matter of fact, the dealership didn't even try to sell me one! (When's the last time that happened?) I've had the car for about 2 weeks now, and I'm still finding out neat things about it. My only gripe so far is the break-in period (1200 miles) which at the rate I'm going will take me until Christmas! (I have a short commute to work, so some road trips may be in order!)

I would have no hesitation in heartily endorsing this car to a friend or relative. I had done a lot of research, and so far I feel very comfortable with my decision. I look forward to providing updates in the future.
