            My VW Jetta GLS was the first car that <b>I</b> bought.  I shopped for months and finally decided on the Jetta.  My reasons were, the safety features, the stereo, the gas mileage, the price, and most of all, the look.  The Salesman at the dealership drove me insane, I hung up on him twice through the experience.  But once I got my car I was in love.

The ride is smooth and quiet, my boyfriend (who normally drives a nissan pickup) often catches himself speeding because you really can't feel how fast you are going.  The extras are nice, and with all of the security features my insurance went down.

The negatives I have experienced are:
 *The handle keeps falling off of my glove box
 *This little plastic thing on the floor keeps popping up and roaming around my car
 *Very few CD players are compatable with the Jetta so you either have to get factory installed or buy a very expensive one, either way you cannot get an in dash CD player (at least that's what they tell me)
 *As soon as it got hot, all of this funky goo oozed out of my passenger door and down the side of the car.
 *About 9 months after I bought it, my passenger window motor broke
 *There is a funky rattle in the driver door that I haven't had checked out yet.

The only other negatives I have are in the design of the car: 
  *the cup holders are in an annoying spot on the 5spd and can dump drinks down the stereo and into your air vents if you stop too quickly.  
  *The only way to lean the seats back is by turning an annoying wheel on the side of the seat, there is no quick way to recline.

So far my dealings with the service department have all been favorable.  They fix everything for no charge and are fairly quick about it.  The only negative is that it takes forever to get in.  To get my 10,000 mile check up I had to get an appointment two weeks in advance.

The people I have dealt with have all been friendly and I love my car.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for one.

<b>****UPDATE****</b>
Well I haven't even had the car a year yet... and two days ago I had the pleasure of testing it's durability in a head on 45mph crash.

The Posatives: 
     -Both airbags deployed perfectly
     -The Seatbelt locked exactly as it was supposed to
     -The Jetta held up far better than the 1990 Oldsmobile that I crashed into.
     -I hit at 45mph and the damage to my car looked as if I had only been doing about 10-15.
     -Everyone at the scene commented on how safe my car must be to have held up so well.

The Negatives:
     -Due to the strategic placement of the drink holders, when both airbags deployed they exploded both drinks all over the car.
     -The Anti-theft protection on my stereo fried itself due to the shock because it assumed it was being stolen
     -The powder used in the airbags caused chemical burns to my face, arms and chest and my eyes had to be flushed out.
     -The seatbelt locked so tightly that the cop had to help me unfasten it to get out of the car... I'm glad there wasn't a fire.

I hope this additional information helps.  And just so you know... If they total my poor car... I will be buying another Jetta, if I had been in any other car I most likely would still be in the hospital.

PS- In case you are wondering... it wasn't my fault... the cop said so :)
