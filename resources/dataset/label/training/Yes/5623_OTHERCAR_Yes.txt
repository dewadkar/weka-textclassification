            <p>I have a '03 base Vibe, frosty white, 4 speed auto, power pckg, side airbags, monotone appearance pckg, security pckg, and moons&tunes pckg. Price around $16500. 

<p>I am very happy with it, the handling is excellent (it turns on a dime), I find the seats extremely comfortable (although the driving position is just a little awkward), and it has plenty of space for cargo.

<p>A few problems: I am only getting 24 mpg with mixed city and highway driving however (as opposed to the 30  mpg I expected), the paint seems to be of sub-standard quality (chips, chips, chips), and the interior has some cheap plastic pieces that does my Vibe grave injustice in the looks category. The upgraded stereo system that comes with the moon&tunes pckg actually vibrates anything I keep in storage compartments, which could be a good or bad thing depending on your personality. Field of view for the driver is mediocre, a few things such as the rear windshield wiper and the rear passenger seat headrests interfere with your rear-view vision. Thick plastic columns on either side of the front windshield interfere with vision also. This problem is seen in other cars as well, but for some reason it irks me slightly more to find it in the Vibe. Also, there is no place to rest either elbow while you drive, and the damned seat belt works a little too well---it locks you up if you make a "normal" hard stop. 
 
<p>However, these relatively minor problems don't significantly detract from my overall driving experience. The acceleration is more than adequate for my purposes---the best I've had for a 4 cylinder in fact. I think GM and Toyota did a good job on the engine and tranny. No problems merging lanes on the highway, no problems with the 0 to 60 time either (I don't drag race). Braking is good if a little noisy. Handling is terrific despite the high center of gravity, I make a very tight U-turn at a very busy intersection with no light everyday after work and the Vibe has always delivered.

<p>The dashboard is designed to make you say "cool". Chrome rings and red lighting around the odometer/tachometer/fuel/temp gauge give the impression that you're driving some kind of race car, and the stereo/vent controls are easy to reach and operate. The sound system (extra speakers with the Moon&Tunes option) in my car is more than adequate for my needs, and the bass is incredibly deep and convincing (read: LOUD) when I want it to be. Radio reception is good for both AM and FM frequencies, although any classical music station I attempt to listen to will fizzle and pop like a side of bacon. I hear people have trouble with the shifter on manual transmissions, but no problems here since I have an auto.

<p>You will never run out of cargo space in the car. Ok, maybe you will if you really tried, but then you can just use the cargo rack on the roof of the car. Get the cargo mat though, the plastic "trunk" is very slippery. 

<p>Depreciation is a slightly more serious problem. Toyota's Matrix, which is the Vibe's import twin, will undoubtedly earn better resale value. The Vibe, however, is cheaper to buy due to various rebates and incentives offered by GM and GM dealerships. I saved about $3500 from the $20000 sticker tag on my Vibe with various rebates.
