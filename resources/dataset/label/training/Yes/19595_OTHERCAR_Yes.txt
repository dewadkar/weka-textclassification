            <b>When I bought this Car</b>
I originally bought this car in Dec 99, and I am glad I did. It has so far served me very well. I decided to go with the Saturn SC because of the price and I liked the style of the car. There were many other factors I should have considered but it turns out this car was still a great buy.


<b>Features Available</b>
When buying a car we all would probably like to have all the cool features like sunroof, cd player, alarm, ABS, cruise control etc. Those options are all available but unfortunately will cost a premium. Therefore I bought the standard version. The standard Saturn basically has no features except AM/FM Radio with Cassette Deck,Dual AirBags and Air Conditioning which I could live with. It is fairly roomy in the front but not good for anyone who is too tall. The backseat is equipped with 2 moderately small seats and 2 cupholders in the middle. The cupholders are quite nice, you can fit just about any size cup and not worry about it spilling because of how deep the cupholders are. The backseat is fine for fitting children but when trying to fit larger people you may need to move the front seats up some.


<b>The Engine</b>
The 99 Saturn SC comes with a 1.8 Liter 100 or 124 hp engine depending on which version you select. There is a safety feature that will not allow you to redline the car. This feature is in place on both manual and automatic transmissions. I have the manual version, and the shifting is pretty smooth but it's a pretty long throw between gears. You have to be careful not too let up on the clutch too soon with this one. I have made this mistake a few times.


<b>The Interior</b>
The Interior seems to get dirty quite easily so you need to vacuum this one a lot. You should also wipe down the dash and control panels a lot because they are very prone to get dirty more so than other cars. I'm not sure why but this car likes dirt. Another downside of this car is the fact that the internal hardware is annoying and unstable. The Seat Levers and SeatBelts are very hard to reach. The lever for reclining the seat is stuffed into a small area where there is still space left on the side of the seat and after using all your might to get the lever up the seat goes flying back. This feature needs major work. I have scratched my hand several times this way. The Seatbelts work fine once you can finally get them on. The Interior Dome Light has gotten loose and only works when the right parts fall into place. This seems to happen on All Saturn SC's.

 
<b>Driving</b>
The car is moderately quiet on the highway. As quiet as you will get from a sports car anyway. The a/c takes a couple minutes to cool down but it's not too bad if you roll the windows down for 2 minutes or so. The car drives pretty smoothly for it's make and price. You shouldn't have too much of a problem but slow down even for small bumps or railroad tracks.

<b>Safety</b>
This car is a pretty safe car believe it or not. I was sitting at a stoplight when someone was busy making an illegal left turn and hit me head on with their GMC Pickup. I expected to find the car totally smashed up but when I came out there was just a couple of minor scratches even though the other car suffered noticeable damage. Perhaps my car was spared due to the fact that I was at a dead stop but I was still impressed. Luckily the AirBag did not deploy so I can not comment on this feature. perhaps it is bad that it did not deploy. I hope it would work if I were God Forbid in a more serious accident or anyone else was.

<b>Who Should Buy This Car</b>
I do not think anyone with kids should buy this Car because it has Dual AirBags and kids like to sit in the front seat, plus this is not really a family car. It is good for single folks who have a moderate amount of money and would like to drive a fairly safe sports car at a fairly low price. If you are rich you can get something much better but for the rest of us Saturn is a decent buy.
