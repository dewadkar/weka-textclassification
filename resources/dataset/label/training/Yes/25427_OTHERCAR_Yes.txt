            we were greeted by a very friendly salesman. He didn't try to pressure us into buying anything; he just told us to take a look around and if we needed anything that he would be glad to help. We told him that we wanted to take a look at the 3-door models, and he took us into the showroom where they were located. He told us a little about the car and its features. We liked what we saw, so I test drove one of the cars. The car was really nice and it handled well. The ride was very quiet and smooth. There is easy access to all the controls. When we arrived back at the Saturn dealership, we decided that we would buy the car. The salesman helped us fill out all the paperwork, and he even helped in finding us an insurance company. The people are very friendly at Saturn and they don't pressure you into anything.
The only thing that dissapoints me about the car is that it's very cramped in the back. The seats are really small, and there is a cup holder in the middle, which makes the back even smaller and uncomfortable. The cup holders in the front of the car are also very small. Also, there isn't that much power in the car. Like most teenagers, I like to drive fast. I usually have to floor it to get anywhere quickly. It takes about 13 seconds to get from 0-60 mph.
