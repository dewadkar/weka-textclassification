            <b>Recently I went minivan hunting and of coarse I went to Toyota, Honda, and ford but I also went to Kia. I have to admit I was A little skeptical of buying from a carmaker thatï¿½s always cheap and not to mention this being Kia's first minivan for them to make but I was really impressed with Kia.

THE RIDE
The ride is smooth and comfortable. It glides from o-60 in about 9 seconds which good for a minivan. As far as acceleration it has fast pick up from 0-50 then levels out nice and smooth for a nice comfortable ride.

MIS.
Well the heating and cooling is right in the center of the dash and is idiot proof. Also Kia put in front and back climate control. They have power windows and mirrors. They have an ample amount of cup holders. It also has two glove compartments one big and a smaller one, and a compartment under the seat the locks.   

Space
The new Kia has a small amount of cargo space but you can easily take out the two rear seats. One down fall is that that it does not have very much head clearance and make's it difficult for taller people. But on the other hand you have lots of leg room.
And if your looking for a good time to buy a car the time is now.<b>
