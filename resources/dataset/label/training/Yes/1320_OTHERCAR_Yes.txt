            I have had two Honda Passports over the last 7 years, they both have had 4-wheel drive, which is an excellent feature if you live where their is snow or mountain areas. The vehicle does go through the snow without any difficulty and hugs the mountain roads in which I live like you would not believe. My husband &quot;thought&quot; about getting a car next but after driving our Passport where we have, he has decided this particular vehicle will stay with us for a long time. They are worth every penny you pay, they are constructed very well with reinforcement steel, are great for trips, and ride very comfortable. I would never give up my Passport, they are a very good investment and will last a long time with recommended service as per other vehicles, so next time you are out looking do try out The Honda Passport, you will not be disappointed! The only time it has been to a shop was for simple recall parts, and that has only been twice!<br><br>
