            So, why would you want a Saturn? Well, they&#146ve always been very reliable cars&#133 it&#146s not unusual at all to see one push 200,000 miles before giving out. They are inexpensive to own &#150 insurance rates are lower, fuel mileage is excellent, and they don&#146t usually need a lot of repairs. There are some lemons out there, of course&#133 but for reliability, I would trust a Saturn more than a lot of other cars. Safety is another plus&#133 I have seen many cases where a Saturn has been in a horrendous accident and its driver has walked away unscathed. The polymer body panels won&#146t absorb much of an impact, but the space frames in the cars do a very good job of protecting their passengers.

They are well-built and they look great. Mine still has its original 8-year-old paint job, and it practically looks brand new. I get compliments from just about everyone who works with it, because it looks great both inside and out. Since it has a polymer body, most of it can&#146t rust or dent. In most places, the service is exceptional. Its quality will vary from one Saturn dealership to the next, but for the most part they are comfortable environments with a lot of really friendly people. I&#146ve never been to a dealership I didn&#146t like, and I&#146ve never had any problems at all with their service.

Saturns are pretty comfortable inside, considering their price. The controls are all very easy to get to (with the exception of the rear window switches) and they all have a nice tactile feel to them. The ride is pretty good for a car that is so low to the ground, and the seats are fairly comfortable. I&#146m more than six feet tall, and I have no problem at all fitting into my sedan. The engine is fairly noisy, yes&#133 but, truthfully, I consider that a pro, not a con. It&#146s nice to hear the power growling under there.

&#147Power in a Saturn?&#148 I can hear you asking. Well, the engine doesn&#146t have a whole lot of horsepower, but it&#146s well designed and it has a pretty good kick to it. With the automatic transmission, you can flip a switch to use performance mode, which gives you a lot more power for passing on the highway or just having fun. You won&#146t win any races against a Ferrari, but for a 4-banger that gets 35 miles to the gallon, it doesn&#146t do bad at all.

Overall, I would recommend a Saturn to just about anyone who&#146s looking for something in that price range. They&#146re a lot of fun to own, and they won&#146t take a big chunk out of your wallet. You won&#146t get much luxury, but you&#146ll get a car you can trust.
