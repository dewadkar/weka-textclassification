            I am one of those obsessive researchers of any product before I buy, and I made no exception for my car purchase.  I am also a big cheapskate.  Consumer Reports and several other publications highly recommend this car -- it is basically the cheapest of the highest rated cars, as long as you buy the 95 or up model.  

I have had the car about a year now, and I am satisfied with it.  It's the basic model and had 60K on it, and it is obvious now that the person traded it in so he/she wouldn't have to do the 60K maintenance, which is about what you would expect, so I paid for the new timing belt, etc.  I am now a little worried about the brakes.  There was a serious (manual) transmission problem which was fortunately covered by my warranty (probably a $800 repair).  The shifting from 2nd to 3rd was grinding in a really nasty way, but seems to be fine now.

The car runs great, gets good mileage, and really looks brand new because the styling is so attractive.  The stereo sounds really good, although I was annoyed to discover I had a security system that kicks in when my battery died and had a heck of a time calling around trying to get information on how to get my radio to work again since I did not program the original code.  The cup holder is a handy feature but doesn't hold much other than small cans or coffee cups.  As others mention, the trunk is roomy, although the back seat is not particularly spacious.  The A/C works fine and no electrical problems so far.

There have been several small annoyances that I didn't realize were the Prizm's fault until I read several other reviews.  The locks are a pain -- they don't open smoothly either by key (they grind a lot) or even by hand (you have to really yank on them).  I have had headlight knobs come loose and it seems like the headlights do not illuminate much of the space in front of the car, forcing me to use my brights sometimes when I would rather not.  My driver side window easily bumps open enough to become noisy so I have to re-close it several times in a trip.

I got a great deal on this car and would recommend it to others, especially those who want reliability at a really decent price.  The price is really reasonable for what you get, and much cheaper than just about any other similar car.  Not fancy, but does the job very well.<br><br>
