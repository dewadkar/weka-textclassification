            Having used 35mm SLRs for 20+ years, we decided to make the move to digital - slowly. We started in digital with an earlier, 2.3mp model of Kodak a year ago to decide if it was worth the move. The advantages were well worth it - so we made a big jump to the Canon Digital Rebel ($1,000 worth of 6mp - and fantastic). What we missed was the compact size and ease of use with the little Kodak, and found that we needed two cameras, anyway.  

The choice for the Kodak DX6490 was fairly simple - it was based primarily on the 10x optical zoom, which was needed for the focal quality with versatility of shooting range. We are freelance photographers, and have some markets that allow us to use the format size of the Kodak. It's so small that it's sometimes difficult to keep a grip on (especially if your hands are very cold!), but we can take it along anywhere without the bigger camera bag so it's on hand for those great "opportunity shots" that we might otherwise miss. Being used to the old SLRs and even the Canon digital, the Kodak has a very small grip which isn't so bad for my small hands, but could use a more textured grip area for a better hold, especially in very cold or less than ideal weather conditions.  

The program options are fewer but very similar to those on the Canon; we find most of the work we do is best in the "action" mode to gain greater shutter speed (which also helps overcome any camera shake), though the full automatic setting is very good.     

The focus factor is tedious sometimes - on occasions it can fixate the focus bars, but you have to watch for the AF blinking light, indicating that it's NOT able to autofocus. Usually this is caused by being too close to the subject, zooming in too far (can't do some of the close-ups I want to), or lack of sufficient contrast in the focal area. Additionally, in the moments it takes to lock focus on, sometimes the subject has moved (animals, children, etc.), but it is as quick as any other digital camera of it's price range or lower that I've tried (which is a bunch). Recovery time for the next shot is tedious, but it's quicker than the older digitals.  

We found it was easiest to experiment, rather than try to read the manual all at once and then work with it - there's just too much to absorb at once. Once the photos are downloaded, it's easy enough to see what works and what doesn't, pitch the bad ones, and go back and try more! With the minor investment of an extra memory card or two, it's easy enough to take the same shot in different program modes to determine what works best for you.

The camera came with a charging dock, where it stays when not in use. Unless you're using the flash for most all shots, we've had no problem with the battery lasting as long as the memory card has space. We were concerned, though, that as of this date we have found no replacement battery available (even from Kodak).  We hope this doesn't become a problem. 

For the price, we found this to be a terrific little camera that would stand up to the comparable units (few as they are). .
