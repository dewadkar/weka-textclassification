            Upon inspecting my brand new, 95� Ford Contour LX, the diehard Chevrolet man (who was dating my friend Vienna at the time) inquired why I had bought this lumpy new Ford when I could have bought a better Chevy? I replied to him simply that Chevrolet, or GM for that matter, was not, at the time building a small, inexpensive, sedan that could match wits with the Europeans. He quickly sighted a half dozen cars that would fit the bill, and not wanting to insight passions, I relented that there were other possibilities out there. There were, of course, though, not. When I thought about the rattley door slams, buzzy Quad 4 engines, sub par ergonomics, and ferocious torque steer, I shuddered at the notion that GM�s sedan offerings might be suitable competition for Fords new taught, European Contour. While things have changed at GM in the last six years (though I am still waiting for a good V6-5-speed combo), at the time, those considering a 3 Series or a Maxima had little reason to visit a GM dealer.

At the time, though, GM was pushing its continuously improving Saturn line. Still no competition, but good things were on the way.  The Saturn project dates back to 1982 when a new small car initiative was launched, and code-named �Saturn� after the NASA spacecraft from the Apollo Missions, not the planet. In January of 1985, Saturn, who�s development would ultimately top a whopping $3.5 billion, became a Corporate subsidiary in the General Motors family. Headquarters was set up in Troy, Michigan, and an advanced, four million square foot manufacturing facility was developed in Spring Hill, Tennessee. Prototypes were created, and new methods of production and sales were considered. When Saturn came to market with cars in October of 1990, a rather new concept was born. With the failure of Geo, GM was in dire need of something fun, economical, and profitable to offer up to the bumper crop of Generation X kids that were getting their driver�s licenses and dragging their parents to new car showrooms. Three sedans and one coupe were initially offered. The sedan came in three trim levels, the coupe in one. All were powered by 1.9 liter, single and dual overhead cam, four cylinder engines. Horsepower was 85 and 124, respectively. Base model coupe and wagon varieties followed in 1993. Saturn dealers were bright, clean, and very professional. Also, no haggling was needed as the price stated was the price paid, just like most typical consumer products. Buying the cars was a breeze through no pressure sales and committed customer service. Also, as shown in television commercials, a big to-do was made when you got the keys to your new Saturn. Behind the scenes, the cars were being co-developed, somewhat jointly between upper management, the design/engineering staff, and UAW. It wasn�t long after the first SL1, red in color, rolled off the line that the recalls began. The first was a simple coolant problem. Saturn feared that in time, the cooling system could be damaged by overly caustic chemicals and offered free replacement cars to buyers. The industry was stunned and the inconvenienced owners walked out of service departments still smiling. It seemed like a terribly good concept, and it was, except for one small, but seemingly important element; the cars themselves. I have driven or ridden in at least a dozen various Saturns and the experience, up until the relatively new L Series, was always disappointing. The first few model years were especially bad. 

To begin with, it doesn�t seem that anyone was sure of what the Saturns should look like.  With the SL�s, the nose was rather Geo Storm, while the remainder of the car, especially the rear window, seemed lifted almost exactly from the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. The SC1, seemed like a Geo Storm altogether, and the performance oriented SC2 was like a Pontiac Sunbird with the SC1 tail and a strange 300ZX/Olds Toronado compilation grafted onto the front. Behind the wheel the problems were even worse. Frankly, I would have rather been run down by these cars as that would have been less painful than having to drive them. The seatbacks, front and especially rear, were so hard and vertical that Saturn should have included the card of a good chiropractor in the owner�s manual. Anyone who believes that his or her SC2 is a sports coupe would gain some perspective with a few moments behind the wheel of a Honda Prelude.The twin cam sedans suffered from similar sports sedan envy. The engines, multi overhead cam or not, were incredibly weak and harsh. You have seen the commercials where Jonathan Price balances a five-tier pyramid of champagne glasses on the hood of a running Infiniti? Well, one champagne glass couldn�t make it with the Saturns, even if it were on the floor, ten feet away. The automatic hunted and pecked for what seemed like always the wrong gear, and the 5-speed felt like a broom handle, shifting through a bucket of balls. The plastic bodies creaked and rattled under duress, while the skinny tires and narrow rear track allowed the tail to wobble all over the pavement in evasive maneuvers.

Still, though, for a rather new company, the products showed insight and potential.  Interior textures leaned toward the quality side and trunk space was adequate. Styling improved in subsequent years and great new colors and options were added. Innovation even followed for the 1999 model year, when Saturn Coupes (built after early November 1998) featured a brilliant, driver�s side rear access door. If you had anything less than a feather touch on the clutch, you may be replacing motor mounts before 100k, but otherwise the cars were fairly reliable. In fact, possibly the most notable virtue has been in the way the cars have held up. Look around at the early 90�s Saturns that are still on the road.  Design work has aged gracefully, and allowed the cars to even still seem contemporary.  I have seen those jerky engines hit the 150,000-mile mark with little repair. The dent and corrosion resistant plastic panels (except on the roof, hood, and deck lid) have allowed the bodies to stay factory fresh. A friend just sold her 94 SC1 with 100k on the clock and it still looked new from as close as two feet. 

Let us now fast forward to the year 1999. Saturn has brought it�s existing product line a long way in terms of quality and design. However, in the auto industry, you need a car to step up into when those Gen X kids become twenty three year old professionals with $50k, dot-com driven, annual salaries burning holes in their pockets. If they fell in love with the little SL they had in college, it didn�t matter, because there was simply nothing to upgrade to. And Saturn didn�t want this important demographics eye to wander. This is where the mid-sized L Series comes in. GM needed this new, premium offering to keep buyers loyal, and try to turn around sliding Saturn sales figures (which had been dropping in annually increasing amounts since a 1995 peak of 285,000 units). Since GM also has interests in Opel of Germany and Saab of Sweden, a natural product development relationship ensued. Saab also needed a new car at this time to replace its ancient 9000 series, and Opel had a parent platform ready to go. 

True Saab people, I mean the ones that are loyalists to Saab�s sometimes strange, counterculture appeal, can become rather touchy when the 9-5 is referred to as a rebadged German Opel. And they certainly do not like being told that a similar driving experience can be had in a Saturn for half the price. Saturn loyalists on the other hand should be quite pleased that the new L shares some lineage with a notable German performance sedan and the newest thing from Saab. Actually, despite what some car guys may tell you, the L (and 9-5) are only rather loosely based on the Opel Vectra and even more loosely related to one another. In fact, the parts that are directly lifted are mostly plastic clips. �Loosely based�, however, does mean that both cars incorporate some modified technology that aren�t counted in badge engineering exercises (by definition). For example, suspension work and platform stampings are all somewhat related, but heavily modified. Also, the 60 degree, 3.0 litter V6 is shared by the L, 9-5, and even Cadillac Catera are all fundamentally the same unit, designed by Vauxhall (another GM subsidiary) in England. In each car, however, the engines have been substantially modified. The Cadillac�s is positioned for rear drive and the Saab employs it�s own fuel delivery and turbo systems, while the Saturn putters on with normal aspiration. 

The trained automotive eye can see that the L Series looks a bit like the Vectra. It does however, employ it�s own Saturn characteristics in the nose and tail. Plus, the fenders, door panels, and bumper fascias reflect Saturn�s trademark Polymer fabrication. Because of the plastic front fenders, designers were able to cut in slim turn signals very tightly. They are sleek, but I wish they tapered into the bottom of the headlamp unit, rather than it�s midpoint � not very smooth. Saturn�s trademark, upswept mid bodyline is more subtle and stylish than on the SL series. The belt line and upper body creasing enforce the wedge shape nicely. As spoilers were initially adopted, back in the 60�s, to create better traction, through down force, on rear drive racecars; I feel that front drive family cars have no business, utilizing them. They are usually decorative, adding only weight and cost. However, I find the L�s optional spoiler (as fake-speed effects go) to be an attractive end to the tidy tail. Plastic wheel covers and several aluminum rims are offered. While they are all smart, a nice set of dramatic, multi-spoke rims would give the car a more sporting flavor. The rear track is nice and wide, lending an aggressive stance, and I like the fat, chrome exhaust tip. The color palette is a bit drab, but the whole look of the car, while lacked for drama, is very smart, clean, and sophisticated.  Also, in case you haven�t picked it up yet, the L seems to follow the similar styling and body composition formula of the SL, and in my opinion, will likely age with equal poise.

The interior of the L is quite attractive and comfortable. The standard cloth fabric is pleasing to the touch, and the tip-sheared carpeting exhibited a quality level of pile density. The optional leather interior is where the action is, though. Hides are used on the seating surfaces and in small amounts on the door panels. This is especially helpful, as without the cow skin, interior door panels look a bit cheap. While I like the feel of the leather, it is visibly and tactily obvious where the real stuff is joined with look-alike vinyl trim. As long as we�re on the subject of low-end faux pas� the L�s interior has an interesting quirk. The leather/vinyl combo and surrounding interior elements seem to look rather classy when the interior is rendered in dark shades. When ordered in neutral hues, it comes off like a sub-par, trendy pretender. Strange indeed. The dash is stylish and easy to use (Saturn lineage is evident, especially in the instrument cluster). My only real gripe is the traction control button light, which stays on when the system is activated, working or not. The green light is bright and annoying, especially from the back seat.  As the traction control should remain on during all situations, (as a safety measure), I believe that this warning should work in the reverse, illuminating only to remind the driver to reactivate the system. Interior room is comfortable in the back seat, but offers less legroom than the Accord or Camry. Also, as typical with Saturns, the rear seatback is a bit steep. In addition, I have a serious complaint concerning the center rear armrest. It slopes forward too much and seems to rest on the seat instead of stopping on it�s own. This makes it give too much and lends a feeling of instability. It is also too low to really lean on. The integrated cupholders are foam reinforced vinyl instead of hard plastic and not only look cheap, but are positioned too far back to get your entire fore arm behind the cup you are drinking from (at least I did, I am 6�2� tall). Trunk space, however, is terrific at 17.5 cubic feet and the lid cuts into the tail section deeply enough to allow for a reasonably low liftover height.

Saturn�s new 2.2 liter aluminum engine is a great leap forward in GM, four cylinder engine technology (this engine will be doing duty in many GM ventures, worldwide).  The iron-lined block was cast in an all-new, GM specific technique. The 16-valve design also features coil on plug ignition and twin balance shafts. The resulting 137 horsepower and 147 usable pound feet of torque are delivered smoothly through a 5-speed, Saab transmission, or a new GM 4-speed automatic. Saturn was also able to achieve low emissions vehicle status with this engine, without the use of an annoying EGR valve, (which frequently need maintenance before the 100k mile mark). The three-liter V6, which produces 182 horsepower and 190 pound feet of torque, is available with the automatic only. I have experienced both engines and can honestly say that they are incredibly subdued, almost to the point where you want to check the seatbelt buckle to see if you are indeed in a compact GM car. The V6 delivers torquey acceleration. By this I mean to say, that it feels like a secure whoosh of thrust instead of the rev-driven power of some small sports sedans. It is a good feeling; I only wish that I could feel it with the 5-speed transmission. The 2.2-liter motor is equally smooth, but with the automatic, feels a bit bogged while getting the hefty, 2900 pound L from 0-60. Still, with the auto/4-cylinder, the deed is done in just under ten seconds. Shift-it-yourself fans can skip the automatic and that figure can become a competitive 8.7 seconds.  I have found solid data indicating that the V6/automaic duo can pull 0-60 in 8.2 seconds, though some reliable sources have relayed to me that playing with down shifts through clever pedal modulation can get that number into the very high 7�s. Again, if a manual option were offered with this engine, that number could drop into the mid to low 7�s.

The Saturn, like the Saab is larger than the compact Vectra in almost every way. A longer wheelbase seems to help facilitate a better ride, as I have heard Vectras tend to sacrifice comfort for cornering. Indeed, I would classify the L as having a comfortable, touring suspension ride, suitable for back roads and highway travel alike. The Vectra�s suspension and brake systems have been lifted for use in the L almost verbatim. Up front, gas struts and control arms are mounted to a sub frame. The multilink rear is fully independent, employing upper and lower control arms mixed with trailing arms and coil over gas shocks. All models feature anti-roll bars.  The L seems to understeer slightly in corners, meaning that the nose pulls the car too far into turns. Also, it seems to wallow a bit in the twisties and during rapid, low speed changes. Here, the L is very different from the tightly sprung Vectra, as spring rates, bushings, and shock damping have all been tuned for the more ride conscious American market. But L Series doesn�t protest being tossed about, feeling almost sporty. Steering gain, or the manner in which the tires catch up to steering input, was remarkable smooth and progressive, and while it�s not quite an Accord, the body structure felt very solid, and the cabin quiet. 

The L Series began life as the LS Series, but quickly dropped the �S�. I imagine that Saturn caved to pressure from Lincoln or even Lexus, as both also have an �LS� model. Just suspicion on my part, though. Thusly, the premium Saturn is being offered in three flavors. The first is the entry level L100, which bases in the mid teens. Next is the L200, which offers more luxury features, but the same driveline options. For the six cylinder, one must move up to the L300, which tops out around $25,000. All three levels are being pushed heavily as a family car, or a sports sedan. Television commercials reflect this by showing the L as very safe, or fast, depending on which one you see. Magazine ads make sure to put families by the L and even go so far as to say that their �ad family� upgraded to the L in conjunction with having a third child. Anyone with three kids should avoid even the wagon and start pricing a Chevy Venture, as the L is hardly suitable for travel with even the two young teens pictured in the ad (let alone with extra baby and assorted baby supplies). Also, as the L300 sports sedan floats around the $25k mark, this puts it dangerously into Passat, and Maxima territory. While these sedans may be slightly more expensive, they are true sports sedans offering well developed handling characteristics, and sultry V6 engines with available 5-speeds. The two L�s that I drove (an L100 and L300) belonged to young, professional women that could see a baby in their future. Neither one had any aspirations to be an enthusiast on the road and neither does much traveling or people hauling by car. The 100 was a 4-cylinder/automatic combo, while the 300 had the V6. This type of buyer seems to be a bit more in line with who Saturn should be sending their advertising dollars to.  I drove both cars under freeway, city, and back road conditions and felt very confident in all situations. 

The bottom line is this: I was quite impressed with the L, as a Saturn, and as a car in general. Saturn has come a long, long way and is truly offering a near world class car for a very reasonable asking price. It features all of the usual new safety and luxury options in this price class including reduced force airbags, curtain airbags, ABS, and daytime running lights. Plus, it offers enough quality, performance, and style to be a worthwhile consideration on your way to whatever Japanese dealer you see fit. The L even shares some heritage with well-respected German and Swedish road cars at up to half the price. Let us also not forget the painless buying and servicing experience. Unfortunately, though, the L is a bit in over it�s head in this class that includes some similarly priced family and performance sedans that have secured themselves as household words. When introduced, the L Series was considered a launch disaster, eclipsed only now by the epic failure of the Pontiac Aztek. Initially, GM was unrealistically planning to move 500,000 units annually. That figure then dropped to an optimistic 200,000, then a reality induced 167,000. Unfortunately, less than half of that figure have found homes, annually, since then. I have heard rumors that the styling of the nose is under heavy scrutiny and will be quickly revisited (quick for GM, I mean). People are coming around, though, as sales are very slowly picking up and word that the L has something to offer is getting to the streets. My fear is that even with all the baked-in goodness the L Series has to offer, in a world of super-fly Nissan�s, dramatically styled Chrysler�s, and ultra-suede Honda�s, nobody is really going to care. You should though.
