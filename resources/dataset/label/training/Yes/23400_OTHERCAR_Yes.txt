            I love my 1997 Nissan King Cab!  I do know, however that the King Cabs do have one problem.  The balance goes bad more quickly than it should after paying to have it balanced, even when taken to the Nissan dealership.  My roommate has had the same problem with her 1997 King Cab.  The result is uneven wear on the tires.

Otherwise the truck is fun to drive.  I have yet to get into a situation I cannot get myself out of and it isn't for a lack of trying.  I would have preferred a six-cylinder, but as it turns out, the four-cylinder is fine.  I live in Montana and we get some excellent conditions for four wheel drive and it is fun to do in my 1997 King Cab.  I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for a truck.  I would not recommend this truck to anyone looking for a back seat in a truck as this is not roomy and can be dangerous in a roll-over.  I bought this truck because of it's affordability.<br><br>
