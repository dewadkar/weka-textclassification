            I bought a 91 ford escort. Best car i ever owned. There wasn't much room in the back at the time but i had small children and it suited me perfect.  The gas miliage at the time i thought was very good, considering i use to travel over 100 miles a day, round trip, to work and didn't spend that much on gas. The car held the road pretty good, although i've had better. It was a hatchback and I had plenty of room in the back to go on trips with my family. I had it the shop twice a year for routine maintenance. the car held up very good. I put 110,000 miles on it.<br><br>
