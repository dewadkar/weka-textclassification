            This little convertible from Mercedes truly defines the virtues of a true convertible as it combines luxury, performance, and value(even if the base MSRP is priced at $41000, it will definitely be worth it!).  First, I couldn't decide whether I wanted a convertible or a coupe since a convertible delivers fun, open-top vibrance while it lacks the sense of security the coupe possesses.  My prayers have finally been answered, since Mercedes-Benz introduced the thoughtful hard top convertible in 1998.  After I got my hands behind a '99 SLK, I was amazed at how quickly and smoothly the secure, steel hardtop just folded itself into the trunk.  And may I also add, the whole process took less than 30 seconds.  Then I shifted to first gear as the supercharged I4 engine hummed a pleasant exhaust note.  I was satisfied but couldn't get over wondering how much it would be better if it was a six, which would better suit this kind of car.        
The car offers great luxury also, having premium Bose audio system, power        
retractable hardtop, and dual climate controls all included in the standard division. So take my advice and test drive a SLK for your self as  I guarantee it will be &quot;love at first sight&quot;.<br><br>
