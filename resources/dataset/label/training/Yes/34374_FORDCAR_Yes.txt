            Last Year my wife and I were shopping for a car. One that we could count on. My wife was ahem with child in oven. :-) Well to make a long story short, We hopped all around tried all different dealers and had basically decided to give up. That's when we came across our 98 Taurus. This car was handsomely stylish &quot;Way too expensive&quot; we thought. Well we were wrong We got our Taurus with 18,000 miles on it still under warrantee for $12,000.

This car has muscle, a powerful V6, economy, we get around 24 MPG on the highway and 19-20 in the City, a great ride. Very easy power steering. six speaker radio nice sound quality either high or low volume. and the best of all was the way we have been treated at different Ford dealerships even after our warrantee has expired.

Now no review is complete without mentioning what needs to be improved. The Ford is wide and round but this seems to cause a major blind side towards the rear passenger side. I have had on a few occasions and angry horn honked at me. The turning radius I find to be not full enough. Even on very wide roads it seems like all you can muster is a broken u-turn. And last, they really had a difficult time with a recall for for faulty gas tank and gauge readings. Mine took three attempts and one time of running out of gas while my gauge read half a tank left, before they got the right combination in.. <br><br>
