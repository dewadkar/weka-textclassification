            I have been using mine for a few months now and have lots of good feelings about the purchase.  The FD-88 does have a few quirks I have to get used to.

The Zoom is terrifficc!   The display shows the slider on the screen with a line quickly and easily whether it is OPTICAL OR DIGITAL ZOOM.

It really does help.  Your picture quality on the image is lost as you move into the digital area.  If you want more than the 72 for web display you must know the area where you can stretch the functions of the camera to capture the image.

Being able to do more selective picture taking have great advantages and saves disk space (both in the camera and at home)

I like the Floppy diskette data saves.  Just need to write onto the surface of the floppy with a pencil.

Warning - If you are trying to capture fast action the camera has a delay as you push the shutter button it does a sample then takes the picture.  Delay is noticeable.  But it is a knack that can be learned.  or maybe I can change more settings. 

Big Plus - The menu has a common interface than is easy and workable.  Love that part.  Nice design points for that bit of programming and the use of a good rocker switch nicely placed.

One thing I have noticed is the better color and focus.  I have used a few others and did carry a Epson high end one for a little while.   While I miss the smaller size of that one I do like the FD-88

PS Motion for up to 60 seconds is fun!  Pan the room at a party etc.<br><br>
