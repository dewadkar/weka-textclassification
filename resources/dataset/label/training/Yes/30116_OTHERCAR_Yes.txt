            We recently purchased a 1995 Dodge Stratus, and from what we have seen so far it is really a great car. It has plenty of room for us and our 2 children, and they love it too. It has many extra features which makes it a great family car, and a safe car. And that was a big selling point for us. We needed a bigger car, and my husband just wasn't ready to go to the mini-van yet(but some day I will talk him into it).

The car lot that sold us the car was very nice, which really helped because it has been a long and hard struggle for us trying to get financing. He worked with our price range and agreed to many things that we asked for. It is hard when you don't have a lot of money, or can't get financing to go and purchase a brand new car, but to us, this car looks brand new. And so far, runs like a brand new car.

I would recommend this car to anyone who is wanting a family car, and a car that runs great, and looks sharp. And in today's world, doesn't cost a fortune to fill up the tank with gas. (Because we all know what gas prices are today!)

So if you are looking for a second car, or you just don't want a brand new car, and are looking for something used, why not check out a Dodge Stratus, you won't be disopointed.<br><br>
