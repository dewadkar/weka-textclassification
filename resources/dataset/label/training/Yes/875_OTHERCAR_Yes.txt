            All right...everybody knows that Olympus makes a great little camera, but they've outdone themselves on this one and its big brother (See my review of the 3030, which is essentially the same comes with Adobe Photoshop Ltd. 5.0 and has a faster burst shooting capability).

I am getting BEAUTIFUL shots - same quality as the 3030, but saved a bundle!  A truly GREAT camera and a great value, but you HAVE to spend a good deal of time with the manual before you'll be able to take FULL advantage of all the 3000 has to offer.  With 3.34MP, you get great detail, but -- as with the 3030 -- I've found the learning curve to be, well, shall I say &quot;a little steep&quot;?

Aside from that, though, what fabulous prints! Great flesh tones, sharp sharp sharp 8x10's and very good larger prints! You'll love being able to shoot wide and be able to crop and enlarge!  Love it...

Olympus clearly thought out placement of controls and what this unit lacks in terms of ease of learning curve, it makes up for in EVERYTHING else.

Automatic bracketing...great! No more leaving important shots to chance with one over and one under the &quot;normal&quot; exposure. (Again...saving my bacon!)

I also like the unit's auto AND manual focus, selectable shutter speeds, slow flash sync, and multi-patterned white balance feature. 

Shadow detail in px is great and the 3x OPTICAL zoom is a nice lens range. Color is vibrant across the range...but as I said earlier, the speed at which you can take pictures (Burst rate) is a bit slower than on the 3030...but who cares, unless you're an avid stop action sports photographer.  Plus, the thing has QuickTime movie capture onboard, just like the 3030!

Great camera...but brace yourself to spend a little time with the manual!

If you want most of the features and a better price, check my review of the Olympus 3000 model --- which is exactly the same except...well, see &quot;SAVING AND ENJOYING!&quot; at the Olympus 3000 review section.
