            The E-10 poses a big choice..Spend 1999.00 for an excellent camera or just spend another grand for the 35 digital Cannon EOS D30 Professional Camera..

Yes, the Professional cameras and the consumer cameras are beginning to merge as far as price range goes. As great as the E-10 is, the Pro 35 digital cams like Nikon and Cannon are still better yet.

It comes down to this, if you want to save a few bucks, buy the E-10, If you make income from your photos, go up the next level to the Cannon or Nikon Digi 35. 

But back to the E-10, it's a fabulous camera, feels good and shoots faster than most of us will ever need. All photos are sharp with only a little background noise noticeable. What kills me is how Olympus prices it's wide angle lenses and other accessories so high...They know you have no other choice than to buy from them, so they really stick it to you.

It's now Jan. 2002, and I have used this camera on about 100 jobs and it's time to update this review...

The E-10 is now priced about 1499, which is a great deal and about 1000 less than the Canon D30. 

Would I buy an E-10 again??? Probably not, and these are the reasons:

ISO only goes to 320, which is good, but not fast enough for indoor sports without a flash. The D30 goes up to ISO 1600.

Low light focus is difficult, I get a lot of out of focus shots with and without the flash.

The E-10 can only record 4 images at once, and the buffer fills up fast...

The pop up flash used with the lens hood sometimes throws a shadow on the image in wide angle mode

The image review feature is slow and LCD live view is low resolution.

I do love the manual zoom ring, feels great and is noiseless.

This camera is build solid, feels good in your hands..Works flawlessly with my Macintosh.
