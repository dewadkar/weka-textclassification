            this car is awesome,especially at speeds of up to 100+ mph.switching lanes is a breeze at this speed(people with heart problems should not try this,  risk of heartattack is imminent)not that i've tried.i bought this vehicle because i didnt like anything else on the road. you see maybe 20 honda civics a day . but this car is a head turner. even in its stock underpinnings.imagine what a few exterior mods would do.better yet imagine what a turbo and intake upgrade would do.                                      what i love about this vehicle is that it has a unique look, it drives great, performs great, and would kick some ass with a few mod's.         the only problems i've had were the breaks. thats about it so far        Too drive this car is fun. you can take it on any (flat)roadsurface, it laughs at the rain, and it corners good.i suggest taking it to its limits whenever you can.                                                         dont drive this car if your used to driving geo metros or big suburbans.<br><br>
