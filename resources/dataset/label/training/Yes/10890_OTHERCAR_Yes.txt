            I bought this truck because (a) I was disgusted with my Toyota Corolla, and (b) My friend owned a Jeep Comanche a year older, with a manual, and a 4.0L engine. We both bought ours used.  To me it was a really fun truck to drive, and to him as well.  I really love that this vehicle has a 4.0L engine in it.  It has lots of torque, and has plenty of horsepower. It's reliable, I have 104 thousand on it, started without hesitation in -10 degree weather.  I also like that it's rare, not many people have them, and they are slowly fading away.  And I still have mine.  I don't like that the brakes had to be replaced twice in one year, though.  And that it's not 4X4, however Jeep did produce them.  Personally, I'd have liked a Manual, more fun to drive, and higher gear ratio (faster acceleration).  It's a pretty rough ride, but it isn't a Caddy.  Like I said it has great acceleration, but not good highway passing speeds.  The gas milage is horrible, at best.  I get 13-15, 16 for about a week after I change the oil.  People that should buy this vehicle are fans of Jeep, first time Jeepers (myself), anyone who wants a pickup truck, but can't afford new ones.  And people who will take good care, slash have pride in their vehicles.  People who shouldn't buy this vehicle  are any people that don't like pickup trucks, dislike Jeep, need a nice smooth ride, and people who aren't willing to take time to admire, take pride in their vehicles.   <br><br>
