            I am the original owner of a 1993 Chevy S-10 Blazer with the Tahoe LT package (the works).  I have 105,000 miles on this truck and I love it more each day.  

One of the best things about this vehicle is the 4.3L Vortec V6 engine.  It is still the biggest V6 in its class, and it blows the others away.  It has good pickup, even at higher speeds (for an SUV) and runs very smoothly up to about 85 or 90 mph.  I have never had even the slightest problem with the engine, and I drive it hard in all sorts of conditions.  It has no problem keeping speed when crossing the Sierras or the Rockies on I-80, even with a UHaul trailer in tow.  The shift-on-the-fly 4WD is great, it has never failed to shift in or out of 4WD with ease, and I have found the Blazer to be a good vehicle in snow and off-road.  I have used it for camping and field work for years and never had a problem or come close to getting stuck.

The Blazer is responsive and the ride is pretty smooth and comfortable.  It is easy to drive and feels like something in between a truck and a car.  The turning radius is really great for an SUV of its size, far better than the Toyota 4Runner for instance.

I really prefer the old, squared, body style to the new rounded look.  The old S-10's have a lot more interior capacity.  I am almost 5'9&quot; and can lie down easily in the back with the back seat laid down (it lays down very flat).  Two people and a dog can fit to sleep in the back.  This is not true of the new Blazers.  I am always impressed with how much stuff I can fit in my Blazer.  I have moved several times and managed to fit all my belongings as well as a passenger and my dog into (and onto) the truck.

I have taken my Blazer on countless road trips, including one from San Francisco to Anchorage, and it is very comfortable.  This, I am sure, is due in part to the seats that come with the Tahoe LT package.  They are great bucket seats with electronic adjustments including lumbar support.  The front seats are spacious, but taller people may find that the driver's seat does not go back far enough for them.  The back seat is very roomy as well and can easily seat 3 adults.  The factory CD player that came with the truck was great and NEVER skipped, even on rough dirt roads.  It finally died after 6 years of trouble-free use.

I love my Blazer, but no vehicle is perfect.  I have very few complaints, but there is some room for improvement.  While the gas pedal is very responsive, the brake pedal is not.  You have to push harder in the Blazer than in most vehicles, and this can take some getting used to.  The brakes feel a little &quot;mushy.&quot;  This can be unsettling, but I have never been unable to stop in time in an emergency.  I donï¿½t think the braking system is the best, but my main complaint is with the feel of the brakes and the stiffness of the brake pedal.  Good tires are a must with this truck.  I slid all over the place before I got some Wrangler ATS tires.  The clearance leaves a little to be desired and is definitely on the low end for SUVs.  The size of the wheel wells won't allow you to put larger tires on the truck without a lift either.  My spare tire is attached to the back of the truck, and it rattles and squeaks, and has for years.  This is a common problem with the older Blazers, but the new Blazer has got the spare mounted underneath.  Other than these problems, I have only had the standard amount of smaller issues.  I did have the transmission recalled and replaced at 26,000 miles, so I can only vouch for it for 80,000 miles, but no problems so far.

My S-10 Blazer has never stranded me or let me down, and has been a great vehicle.  I love it!
