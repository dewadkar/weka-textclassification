              1962 Buick Electra 225, 18+ feet long, over 6 feet wide, weighs about as much as my dad's cargo van-over 2 tons.  Nailhead V8 (401 cubic inches) and a two-speed Dynaflow transmission.  Mine has dual exhaust with glasspacks, so it's louder than a tractor trailer going uphill.  And you know what?  It's beautiful, every last inch of it.  
  Why I bought it: I've always like American cars from the 1960's, but I prefer Dodge and Plymouth.  Something about this Buick, it's style, just called out to me though.  
  Loves/hates: I love the basic lines of the car, the overall appearance, the size, the fact that I can look in the engine bay and see an engine, not a massive clump of black spaghetti with some weird boxes mixed in.  I can work on this car myself, and I'm not a mechanic!  I don't like the fact that mine is in the process of seriously needed restoration, the previous owner made some really weird and incomplete modifications, and it's got too much rust from Midwestern roads.  I wish it had a more modern transmission so I could get more use out of the engine.  I hate the fact that I have neither the time nor the money to give this car the attention it deserves.  Note that the original equipment left on the car still works fine, including the major drivetrain components, the power steering, power windows, etc.  Unfortunately my car has been through some rough repairs in the past before I got it, and that's where I've had problems.  
  What is like to drive this vehicle:  very different, surprisingly easy, lots of fun.  If you've ever driven a motorboat it's very similar, because of the transmission.  You slide it into Drive and go, there's no shifting involved.  It's not like a modern automatic that shifts for you, in this car there is simply NO shifting!  The engine is a brute and produces enough power that shifting really isn't necessary for normal driving. I've never needed to use Low gear; maybe if I was hauling a truck or toppling a house...I drove this car about 800 miles from Indiana to Virginia this summer, and it was great!  Very comfortable seats, smooth ride, easy power steering, plenty of power for passing, no overheating.  The only real problem is gas mileage, which is terrible.  The number of nice people I meet on the road more than makes up for it, whether it's an older guy who remembers having a similar car when they were new or a youngster who just thinks it's cool.  It's kind of like walking a really cute puppy, everybody wants to come say Hi!  
  Who should buy a car like this?  Anybody with the space, time, and interest to maintain it.  I can't drive mine every day, but every day I drive it is a good day.  I wouldn't recommend it for commuting, but if you ever need a break from the millions of econobox clones out there, this is a great way to go!
  A quick note on availability: I've actually seen several '62 Electras for sale on the Internet and in Hemmings Motor News, ranging in price from about $1000 to well over $10,000, depending on condition.  Parts are available from several aftermarket sources, but since this car is fairly uncommon the parts are expensive compared to most.  Restoring a '62 Chevy Impala would probably be a lot easier and less expensive.  But if you're still reading and considering this type of project at all, ease and expense aren't your primary motivations now are they?<br><br>
