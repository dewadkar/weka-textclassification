            This is a very good car for a couples, a single person, or a family that doesn't go out together often.  The leg room in the back is enough, but it is not ample by any means.  If you haul adults or even kids around in the back seats on a regular basis, you should get a bigger car.  
The room in the hatch is sizable.  I have a speaker box with two twelve inch speakers in it almost all the time.  Even with the box in, I still have enough room for groceries or what not.  Whenever I need more room I just take out my box and fold down the back seats.  With this set-up, I can fit my drum set or camping supplies in with ease.
This car has a 2.2 flat four cylinder boxer engine in it.  Subaru says this gives their cars a lower center of gravity.  This along with the all wheel drive makes for nice handling in adverse conditions or regular driving.
Finding parts for this car can be a hassle at times, I have had to replace two things so far and have had trouble doing both (air filter and brakes).
There are two cup holders in this car.  One is in the console in between the driver and passenger seat.  The other is in the dash.  This cup holder pulls out and blocks your HVAC controls and condensation drips down onto the stereo.  I have not looked at any newer Subarus, but I hope they no longer have these cup holders.
The wheel covers that came with the car fell off a long time ago for no reason at all, I have heard that Subaru has had a problem with this and would have replaced them for me, but I didn't bother.
