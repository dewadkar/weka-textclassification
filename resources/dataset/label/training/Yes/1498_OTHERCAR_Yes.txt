                        After an extensive search, including price, comfort, and reliability, our family chose to buy a Saturn SL1 as a new car in 1996.  We opted for manual transmission, and all the saftey features. Our Saturn over the years has been a truly reliable car, we liked it so much we bought another new Saturn the following year! Our 1996 Saturn has far surpassed the reliability of any of our other cars. It is a low-maintenance car intended for the person who knows nothing about cars. 
           I inherited the car from my parents last year, as my first car. It survived not only the high-school parking lot (with not even a dent...even after another car ran into my passenger side door! Thank goodness for dent-proof doors), my Saturn hauled the Rugby team, and took me my necessary 150 miles a week on the road! It is reliable, low-maintenance, reasonably comfortable, has easy trunk access, good gass mileage, and fits into all budgets. The dent proof doors and dirt-resistant shine make this the best choice of economy sedans out on the market. The Anti locking breaks are a must have feature that have saved my life a few times during grid-lock traffic and close calls. 
            The only things I don't enjoy about my Saturn is it's cheap feeling interior, and the Air Conditioning system. The fabric screams &quot;economy buy&quot; and is a bit scratchy at times. The Air-Conditioning in my Saturn is usually ineffective, besides blowing air, it doesn't seem to do much of anything. We have had the same problem on our 1997 Saturn as well.  As long as you don't mind a cheap feeling interior, and somewhat ineffective AC, I would recommend that everyone thinking of buying a Saturn.<br><br>
