            We acquired our E150 Glaval Conversion after we outgrew our Windstar in 1998, which vehicle we enjoyed without reservation over two consecutive leases.  Unfortunately, other than the size upgrade, I can't generate much enthusiasm for the Econoline, even with the conversion extras onboard.

Admittedly, some of the things that I dislike about the vehicle might be alleviated by selecting different options (so I'll leave those complaints out), but I think that overall the vehicle's quality is average at best.

The 15&quot; wheels--the only size available according to my dealer who, by the way, like most Ford dealers seems to have only a marginal level of interest in selling me the vehicle that I want as opposed to the one that he wants to get off of his lot--are inadequate for the weight/handling tasks required of them in support of such a large vehicle.  The interior finishing materials are rather rapid-wearing (now at 2 years and 44K miles), including a broken cupholder, less-than durable carpeting and upholstery, and a balky stereo system that has been in for service no less than 4 times. 

Weld cracks are visible on several door edges and the fiberglass passenger running board cracked before the 20K mile marker without usage that could be called excessive.  The high-capacity air system struggles and often fails to keep up with the demands placed on it--even with Michigan's short 4 month summers.  The driver's seat--the only one I have really spent any time in--absolutely makes you want to kill yourself for any number of reasons, including weak and uncomfortably placed armrests and the tight fit with respect to the proximity of the engine cover.  We have not abused the vehicle--my kids/wife will confirm that I am an absolute Hitler when it comes to eating/drinking/other activity inside the van--yet it looks and has worn like, well....hell.

The phony luggage rack on the roof is also a bit of a puzzle as the manual readily admits it to be decorative only. WTF?! And for the $30K plus price I think that something as basic as automatic door lock engagement when traversing through reverse should be standard--it is on just about everything else nowadays.

What do I like?  I suppose the engine is decent--a Triton 4.6L V8 with plenty of power for passing and merging on the freeway. It is is prepped for TV/audio but we don't use those features so I remain unimpressed.  Let 'em read books or look out the window like we used to do in the old days, I always say!

In general, the only redeeming qualities of this vehicle, in my book, are its size and the engine's--thus far--mechanical reliability. 

I dislike the thing enough that we just put it up for sale, and we are only asking the buyout price just to be able to ditch the thing and get something more enjoyable.  What are we getting?  Well, I don't know yet, but you can count on the fact that this time it will be what I want, not what the dealer wants to unload...<br><br>
