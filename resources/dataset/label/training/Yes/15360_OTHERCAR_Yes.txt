            As a Valued Sony Employee (hehehe) I have the great opportunity of being able to be paid overtime to take products home with me for training.  Yeah, right, I am getting paid to play with toys...is this a great business or what?

Anyways, last week I took home the MVCFD83 camera.  First of all, there is the appeal of having a camera that uses floppy diskettes, which is great because everyone has piles of floppy diskettes lying around that they don't know what to do with anymore, and you can fit about 12 pictures on one diskette at a decent resolution!

Another appeal to the Mavica Camera is that you can take 15 second MPEG1 videos on a Floppy Diskette, put it in your computer, and email Grandma a video of the new baby walking or whatever (I personally sent one of me riding my motorcycle down the street at 120 MPH on 1 wheel...I expect to hear any day that Grandma had a heart attack!)...but whatever you use it for, it definitely adds to your level of coolness within the family.

The pictures really come out good, and there are built in effects for the pictures if you decide you want to use those rather than edit them on your computer (works great of you have the Sony photo printer that you just plug your Floppy Disk into and it prints directly from the Diskette and you on't need a computer).

The only negative thing I could find about the camera was about a 2-3 second delay from the time you press the button until the time the picture is actually snapped.  This makes those &quot;Take a picture of your really hot cousin in the shower before she can kick you out&quot; pictures rather difficult!  But if you aren't going to use the camera for those extremely dangerous action shots, then you should have no problems.<br><br>
