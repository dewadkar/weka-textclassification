            Well, I went and did it, after swearing that I would never own a &quot;mini-ute&quot; I went out and bought a new 2000 Honda CR-V for my wife.  For those of you familiar with my opinions, I have raved about the Jeep Cherokee in the past, and still am sold on its benefits and capabilities, but as a city-car, it doesn't even compare the CR-V.

Of the things that the CR-V does well, one you would never expect from a Honda.  It has a HUGE interior for its exterior dimensions, it has easily twice the rear legroom of a 4-door Cherokee for the back-seat passengers, and it also has comparable rear-cargo space due to the exterior-mounted spare.  It has a host of little niceties that are par for the course in a Honda--cup holders, storage spaces, a built-in picnic table and an insulated compartment below the cargo floor.

Before I go too far off on the things that I like about this vehicle, I'll start with the disappointments.  First, it needs more power.  Honda has compensated for the 4-bangers lack of oomph by gearing the front and rear differentials for decent acceleration, and while they succeeded they did sacrifice a bit of fuel economy and a lot of highway noise for it.  They need to increase the displacement of the motor, perhaps a torque-optimized Accord 2.3L and then raise the gearing for quieter cruising and similar acceleration.  From a styling standpoint it is typical Honda, attractive, but not flashy in any way.  The driving position feels to me a bit odd/high for a Honda, but my three previous Hondas/Acuras have all been sporty coupes... so it is most likely just me.  The interior is well-executed, but I think that they should go back to green instrument-lights and kill the Cincinnati Bengals orange.  I also wish the shifter was in a nice center console, but alas, the minivan theme has crept up here, with a flat floor and a fold-down cup-holder tray that I find a bit tacky and the gear-selector mounted on the column where it should NEVER be unless its in a truck.

The things that I like about the CR-V are its typical Honda-handling, never stellar for grip, but very communicative for a vehicle of its type and also very pleasant to drive toward the limit.  Off-roading should be curtailed to gravel roads and open-fields, or minor trails.  While it does possess the suspension-travel to accomplish more, the engine and trans would likely not oblige and the light-weight body structure would also likely suffer from repeated abuse.  The CR-V also scores big in the &quot;owner appeal&quot; segment due to its good maintenance-history and the H on the grille.  The CR-V is also keeping its value VERY well, loosing from 20-40% over 3.5 years depending on milage.  I will also admit that I like the options afforded me by owning a vehicle of this genre, camping is easy and fun, tailgating is vastly improved and so is long-distance travel and hauling bodies (live or dead! LOL).

When compared to its peers, the CR-V can easily be distinguished as a superior machine.  The Kia Sportage, Isuzu Amigo, and Geo Tracker are simply not in the same league of refinement, comfort, or reliability, the Suzuki Grand Vitara falls into this category as well.  The Toyota RAV 4 is its only true competitor, but my past experience with used RAV 4s (while working at a dealership) and a recent evaluation of a new model, left me with a poor taste in my mouth due to lack-luster acceleration (addressed with 20 more HP in 2001), a VERY noisy interior and a very cheap-feeling finish inside and out.  The driving characteristics of the Toyota were also less refined/enjoyable.  Overall a solid vehicle plagued by being the first to market and letting the Honda know its competition.  The other vehicles that could be compared are the Cherokee 4-door, the Chevy Blazer, and the Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute.  The former pair are much more &quot;American&quot; with a less-forgiving ride and much larger engines, allowing for far more off-road ability, they also exhibit the typical American flaw of mediocre fuel economy at best.  The new Ford-Mazda twins may be the greatest threat to the CR-V with V-6 power and similar styling and sizing.  The jury is still out on the new vehicles, but i suspect they will offer the best competition, although we are still awaiting the new RAV 4 as well.  Perhaps the greatest distinguishment between the CR-V and its peers is that it is very quiet over rough surfaces, far less than any other sport-ute I've ever driven costing less than $35,000.

In the end I expect a good 6-7 years and 100,000 miles of service from this vehicle with few or no unscheduled repairs, and I do believe that it is less of a compromise and more a &quot;more of the right-stuff and less of the wrong-stuff&quot; vehicle than other reviewers have penned it to be.  I do wish it had more power with possibly a V-6 option, but that would mean increasing the weight by beefing up the other mechanicals.<br><br>
