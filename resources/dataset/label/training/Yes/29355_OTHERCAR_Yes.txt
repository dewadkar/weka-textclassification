            I researched my CRV for several months before purchasing it last week.  I got the 1998 EX in Silver.  I am very please so far, especially with how much room is actually inside.  It is very easy to park.  I live in a metropolitan area where the parking lots downtown barely fit larger vehicles.  I have no problem parking or wheelin' around! 

One thing that I am adjusting to is the visibility when backing up.  I have found that it is hard to see behind me. This is something to consider, especially if you're short like me (make sure to try this during the test drive).  Also, the brakes are not as touchy as I like.  It takes a while for me to get stopped.  This is something else I have been adjusting to.  I would suggest a &quot;mini-brake test&quot; when test driving.  

The interior is wonderful and again, I love all of the head-room and leg-room!  The CD Player rocks.... the speakers are great!  My favorite thing about my CRV is that I know it's going to hold it's value and I know I will own it for a long, long time!!  I will definitely recommend this vehicle to my friends who are shopping. 

Oh yeah, the gas mileage is pretty good too (about 25 MPG).<br><br>
