            I bought my first SUV about a year ago.  I got a used 1995 green Tracker.  I absolutely love everything about this vehicle.  It is only a four cylinder, but I never feel like I don't have enough power.  I can take off from a stop and not worry about anyone hitting me from behind.  I am honestly a poor driver and this vehicle is perfect for me.  I can pull it into any parking spot, not only because it's small, but it has a small wheel base which means it can turn on a dime - literally!  I enjoy having a convertible vehicle in the summer time and really enjoy having a strong heater in the winter time.  I live in Maine, so it gets pretty cold up here and I am NEVER cold in that vehicle!  We bought an electric start set up so I can warm it up from the house and let me tell you - that thing gets HOT HOT HOT!!!  The only draw back I have experienced with this vehicle that the driver's side door was not supported well from the inside.  We did have to have some repair work done to it, but I still absolutely love it!!!<br><br>
