            I needed a high quality camera that was easy to use.  Although it is a little pricy, I couldn't be happier with the FD91.
I'm a manufacturer of textiles, and I purchased the camera to archive all of my designs.  It's a tedious task, but the floppy disk feature makes it so much easier... especially when I want to e-mail a quick picture to a potential customer.  
One thing to keep in mind is the battery life.  The box says it will last 1 to 2 hours.  I find that it generally lasts about 1.
The camera is also a little bulky, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who wants a camera to take on vacation.  It's more suited for someone who doesn't need to carry the camera around too much.
Overall, I think the camera is great because it suits my needs.  If you can afford it and you don't mind the bulkiness, check it out.  It's worth the money.  <br><br>
