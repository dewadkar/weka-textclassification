            This is actually my husband's truck but I do drive it every once in a while.  We bought the truck because you just don't live in Texas and not have a truck.  You never know when you will need to haul something.  We went ahead and got the extended cab because we already had one child and one on the way.  Although it's not a choice for long vacations with the children, it's nice to have the option to take all the kids if you want to.

Here's what I hate about this truck.  I really don't know how to say it except that it is a big pain to park this truck.  I have embarrassed myself more than once by having to back up, go forward only to have to repeat it again and again. Some of it may have to do with the operator of the vehicle but not all of it.  I've even seen my husband have to try it again because it's just doesn't turn tight.

It also has a pretty bumpy ride but it is a pick-up after all.  

I do like the comforts and the roominess of the truck.  We can put all three kids in the back of the cab and go load up the new furniture.  It's a family event.<br><br>
