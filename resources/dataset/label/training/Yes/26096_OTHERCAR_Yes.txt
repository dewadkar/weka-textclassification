            The Epson PhotoPC 750Z takes some really sharp pictures for its rated 1.25 mega pixel resolution. It's also easy to use from the gate, but has some advanced features that will take some time to learn.  Like all these cameras, it has multi-function little buttons that you need to become familiar with to remember what they do.  It has a large LCD viewer for  composing or viewing your pictures.  It comes with a decent software bundle for downloading your photos to your computer, editing and managing them, and for uploading images to the camera. A negative for  this camera is the price.  It retails for $599.99, but I found a place advertising it online for $438.00 (this price was so low compared to other online locations, I suspect it might be a &quot;gray market&quot; version).

It comes with a camera bag, cables for PC (it plugs into a serial port, and doesn't have a USB plug, a minus for speedy transfers) and MAC ( direct print communications),  a video cable,  an 8 Mb Lexar media card (it has 4 Mb internal memory, for a total of 12 Mb, adequate, but nothing to write home about), four rechargeable NiMh batteries with a charger (it uses all four), a wrist strap, a lens cover (it falls off and does not automatically retract when the camera is turned on), and a CD with the software.  The CD tells you how to make floppies (requires 19 of them), but you'd have to do that on someone else's computer if you don't have a CD.  The camera has a flash that can be set to go off on every photo, never, or automatically.  It also has  3X optical zoom that is quite sharp.   There are two manuals, one is a very thin idiot book entitled &quot;Getting Started&quot;. I was able to use the camera immediately after browsing this book (no fancy stuff, but you can take good pictures).  Then there's the &quot;War and Peace&quot; sized manual explaining all the advanced features and how the software works.  Initially charging the supplied batteries is no small task because it requires charging them three times.  Two times at 2.5 hours per, and a last one for 20 minutes.  After that initial marathon, they recharge like other batteries, just once.  

I needed it the morning after I got it, so I was up very late with the charging protocol, but it was so easy to use I got a lot of good shots, and I'd never used any digital camera before.  The zoom control is a thumb operated button ergonomically located on the back of the camera, which makes it very natural to use. All the controls are properly placed, the LCD screen is 2&quot; square for good viewing, and the camera optics are excellent.  What I didn't like about the camera, but which are endemic in all digital cameras, are multi-function buttons.  I forgot how to view pictures, which only requires using two multi-function buttons, and had to retrieve the &quot;Idiot manual&quot; to do it.  You also have to either have good eyes, or keep your reading glasses handy to make out some of the LCD readouts.  

The camera is capable of producing standard color photos (640 X 480 pixels; 178 pictures with the 12 Mb of memory supplied), fine with moderate compression (1280 X 960 pixels; 54 pictures with supplied memory),  super fine with low compression (1280 X 960; 26 pictures), and Epson's proprietary HyPict using low compression (1600 X 1200[interpolated]; 16 pictures).  In black and white it can take 54 pictures at 1280 X 960 pixels with moderate compression, 26 pictures with low compression, and 16 pictures with monochrome HyPict.  Epson recommends the HyPict setting if you intend to make 8 X 10 copies.  I found out quickly that you should buy a bigger memory card for it, 32-48 Mb would be good for most people. You can always regain memory by deleting the ones that didn't turn out.  The camera will use the memory card for storing pictures first, so to use the 4 Mb of internal memory, you need to remove the card when it's full.  It has a timer with a 10 second delay, and a macro lens function.  

The software bundle is more than adequate, but if you intend to work on your photos in any detail, you'll need a good image editor.  The photo manager software is fairly intuitive, displays thumbnails, and creates a storage folder in &quot;Mydocuments&quot; (makes it easy to find as opposed to apps that put those folders in the program directory somewhere).  The serial connection for downloading is slow, so if I had it to do again, I'd get one that had a USB connection.  What makes this camera a good buy, is that it is Epson,  that even I could use it to take pictures right away with only minimal reading of the idiot book, and that it is ergonomically quite comfortable.  What do I wish for; closer to two mega-pixels at this price,  a USB connection, and built-in magnifying glass over the LCD function screens.
