            Yes, I did purchase a 2000 Elantra sedan.  I took the sedan and wagon on a test drive and found that the wagon had a lot of road noise that echoed through it.  The sedan was much quieter and handled very good for a car in it's class.  If you can deal with the road noise the wagon is a good buy.  I would encourage you to think about having the wagon undercoated or having some extra sound deadener (insulation) installed because it can get annoying unless you like to ride with the radio turned up.

As for the sedan, it's peppy.  That little 2.0 is a nice suprize even connected to the automatic.  Yes, it is comfortable crusing the highway at 65+ and with the overdrive the engine is not overworked and still has enough power for passing.  

It comes with power windows, power locks, air conditioning, power steering, power brakes and the driver seat has the lumbar support too.  It also has a list of standards that you will pay for in other vehicles.

One thing to keep in mind is the 10/100,000mi warranty.  It is important to note that Hyundai states this is for the original owner only ( I have seen somewhere on the Hyundai web site that it can be transferred to immediate family only )  So if you are buying it used you may miss out on the big factory warranty.  Even though the second owner warranty is not bad either.

It seems that there is a way around this warranty problem for the owner.  The dealer has an optional extended warranty available which covers more than just the powertrain and is transferrable.  It goes to 10yr/100,000mi and of course there is an extra charge for this.  The dealer the I purchased it from was retailing that extended warranty for $1,000.00  Which was still not a bad deal considering what it covered and the cost and likelyhood of repairs over the next 10yrs or 100k mi.  

I have spent a few years working on automobiles myself as an ASE certified master technician and have taken many vehicles out on test drives and for the amount you spend on this for a new car you can't beat it.  Realize at some time every vehicle needs some sort of work done on it and you will realzie the value of the warranty.  

Will it hold up well and for a long time?  That remains to be seen but that's what the warranty's for.  It's not a BMW but then it's more than just cheap transportation.  

So far I am very happy with it, this sure isn't an Excel.  Would I recommend it to a friend, sure would and have.  (the amount paid includes tax, tags and the extended warranty, the bottom line was I got a great deal on the car anyway)<br><br>
