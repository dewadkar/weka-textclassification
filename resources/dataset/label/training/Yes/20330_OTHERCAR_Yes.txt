            I bought this vehicle because I received advice from many of my friends, that Nissan makes good cars.  So in January 1997, I purchased a used Nissan with 7,000 miles for $17,600.  I love my vehicle for its color (champagne), and body style.  It is very spacious but sporty.  I have power windows, doors, locks, side view mirrors, anti-lock brakes and dual airbags, which I highly recommend.  The Altima rides rather smooth and has good engine power. 
 
I had only one downfall since I've own this vehicle.  Two years ago my grandmother passed away, and I had to drive to Georgia, which is over 500 miles from Boynton Beach, Florida.  Returning home a week later the car began to run hot and the engine light came on.  Now keep in mind, I took very good care of this car from having it detailed to get the oil changed.

I decided that I would get off the next exit in Gainesville, but the car began to choke and the engine completely shut off.  I didn't have enough money to have it towed, so my father bought a chain and pulled it the 300 miles home.  Upon arriving home, I immediately phoned Wallace Nissan and they towed the car.  They were not very cooperative.  They said my engine was fried and it would cost $3000 for a new one.  

I tried really hard to get the company to pay this new engine, but I failed.  I explained to them that I didn't any warning signs that something was wrong with the engine until it was too late.  But they still declined fixing it.  I ended up having to call around looking for an engine, I found one for $1500.  My fathers friend has a shop, so he put it in for the cost of parts only.  Greg had the car up and running, when he discovered that the car would not go in reverse.  Unfortunately, my father towing my car 300 miles was a bad idea because it burned out my transmission.  To get a new transmission, I paid over $2000.  I hadn't had any problems since, but I figure $4000 could have been paid to my bank towards my car payments.  

In spite of my trials, I still would recommend this vehicle to others.  <br><br>
