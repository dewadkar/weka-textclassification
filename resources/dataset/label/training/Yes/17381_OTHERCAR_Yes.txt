            Its unfair to put all of the 96-99 Eclipses in the same category, they 6 different trim levels are all distinctly different cars.  I bought a 99 Spyder GS new in 1998 and know all of its quirks inside and out.
The Spyder GS comes with a 2.4l four cylinder with a modest 150 or so horses and lots of low end torque.  Its most common configuration give you sport cloth seats, AM/FM Cassette premium sound, 16" alloy wheels, and Power windows/top/locks.  Theoretically it comes in a lower trim level with a base stereo and 14" steel wheels, but none of this configuration were ever produced. The GS Spyder should not be confused with the GS-T Spyder as it has a completely different engine, trim level, and handling characteristics.

This car is absolutely beautiful, its one of those timeless designs that will not begin to look old until the car is well past is prime.  For that reason its a good investment, it won't get the tired old car look for years to come.  It does turn heads and you WILL get looks.

The high point of the car are as follows:
The powertrain is nearly bulletproof with the 5-sp manual.  The engine is a SOHC slightly bigger version of the turbo found in the GS-T.  It has a raspy feel with plenty of power for around town driving.  The car is quiet and solid feeling for a convertible, the Spyder was built from the ground up as a convertible and is not merely a Eclipse coupe with is roof cut off.  This is very important when choosing a convertible, many are just chopped versions of there hardtop cousins, this leads to numerous shakes, rattles and a all around loose, loud ride.  The soft top is well assembled and can be converted in less than 30 seconds with the touch of 1 button.  The top is equipped with a glass rear window, again very important.  I'm sure you've seen convertibles with the rotted out plastic rear window that is barely translucent. The Premium sound system is a 210-watt, infinity unit - better than most aftermarket models.

Its flaws are relatively few.  Because of its stunning looks many people with mistake it for its true sport car cousin the Spyder GS-T.  The GS is not as much of a sports car as it is a cruiser.  Its fast but you're not gonna win any races and the handling is soft.  This car may have 4 seats but dont be mistaken, it IS a two seater.  The trunk is small enough to hold one suitcase.  It was relatively expensive at 24 grand for a car with few amenities, but you pay the premium for the convertible top.

The car has had no major problems, my dealers service department has been taken care of minor issues with no problems at all.
