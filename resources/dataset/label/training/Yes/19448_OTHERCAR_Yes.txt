            It's the only car I wanted since 16. Now I'm happy to say, 15 years later I go it. My Mazda 626 is everything I've wanted in a car. The new color ( Vancouver Blue ) raises a lot of eyebrows. I am constantly asked about it. It performs well and purrs like a kitten. Mine is fully loaded so I am really enjoying the luxury at an affordable price. $26,000. The cd system is nice, and if you can negotiate it, ask for the cassette player to match. My leather seats fits in nicely with the style and elegance that I had in mind. In fact, I'm the only one in town with this particular car . I'm asked by at least 2-3 people about it everyday.
About a month ago I almost go into an accident but the anti-lock breaks was a gem. I brought my baby back in line and I avoided a three car pile up.
I recommend it for the up and coming business woman/man that may still be on a budget, but who want to dress ( and drive) to impress. I have a five year contract, but i know I'll be trading it in for a new one in five years, I'm a Mazda girl all the way.<br><br>
