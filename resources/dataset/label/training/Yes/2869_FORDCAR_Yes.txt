            This is my second '93 Escort wagon. Back when I test-drove the first one, I noted an annoying lack of feel in the steering. The car also had no clue where "center" was. But I blew it off and bought it anyway (left over in late '93) because one of Mom's friends had the steering column shear in his Dodge Shadow, which was the only other new car I could afford, and I drove more slowly than the rest of the traffic whenever it rained or sleeted.

I was driving to a Christmas party one night in the rain with my eldest son sitting shotgun when a Firebird swerved around me to get into a turn lane to my left (what a jerk), but he didn't get out of the way entirely (what a totally irresponsible jerk). When I swerved to avoid clipping him, the steering, by nature almost totally clueless, expressed its complete confusion by letting go of the pavement and refusing to respond to any input. We launched off the curb to the right and the car rolled several times.

We came out of it without a scratch. After I walked around the car, I saw the body had absorbed all the energy of the repeated impacts by deforming in a really ugly way. Plus one for Ford. But the front end shouldn't have let loose in the first place. Minus one. The car was totalled (not because of the wreck, but because the barbecued chicken and the two cheesecakes we were transporting to the party got into every part of the upholstery, carpet, and headliner).

That first car was a great value overall (call me sentimental but I also liked the Wayne Stamping Plant/UAW flag sticker on the windshield), so I bought '93 Escort wagon #2 with the insurance money (left over in early '94). It's up to 137,000 miles now (added: 164,000 as of May 2001). I change oil every 10,000 miles as recommended by the manual, a lengthy interval that may keep the car from seeing 1/4 million miles, but that's the current goal.

The car is on its fourth set of front brake pads. The brake tech I go to told me that Ford really dropped the ball on the design of the calipers, and his dad's Escort had the same problem. The rotors have been turned once and there's enough meat gone that I'll have to get another set with the fifth set of pads. Also, it's eaten up more front tires than it should have (I think the vagueness of the front end has something to do with this). But I had a tip to just let the front end eat tires; it's cheaper than getting alignments, which never seem to hold very well anyway. I had a tip to start getting my brakes at Midas. They're not as good as the brakes I've been buying, but they have a lifetime warranty, so it's the best deal for this car. You just keep going back for more.

Routine or minor stuff: I replaced the timing belt at 100,000 miles and bought a new clutch at the same time. Another clutch was called for at 152,000. The battery blew up one summer day. The battery terminal clamps stretched to uselessness, so I replaced them. The fabric on the back of the sun visors turned to dust a while back, and the velcro gave up so the mirror lids have to be rubber-banded in place. The roll-up rear compartment cover gave up the ghost early. The lighter socket died. Two sets of low beams blew out in lightning storms. The speakers blew. The air conditioning is too weak (and this was the year before the switch from freon; hate to think what the '94 is like). I think they made it that way because the engine's weak. I'm glad I bought the manual; I'd hate to see how slow the automatic goes. Surprise: the original lifts still hold the rear gate open.

There's a 125,000-mile Escort reviewed here (read that one, too). I'm not a used car buyer, but I'm reviewing this in the used car section because my experiences lead me to believe this would make a good buy as a used car. An old rule of thumb says you ought to budget 20% of a used car's purchase price for repairs no matter how clean a bill of health your check-out mechanic gives it. If your check-out mechanic gives a used last-generation Escort the nod, I think you could safely budget a good bit less for near-term maintenance.

Gotta run now! When I hit the road, I like to take the family with me. Every three-day weekend we get off, we go up to Mom's, about 425 miles. This week I'm playing in Florida, about 950 miles south of here, so that's where we're driving today (taking three leisurely days to do it). I've got my AAA card and my pocket phone, but I don't think I'll be needing either (except to get lodging discounts). This car hasn't left me stranded yet.

<b>Bad news (Jul 01):</b> at 165,000 the AC died the Final Death ($1,000 worth, according to the local Firestone; could do it myself for $500 in parts). <b>More bad news (Dec 01):</b> at 172,000 the wiper switch inside the all-in-one steering column switch assembly went south. New switch: an astounding $330. Had hoped to run this hoss to a quarter million miles, but it may not be worth it. Thinking hard. <b>The end and a new beginning (Jan 02):</b> Doing my own work, my parts list (A/C, wiper switch, and windshield--the crack had just spread into the driver's side) just went over $1,000 with no guarantee another week of driving wouldn't see further additions to the list. At 172,356 miles, I called it quits and got $200 trade-in for it on a new 2002 Hyundai Accent (would've liked another Escort S/W but they're discontinued; couldn't afford a new Focus). Boo on the Accent (you can read my review if you want). Had it for all of 36 hours and swapped up to a leftover 2001 Elantra sedan (I'll review it after I've driven it a while).
