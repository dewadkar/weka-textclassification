            This car is great.  Its the first one i have had, and i love it.  It handles well, is quick with a V6, and just all around nice.  The price is very good, and the car needs little matinance.  Mine is green with tan leather.  I love the sun roof, and how you are able to swith the car from sport, winter, to econ mode when needed.  Lots of room inside with a built in child seat.  The two front seats have heater seats in them to warm you up on cold days.  This is a great car, and i reccommend it to anyone for a first car, or a new car.<br><br>
