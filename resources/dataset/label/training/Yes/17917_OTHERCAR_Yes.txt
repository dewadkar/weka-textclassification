            I bought my '94 SVX LSi in February of '95 with 15K miles on the clock. It had been a demonstrator. The moment I drove it I knew it was the car for me. I now have 55K miles and have enjoyed 5 South Dakota winters and have never gotten stuck, nor has it ever stranded me with a breakdown. The heating/AC system is excellent, quickly warming up in the winter and cooling down in our hot summers. Yes, parts can be expensive but given the anticipated life span of my ownership things really work out to be about the same in my case.
This car rides like its on rails and exudes confidence because, I guess, of its weight, almost 4000 lbs.
Slightly over 14,000 were built. If your looking for an unusual car with excellent mechanicals, all-weather capability, knock out looks and a high degree of exclusiveness (you won't see yourself at every traffic light) try to find one that was taken care of.
I have not had any of the trouble (knock wood) reported on earlier cars transmissions or wheel bearings, but I'm not a hot rodder either, I got that out of my system already.
Great car, solid, reliable, functional and breathtaking to look at.
In the past 5+ years I have not seen another car I'd buy.
I see I should be writing about a '97 and mines a '94 but there is no real difference in the two. From '94 on any SVX LSi is pretty much alike. <br><br>
