            I purchased the 3000GT VR-4 when I graduated from college because it had been my dream vehicle since the car's introduction.  I suffered sticker shock initially, but through the years I have really appreciated the value I got for the money.

My car has 60,000 miles on it and other than routine maintenance, I have only had to repair the antenna mast ($80) and the acceleration sensor ($400).  Routine maintenance cost $20 for oil changes, $250 for the 30,000 mile service, and $600 for the 60,000 mile service--not bad, considering all the work was done at the dealership.  The original Z-rated tires stayed on my car until recently and cost $600 to change.  They were still in good shape and fine for normal driving, but 6-year-old tires made me nervous.  In contrast, my friends who own BMWs (an excellent car) get raped every time they see the dealer.  They're afraid to take the car anywhere else because it might void the warranty.

When I first bought my car, most insurers laughed at me and would not insure a $40,000 twin-turbo car for a 22-year-old.  I paid $3300 a year for the first year.  The rates decreased ever year, and now I pay $1000 per year.

In return for these costs, I get blistering speed comparable to some of the fastest cars on the road.  I'm normally not a speed racer, but if you've ever been stuck behind a long line of cars on a two-lane road, you'll appreciate the acceleration.  The all wheel drive handling is superb. The car has only skidded once in my six years of driving and the car quickly recovered from the skid.  Despite the car's weight (nearly 2 tons), it is nimble and brakes better than most smaller cars I have driven.  It's no Miata or RX-7, but I figure I'll appreciate the extra mass in case of a collision.  The car feels solid at high speeds.  The car is bumpy on rough roads, but you've got give up something for sports-car handling.  Overall, the car is extremely fun to drive and was made for the open road.

All the comfort and amenities you'll ever want is included VR-4.  The front seats are comfortable, but the back seats are only for emergencies.  The best thing about the back seats is that they fold down so I can transport my skis.  The Bose acoustics are excellent.  I would not recommend this car for anyone over 6 feet.  The worst thing about this car is the reverse gear.  Every valet will inevitably try to reverse the car while in 6th gear.  As far as styling, let's just say that this car attracted a lot of attention when I first bought it.  Now that there a lot of these cars on the road, especially in a car town like LA where they must hand out Porsches at the airport, the attention has died down.

I definitely recommend the VR-4 if you buy a 3000GT and care about performance because I think only the V-6 twin turbo engine can compensate for the weight.  Since I don't believe Mitsubishi sells 3000GTs in the U.S. anymore, my advice is to look for one that has been well maintained and not driven into the ground.
