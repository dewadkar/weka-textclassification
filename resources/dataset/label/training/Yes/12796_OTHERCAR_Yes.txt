            Last month I tested a few digital cameras. One of them was Canon PowerShort S20. This are my remarks about this camera.

The camera uses 1/1.8&quot; CCD matrix with resolution 3.34 megapixels 3.14 effective megapixels). Maximum picture size is 2048 x 1536 pixels. There are 4 resolution settings: from 640 x 480 pixels per inch (4&quot; x 6&quot;) to
2048 x 1536 pixels per inch (10&quot; x 12&quot;). Therefore memory requirements for each resolution are different: from 300-400 Kb (640 x 480) to from 1.5-1.8 Mb (2048 x 1536).

The camera has very compact design (105,4 � 69,4 � 33,8 mm) and weights
about 270 g (without battery). Gold color is fine.

Standart kit includes:
- the camera,
- 2CR5 Lithium battery and CR 2016 (for saving date and time),
- cables: TV-out, serial, USB,
- software: TWAIN driver, Canon PhotoStitch 3.1, Zoom Browser EX 2.2
- CompactFlash card 16 Mb type I/II,
- manuals.

It's very lightweight and compact (easily fits in pocket). Usually cameras are plastic, this is metal. In spite of resolution (2048 X 1536 max), it's not professional camera. This is a camera for the amateur with a few additional features.

The camera has a lot of features. The shutter button and the mode select wheel are placed on the top. Controls for zooming, flash controls, menu, Macro, timer and LCD (1,8� - 1140000 pixels) are placed on the back. The zoom, menus and navigation are all intuitive. The menu is viewed on viewfinder screen. It's easy to use.

Automatic mode is great. You must point and shoot, and nothing more. 1600 X 1200 with medium compression - it's enough for amateur. But in manual mode you can choose all: resolution, level of compression and other. In special mode you may use the camera for low light conditions, black/white and fast moving objects.

It has 2:1 optical zoom and 2:1 or 4:1 digital zoom. Optical zoom is very good. But I don't advice work with digital zoom. Results are mediocre.

Included software to allow you to manipulate with yours photos on computer very comfortable.

I think this camera is required the next improvements:
- add a rechargable battery
- increase optical zoom
- add IBM 340 Mb Microdrive.<br><br>
