            I've owned quite a few Benzos in the past, including a 98 C280 Sport and a 96 E320. By far, the ML is much better than any of the others. Given that I'm a big guy, over 6ft tall and 280 lbs. This vehicle provided me with the most comfort during long trips, as I didn't feel I was sitting so close to the ground. After a recent 6 hour drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles, I stepped from the car feeling fresh and without any cramps.

I purchased the vehicle used, in the mid 30 thousand range with about 15,000 miles on it. I wanted an upscale SUV yet couldn't bring myself to fork out 45 grand for a Lincoln Navigator. I've had it for over a year now and am extremely happy with it. I have a tendency to fix-up my cars, and its quite difficult to do so on this one due to the fact that very few companies make aftermarket parts for it. I was able to find some larger wheels and tires, a body kit, exhaust and intake system, and a full aftermarket stereo system.

Can't be all good right? Well given that I love this car so much, there are a few things that could be improved. It is true that this car doesn't feel much like a traditional Mercedes, as the door are lighter and the interior construction is a bit weaker. In reality, it is a SUV, actually more of a truck then a car, so I did expect a truck-like feel. Another qualm I have, is the power. Yes if I could afford a ML 430, I wouldn't be complaining, but since I've got the 320 all I can say is I get better gas mileage. I felt that Mercedes should have put a little more power into this 6 cylinder engine, 215hp is measely compared to other SUVs in this class. Living on the West Coast, I can't complain since I hardly ever go off-road nor do I ever tow. The gas prices out here is like $2.50 a gallon for the good stuff, and I can average 23-25 mpg in this car and that is almost unheard of in the SUV category.

Overall I am very happy with this car and will probably keep it much longer than I the other ones. I'd recommend this vehicle for those who want a high-end SUV, the prestige of owning a Benz, and a comfortable ride. Its perfect for trips to visit the in-laws, the mall, or just to cruise. I wouldn't recommend it for those jungle heads who want to go in the mud, over big rocks, or deep into the lake. The ML is the Grey Poupon of SUVs.<br><br>
