            First off, I am a 17 year old new driver.  I wanted a small car that is easy to drive, has good pep and good gas mileage due to my limited income.  I never thought i would even think about buying a Neon, but once i sat in this thing  I fell in love.  I am about 6' 1&quot; and need my room in the car.  This car has unbelievable leg room for such a small car, I am comfortable while driving it, and while in the passenger seat I am able to stretch my legs out completely.  Also while the seats are all the way back their is room in the back seats.  The seats themselves are one of the most comfortable I've sat in for awhile.  The engine is a 2.0 Liter 132 HP that can move pretty well.  I bought the ES model in silver fully loaded including sunroof, Aluminum wheels, 4 cd- changer in the front(stereo is great sounding), AC , Alarm , heated rear view mirrors etc.  The car has all i want comfy and doesn't have the look of the old neons.  It is definately a car to go look at, and I Highly recommend the ES model which just makes the car so much better.  All in all I've had no problems with it yet, the ride is great features are excellent and I got a great deal on it above all.  Check this car out, the Neon name hasn't been the best in the past but it has definately changed.<br><br>
