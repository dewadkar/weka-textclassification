            This is a great little car at a awesome price!  I have had my 2004 Focus ZX3 for less than two weeks now and I am totally in love.  

It started out with my husband and I shopping for a MINI Cooper which I have been drooling over for years now.  We needed dependable wheels but also like to have something sporty and unique.  After doing a lot of research and comparisons the Focus just made sense.  The fully loaded Focus was half what the MINI would have been after the loan was paid off!

The Focus is very roomy inside for the two of us and even in the back seat!  My husband and I are 6 foot tall and there are no complaints.  Lots of head and shoulder room as well.  The back seat seems to fit a couple adults easily once they get in there.  Getting in and out of the back could be difficult for larger people.

Cargo space is great I actually leave the back seat folded down most of the time so I can haul my stuff around. Great car for errands, etc.  Next to each seat is a pocket big enough to hold cd's, glasses etc.  Glove box is also pretty roomy.  Center armrest has just enough room for your garage door opener and some sunglasses.

This car has more get up and go than I expected.  145 horsepower is perfect for a small car like this.  Very zippy and no hesitation when you hit the gas. And reminding me of gas, this car gets around 30 mpg!

I bought the automatic transmission and it feels very powerfull.  You barely notice it shifting! Usually in a smaller car you give up power by getting a auto transmission but I think they really have improved technology in that area.

Brakes do the job but are not as good as the four wheel disc I am used to having on my Honda.  Would be nice if they make that a option on future models.  I have the optional ABS package on my ZX3.

I have the "Premium" package which give the car a little more of a performance edge on the suspension.  It corners well with very little sway.  Nice sticky tires came with this package but they do track a bit on the freeway which takes some getting used to.

For a new cheap car this one just feels well put togather. Yes there is plastic but it is good quality and nice finishes.  The car feels very stable and is nicely equiped. The options I got are the 6 CD changer stereo package, side airbags (in the seats), ABS brakes and then the premium package.  All said and done I paid $17k and got a great financing deal from Ford.

The day after buying the car I took it out for 400 miles of open road.  We have been enjoying it ever since!
