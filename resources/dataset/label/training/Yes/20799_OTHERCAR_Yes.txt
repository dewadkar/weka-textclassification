            I don't have one of these Lexus's but I know somebody that does have one. If I had enough money to buy one of these vehicles I surely would buy it. It is really nice.  I ride around in my friends vehicle a lot and I have even drove it a few times.  It is a very nice and quiet ride.  It is comfortable and very roomy.  This car can also get and up and go if you know what i am saying.  It doesn't get that good or bad of gas mileage but it isn't really really bad.  It is about the same as any other car you would buy.  I would recommend this automobile to anybody that has a lot of money and is in need of a car.  The safety of this vehicle is excellent and so is about everything else.  When I get some money I think I am going to get me a Lexus.  I don't know if I would be able to afford a brand new one like my friends, but a used Lexus would do just fine for me, right now.  It has a big trunk space, so you can put about anything you want back there.  Even though this car is expensive, it is worth every penny and then some.  <br><br>
