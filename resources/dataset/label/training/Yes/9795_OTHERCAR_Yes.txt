            In other countries, the Del Sol is known as the CRX 3. After all, what is different? A Del Sol is a 2 seater car, sport car, from Honda, like the CRX. 

Let's talk engine: that'a 1.6 liter 4 cylindre in row, giving the wheels an amazing 160 hp! It appears on the 0-62 mph: 6.9... pretty nice isn't it?  All this possible because of the VTEC engine. The first four speed are a real pleasure, just have to listen to the music. Wonderful sound! But when engaging the 5th, the rpm goes down and the show's finished... The brakes are not enough powerful (surprisingly there are 4 discs...). We wouldn't believe the shocks are from a sport car, because it's too soft. The effect is amplified when you get off the roof, because the frame works a lot to compensate. If you want a comfortable car, that's yours!

What about the exterior? All this is about opinion. It looks like a little Civic DX. The rear lights are very similar to Civic's and the little lights on the front give it a special look.

The interior is well organized, all is under the hand when we need it. The shifter is precise and fast. But when we come to reverse, it's complicated because of the difficulty of vision we have behind. You must understand that we are like in a cock in those seats! Which are comfortable, though.

I hope this helped!
