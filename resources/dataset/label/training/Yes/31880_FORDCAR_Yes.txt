            I currently drive a 1997 Ford Escort and I am quite happy with it. I did not think this car would hold up as good as it has over the years. This gets gets a lot of miles put on it daily and we rarely have any problems with it.
I liked the car because it was inexpensive however it does not look it. This is a nice looking car. The interior is also nice looking. The seats are comfortable to sit in even on those long car rides. For a small car there is a lot of room in both the front seat area and back. There is also a spacious trunk. The back seat also collapses for extra room in the trunk.
As with most cars you have the automatic lock and window option. I like the automatic windows because from the driver seat I can control the back windows. Also with the automatic locks I can unlock the door with a control on my keychain. I do not have to worry about trying to get the key in the hole. Being a woman this is a real good feature. If you were ever in a parking a lot alone you can get right in your car with out worrrying about stumbling to unlock the door with the key.
Like I said before I have not had any problems with the car since I bought it. The only time I have it in the shop is for a tune-up or inspection.
All in all I was very pleased with the car. I did not expect it to hold up as well as it has meaning as though I did not pay that much for it.<br><br>
