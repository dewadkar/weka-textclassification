            The canon S-10 is a small, stylish little camera with big quality pictures. At 2.1 megapixel your getting some real quality in your pictures from a camera thats almost as small as an elph. You can put it in your pocket. It uses a whole range of compact flash cards and micro drives to store lots of pictures. Viewing and playback is fast and easy, with a little magnifier feature to zoom in and check out that picture nice and close. If you dont like it, its a snap to delete and click again. Make sure you get the rechargable batteries at least 2, cause like all digital cameras, if the LCD display is being used is eats up battery power. Yes you can turn off the LCD display and use the viewfinder for taking pictures, and save batteries.

I pondered this purchase for months, and have been so pleased, wished I had bought it earlier. But with prices continuing to decline, I wish I had waited! In addition to the camera, I purchased the AC adapter/rechargable battery pack, an extra rechargable battery, and 48 MB memory. This setup has been more than adequate. Have not used AC adapter at all because downloads through USB are extremely fast, and rechargable battery holds charge for weeks. Have read too much whining in reviews about the rechargable batteries not being included -- just an extra $70 -- anticipate it and buy it. Many other cameras do not come with rechargable batteries either. And while I was hesitant about the Canon-specific battery, I believe it may last longer than the more standard NiMH AA batteries. I have used this camera as a point-and-shoot camera that has replaced my conventional (film) camera. I tend to scrutinize the quality of the digital pictures more than I ever did from my conventional camera. Overall, I think the picture quality is better, but I do get more blurred shots. Believe I may be able to fix this with some of the manual settings, but my solution so far has been to take many shots -- it's so easy to delete the extra. My 5-year-old has used the camera extensively and effectively, having some of the most photographed pets and toys of any child. Lots of junk pictures to delete after these photo sessions, but some real gems in the midst to keep forever! My bottom line is that I believe that digital technology is changing rapidly, and I have no doubt that this camera will seem low-tech and totally inadequate 5 years from now. But for now, the value/cost ratio is good (cost is currently under $400 on-line), and I don't see any other cameras out there that I wish I had bought. I had first seriously considered ones in the $900-range, and am very glad a scaled back to this one.
