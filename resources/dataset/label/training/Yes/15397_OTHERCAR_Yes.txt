            This camera (albeit expensive) is a wonderful deal in many ways.  First, it uses a floppy disk which costs about a dime and holds about 25-40 pictures.  Second, it is easy to use.  The first time I used it I figured it out very quickly without the manual (it was borrowed from a friend).  I should mention that I am fairly computer literate but I found the controls easy to use.  Third, to use the images is very quick and easy - you can stick the disk into the pc and email or post the images to your website super fast.  You don't have to play with accessories or gizmos to make it work!  

On the downside, it is a bit bulky.  The megapixel resolutions may not be the highest in the world but remember this:  a) if you are emailing pix to friends with a 28 or 56 k modem, you don't want a ton of memory being used!  (very slow downloads &amp; they will kill you, besides Yahoo and Hotmail have a limit on the amount of memory!)  b) if you are doing a website, remember that the viewer only sees images at 72 dpi.  Also high memory pix will take FOREVER to download.  Make the images small (less than 2&quot; dimensions) and the viewer will be happy with your site as it will download quicker.<br><br>
