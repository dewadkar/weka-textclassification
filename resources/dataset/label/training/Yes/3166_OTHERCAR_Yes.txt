            We purchased a used 1995 Z28 with 61K miles on it for $12,300 a few months ago.  The car was for my wife to drive to work and on errands. WHAT A CAR!  WHAT A BARGAIN!

The Camaro is very powerful, fun to drive and is about the best looking car on the road.  I love the T-tops, and the thing is LOADED!  CD stereo with great sound, power everything, keyless remote entry, cruise - it�s a very nice car.  We drove a few with stick shifts before we found this one with the automatic.  We chose an automatic as it's still a kick to drive, but leaves a hand free to steer, hold a cup of coffee or a cell phone if needed... 

It's surprisingly good on gas, 18-25 MPG depending on how and where you drive.  You don�t have to smoke the tires, lose your license and endanger the neighborhood kids to enjoy such a vehicle, either.  Just getting on the freeway can be a rush!  Driving the car hard everywhere you go would be asinine.  It�s hard to enjoy a car you have just totaled, especially if you kill someone (or yourself) in the processes.  This car can get out from under you in a hurry if you are foolish.

Just cruising around in a vehicle that looks this good is fun.  I love driving past goofy teenagers in their useless lowered Hondas with those ridiculous huge exhaust pipes and knowing the wife�s Z-28 would leave them far behind with minimal effort!  The only thing better than actually doing it is going by slow so they get a good look at a REAL performance car and they can hear the smooth, low STOCK V-8 rumble.  All the aftermarket air cleaners, low profile tires, stickers, curb feelers, plastic-chrome tack-on parts, fake cell phone antennas and dorky blue cat�s eye fog-lamps in the world will never make the family economy rice burner into a real performance vehicle.  It feels good to be in USA-1 Steel.		

Just don�t forget that you are buying a sports car.  The back seats are more for bags of groceries than people.  You can put kids (or small adults) back there, but if you have kids this should be a second, or third, car.  The front is a bit cramped as well.  I am 6' 5&quot;, 280 lbs, so I just fit in the thing myself.  

If you are on a rough road you WILL notice the surface of the road coming through and rattling anything not welded to the frame.  Be careful on wet roads, and if you have to drive in the snow, GOOD LUCK.  It�s nearly impossible to keep a light car with 275 HP under the hood from spinning out in the snow. 

We purchased an warranty from the dealer for 36 months and 36000 miles.  Within a week the car died and needed a fuel pump.  It cost us $50.00, but without the warranty it would have been $700.00.  If you get any used car, get a warranty or set money aside for things like this that crop up, and remember that performance cars can cost more to repair.
