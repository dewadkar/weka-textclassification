            I bought the Ford Contour SE because of the BANG FOR THE BUCK that it boast.
I have a family of four and we were looking for a car that was reasonably priced, well equipped , roomy enough for four , good handling and still had a sporty look and feel about it.
     I am really impressed with the responsiveness and smoothness of the 2.5 liter dual overhead cam , 170 horsepower V6 engine , matted with the 4 speed electronic transmission.
     Inside the car you will find full instrumentation ,sport bucket seats , power equipment group , cruise control , tilt , and air conditioning.
     The car is not only a family car , but it is so without sacrificing the  sporty looks and feel that are so important to a man in his late twenties. 
     We have taken the car on several trips and have found that it is  comfortable and has enough room for our family of four .
     So if you are looking for a fun to drive , well equipped , mid sized car I highly recommend the Ford Contour .
