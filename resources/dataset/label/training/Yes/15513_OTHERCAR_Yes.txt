            This review is based on a test drive of a 2003 350Z Enthusiast version with a 6 speed transmission.

I'll skip the hype about the rebirth of the 350Z.  I'll assume you know something about the Z lineage since you're here.  The new 350Z accomplishes performance near the old 300ZX Twin Turbo by a non-aspirated 3.5 liter V6.  Any old turbo lag is gone.  So too, is the outrageous price tag of the old Z.  The new 350Z sells for less than the old 300ZX non-turbo (222 hp), even with many dealer mark-ups.

You should know that the 350Z comes in 5 trim versions.  From lowest to highest: 350Z, Enthusiast, Performance, Touring, and Track.  Each is distinguished by the number of "extras" and performance upgrades.  Each shares the same basic platform and engine.  The Touring version is the luxury version coming standard with leather.  The Track version should probably have its name taken quite literally, based on the suspension of the version I drove.  The dealer I visited was selling 350Z's for $795 over MSRP.  The one I drove was available for about $32,000.  Waiting list was extending until March 2003-it's now December 2002.

Whatever the version you look at, the 350Z is a very capable sports car - not a "sporty" car, a "sports" car.  With 287 hp and 274 ft-lb of torque, the new Z accelerates to 60 mph in just over 5 seconds.  This is world class territory, if not quite Porsche and Ferrari realm.  I found that by utilizing the gearbox a little, interstate jumps from 50 to 80 mph were quick and effortless.  However, these bursts will require a downshift from 6th gear, which is apparently just for cruising.  Some self control is needed to keep the 350Z out of the "Go straight to jail" speeds.  Cruise control is standard with buttons located on the steering wheel.

The brakes were also excellent.  A Brembo system is standard on the Track version, but would be far overkill for street use.

I would compare the 350Z closely to the last version of Mazdo RX-7.  Although the 350Z is noticeably even more capable.  It doesn't have the low end grunt of the Corvette or Camaro, but it's handling quickly makes up over the Camaro.

The suspension is very stiff.  On smooth roads, this translates into incredible grip.  Easily enough to be beyond the limits of most buyers.  On bumpy surfaces, it makes the 350Z jumpy and uncomfortable.  I would not recommend the 350Z as a daily driver.  It's too stiff.  If you're goal is a weekend tourer or racer, than this suspension is just what you're looking for.  On the good side, you don't need to shell out the money for the navigational system - you won't want to travel that far from home in this car.

The interior is snug and generally well done.  There are plenty cubby holes and compartments, but space is tight.  If you require more than just two seats, stop reading now (you may want to navigate over to the Infiniti G35 Coupe).  Luggage space is extremely limited.  Two golf bags fit, theorectically.  Bulky boxes don't fit and neither will tall bags.  That pretty rear strut brace with brushed aluminun "350Z" plate takes up most of the usable space.  I also noticed the interior door panels seem a little too stark and barren.  Overall, the interior is designed for a sports car, not for utility.  Seats are very comfortable and very supportive.

Although it could be only the car I drove, I found the shifter to be too balky.  I found myself consciously (sp?) pulling the shifter in 4th on a couple occasions.  I even missed one upshift because it didn't want to engage 3rd.  Some of this may work out (the car I drove had 800 miles on the odometer) and I haven't seen it mentioned in any other review.  Either way, shifts were very short, but should be smoother.

One other complaint, like so many sports car these days, Nissan goes on and on about passionate weight saving and the use of (expensive) aluminum parts.  However, the 350Z weighs about 3200 lbs.  In my opinion, that is simply too heavy for a car set-up for such obvious sporting pretentions.  It could stand to loose a few hundred pounds.

Summary
=======
The Nissan 350Z is designed to be a true sports car.  It delivers performance equal to or beyond what its reputation and looks promise.  It is not, however, suitable for daily commutes and chores.  So, its appeal lies in your intended use.


Update
======
Looking for something you can use every day and still have that new Z performance?  Consider the 350Z's fraternal twin:  Infiniti G35 Sports Coupe.  Please see my review at <a href="/content_88132456068">http://www.epinions.com/content_88132456068</a>.
