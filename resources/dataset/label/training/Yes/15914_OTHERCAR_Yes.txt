            1989 Mercury Sable LS bought in July 1994 with 100,000 Miles. Car was loaded minus sunroof. I was able to drive the car for 5 years and 5 months before it quit running. This car has served me well and I would recommend a good checking before purchase to ensure all recall notices are done. You can do this by taking the VIN number of the prospective car to a ford dealer and them run it trough their national database. You will then ask then to print the repair history for you

Repair History is as follows: At 131,000 miles I had to fix main bearings, at 158,000 I had to replace radiator, replaced drive shafts at 165,000, A/C quit at 182,00 miles (1999) and I did not fix it, at 185,000 I had to replace sub-frame due to Ford's failure to replace rear sub-frame bolts (this was done free) at 183,000 I had to replace both motor mounts, at 196,000 head gaskets need to be replaced (3.8L) I had the car 5.5 years and paid 5,600 (out the door) for it when I bought it. I do not consider struts, oil changes, brakes, or general maintenance into the above as that is required for any car

1992 Mercury Sable LS bought December 1999 with 100,000 miles initial impressions only: Quality is a lot better than the '89 and that was a good car. Gas mileage is greatly improved VS the '89 (20 for '89 combined and 24 combined for the '92) Ride is a little better and the variable assist steering is a nice addition. Interior noise  is also lowered to a significant degree. I am confident that this car will provide many more years of trouble free service 

Both cars are solid performers with the ability to go through snow that would stop other cars dead in their tracks (I live in Minnesota) Comfort and layout of driver controls are very good except for the location of the horn buttons on the '92. The flash to pass feature is really good and the 3.8 l has enough power to move the car with very little throttle.

People who should buy a used car are ones looking for a backup car or do not wish to outlay 25,000 for a descent new car with a V6. Mercury Sables are the better of the Taurus/Sable twins in terms of comfort and quality with a slightly softer ride and better paint and overall finishing feel  <br><br>
