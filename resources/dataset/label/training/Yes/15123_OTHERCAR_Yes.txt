            I had the pleasure of driving a brand-new Altima for a week while vacationing in Florida in February 1999.  The car had standard cloth seats that had good lumbar support that previous Nissan's I had been in didn't have.  The stereo was above average, but not good enough for an upgrade at a local electronics store.  Ride in city was nothing special for a car this size, but the highway ride was exceptional.  I drove from Jacksonville to Orlando twice and gas mileage was surprisingly good for my excessive speeds.  Air conditioning system was also outstanding in dealing with the Florida humidity.  

But buyers beware, these cars are a favorite of rental car agency's and people who lease vehicles frequently.  Resale values are not equal to other Nissan models.  A good condition Altima only 2 years old with average mileage is an excellent value versus buying new.

My next car purchase will definitely include an Altima in the list of cars to consider<br><br>
