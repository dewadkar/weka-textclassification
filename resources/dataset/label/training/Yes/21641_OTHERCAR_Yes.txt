                 The Acura CL Type-S is a thing of beauty.  Acura as a company prides itself on selling well-equipped vehicles fully loaded with little or no options for a modest and reasonable price.  The CL Type-S fits into this description.  The Type-S comes with all of the amenities from leather wrapped shift knob to leather seats to a wooden trim on the interior.  In addition to that you can add a factory installed DVD navigation system that is paralleled to OnStar*.  
     
     Probably the most appealing feature of the Type-S is it's great engine and transmission.  The engine is a 3.2 liter V-6 that produces 260 horsepower and 232 lbs. of torque.  The car has a front mounted engine and is front wheel drive.  This engine causes you to go from zero to 60 in about 7.2 seconds which is quite good for a car of this luxury and price.  The transmission in this car is a 5 gear Sportshift transmission which allows you to either frive in automatic or really explore the cars potential by flipping the shift knob up or down to switch gears.

     The cars suspension is something else.  It will keep you glued to the road at all speeds.  The reason for this is the VSA.  The VSA is the vehicle stability assist program which maneuvers the brakes automatically on each independent wheel to avoid rolling or spinning out.  This will enable you to go just a little quicker around those tight turns.

     Probably the best feature of this car is it's price.  It is a modest 30,000 dollars, which is essentially loaded and the only other option available is the navigation system for an extra two grand.  Overall this is definitely one of the best performance coupes on the market and should definitely get more attention than the CLK320 from Mercedes and the SC300 from Lexus.<br><br>
