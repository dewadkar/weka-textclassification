            I just purchased my new CLK430 a few weeks ago.  I had placed an order six months ago, but it finally came in.  This car is one of the best cars I have ever sat in, driven, and just looked at.  The response of the engine is fantastic, the handling of the car is fantastic, and the car looks absolutely breath taking.  

I got the car fully loaded with all the options available by Mercedes Benz.  This vehicle is the 2000 CLK430 and it is a bullet, yet it is very elegant.  

I highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking to spend between 58K to 65K on a new car.  

As a personal note I also have a Ferrari 355F1 and a Ferrari 360F1.  This CLK430 kept up with the 355 F1 without any problems.  But in the corners it was no match to Ferrari.

Overall I give this car a true 10 in all categories, looks, engine, luxury, design, power, breaks, inside, and so on.
