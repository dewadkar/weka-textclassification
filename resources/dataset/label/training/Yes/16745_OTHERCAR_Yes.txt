            I had bought this camera because I needed to get all my artwork into graphics files and this was the easiest way to go about it. I set out for the best cheap camera I could find. As a result: The Mustek VCD 3500. It's sleek looking and extremely light (which I don't really like too much, because to me, that accentuates it's cheapness). It advertised 16 images per it's 2mb memory card but that's if you want 16 horrible images that you won't be able to make out anyway (they call it standard quality...standard for abstract photos maybe). Therefore, I keep my setting on fine, which lets me store between 6-9 images at a time. The images are decent. The aren't as good as a scanned image but they're not horrible poor quality either. It does look somewhat pixellated though. 

The battery, there's another thing. It's not a AA but some rare type that I have yet to find a replacement for (being that it ran out of batter in the time that i didn't use it...I only used it a total of about 50 shots). However, I haven't written down the type of battery so perhaps it isn't as hard to get a replacement as I think. 

However, setting up the camera was as easy as cake. It came with a cdrom of drivers and also some generic free graphics editing programs that comes with every hardware you buy. Downloading from the camera is really easy (but a bit sluggish in my opinion) and the twain driver works seamlessly with Photoshop, etc. It has some nice features that most cheap cameras don't have: flash, automatic timer, a removable memory card (which means if you get more of those, you could store more), and a camera case! woohoo

In general, I think it's a pretty good camera for it's price. It would be perfect as a starter for beginner digital photographers or for the computer graphics artist who doesn't have big bucks to invest. Try to get it for $80 or less though.

You can view some sample shots taken with my camera in my website, under portfolio. Most of the pictures of my drawings were taken with the camera.
