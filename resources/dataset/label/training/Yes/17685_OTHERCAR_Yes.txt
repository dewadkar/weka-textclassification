              Recently, I have been looking to buy a new vehicle since my mini van now has 170,000 miles on it.  I have been searching on line and having several companies send information through snail mail.  Several of these packages offered an incentive for doing a test drive.
  Via e-mail Saturn customer service had me fill out a form to get a $25 gift card to do a test drive.  I was sceptical about this but I printed out the form (It had all my information on it: name, address, ect.) and while shopping I stopped at their dealership with my son.
  Car salesman always make me nervous.  I hate the high pressure sales pitches.  I realize these people are working on commissions but I don't like to be pressured into anything let alone deciding on a vehicle.  Well, this salesman was an exception to the rule I would say.  He greeted me and gave me all the important information.  We then went inside and he gave me some brochures to take with me.  Then, he asked for my name and telephone number.  I told him it would probably be awhile before I would make a decision.  He said we don't call and try to pressure anyone.  I was amazed!  Needless to say he filled out my incentive form.  I received it exactly 8 days later!  Now that's great customer service!! <br><br>
