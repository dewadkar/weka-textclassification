            Back in December of 1999, I wrecked my <b>KIA Sephia</b>.  Fortunately this little matchbox of a car was totaled after hitting the bed of a pickup truck at the rate of about 45 mph.  (I have considered writing a review of my KIA, but I don't think I could do it justice since Epinions does not allow profanity.)  We survived for a few months without a second vehicle, but I was three months pregnant at the time of the accident and our Ford Ranger was not big enough to accommodate our impending new arrival.  As my due date approached, I began researching the type of vehicle I wanted.  Not doing enough research was our mistake with the KIA, and I was determined not to make the same mistake twice.  I became ravenous for information about the cars currently on the market.  I read Consumer Reports cover-to-cover and poured over car-related websites like www.edmunds.com and www.kellybluebook.com.  We knew that we wanted a basic sedan, definitely a four-door and something that was reliable.  I was very impressed with everything I found about the <b>Toyota Corolla</b>, except the price.  I was pleased to find that Consumer Reports listed the <b>Chevrolet Prizm</b> as a <b>Corolla</b>, made by <b>Chevy</b>.  The price was considerably lower on the <b>Chevrolet Prizm</b>.  According to Consumer Reports, the only category where the <b>Prizm</b> was beaten out by the <b>Corolla</b> was resell value and since we planned to keep this new car until we drove it into the ground, that wasn't an issue for us.  We decided to check this out for ourselves and test-drove a <b>Corolla</b>.  We liked the interior set up and the handling, but it didn't seem as roomy as our KIA.  (Roominess was the KIA's <i>only</i> redeeming feature.  But hey, who needs roomy when you don't have brakes???)  Anyway, we stopped one day and decided to test drive a <b>Prizm</b>.  We found that in fact they were almost identical in body style and interior set up as the <b>Corolla</b>.  We found the <b>Prizm</b> to be a bit roomier inside as well.  The car we test drove happened to have all the features we were looking for and we drove it off the lot that day.  (At a pretty good price too according to my research.)  That was 18 months ago and I couldn't be happier with our purchase!  Let me give you a little bit of inside information about the <b>Chevy Prizm</b>.

<b>The Look</b>
As I mentioned, we were looking for a 4-door.  The <b>Prizm's</b> 4-door model is not sleek and sporty, but it is not boxy either.  I was surprised that this model does not look like 'your mother's car'.  Our <b>Prizm</b> is all white with black trim.  The trim includes a black plastic strip that runs the length of the car on both sides that protects it from getting dinged by other cars in a parking lot.  (This feature was a <i>must</i> for my husband.)  

<b>The Interior</b>
The interior is gray with dark gray carpeting.  Our <b>Prizm</b> came with four floor mats.  The two front seats are bucket seats with a console in the middle.  The console is where you will find (from front to back) the gearshift, the emergency brake lever and a storage compartment.  The accessory panel is nicely set up.  The <b>Prizm</b> has 4 A/C vents in all, two at the top of the accessory panel and one on either side of the dashboard.  Below the vents on the accessory panel are the temperature controls.  Below the temperature controls is the radio/CD player.  The CD player is not standard on all models, it happened to be in the car we test drove and a feature that we wanted in our <b>Prizm</b>.  Below the radio is a retractable cup holder and beneath that is an ashtray.  (Which makes a nice change holder for non-smokers.)  The seats are comfortable and for the driver, it is an easy reach to get to the temperature and radio controls as well as the door locks and window lever.  The horn is located on the steering wheel.  The driver�s instrument panel is visible through the steering wheel.  Ours is a simple version with a speedometer, an odometer with two trip settings, an oil gauge, a temperature gauge and the typical various sorts of warning and idiot lights. (i.e. low oil, check engine, low fuel, seatbelt not engaged, etc.)  The back seat is not as spacious as the front seat, but this <I>is</I> a compact car.  I have traveled back there when our son was very small and it was not uncomfortable for me, however I am only 5�5.  I�m not sure you could happily seat basketball players in the back seat of your <b>Chevy Prizm</b>.  I have found however, that our rather large car seat fits in the back seat just fine.

The trunk is very spacious for a compact car and has always been ample space for whatever we needed it for.  (I can�t tell you how many bodies it accommodates, but if I find out, I will update.)

The overall look of the <b>Chevy Prizm</b> is excellent.  I have seen our car parked nose to nose with a Toyota Corolla and you could not tell them apart until you saw the company emblem on the grill.

<b>Performance</b>
We originally wanted an automatic 4-speed, however we fell in love with the car that we test-drove and it was a 3-speed automatic.  The salesman assured us that the 3-speed was actually a bit peppier than the 4-speed.  (Not that I am in the habit of believing car salesmen, but I was very happy with the way the car drove.)  I am very pleased with the performance of my <b>Chevy Prizm</b>.  It <B>is</B> very peppy and zips around town quite easily.  The one feature that I always rave about when telling people about my <b>Prizm</b> is the turning radius.  The <b>Chevy Prizm</b> has an unbelievably tight turning radius.  I have been amazed in the small areas where I have been able to do a u-turn.  (And I get lost a lot, so this is a big plus for me!)  The <b>Chevy Prizm</b> offers a smooth ride even at a higher rate of speed.  On the highway it is not unusual for me to look down and realize that I am doing over 80.  

<b>Features</b>
Each <b>Chevy Prizm</b> can be purchased with a variety of different features, but I will focus on the ones that we have on our car.  We have power locks, which I have never had before and now cannot live without.  A single twist of the key in the door opens your door and a double twist will open the whole car.  This is nice on rainy days when your loved ones don�t want to wait for you to pull your key out, open your door and hit the unlock button.  (a few seconds means a lot in a downpour!)  Our <b>Prizm</b> also has cruise control, which comes in very handy on those highway trips when you find yourself going 80.  The cruise control knob is located on the lower right hand side of the steering wheel and it is easy to access while driving.  Daytime running lights are a feature that I am still not sure about.  The purpose is to make your vehicle more visible during early dusk and late dawn hours.  However, if you start driving when it is light and it gets dark, you forget to turn your headlights on.  This is a problem as daytime running lights are not as bright as headlights; also without your headlights, your taillights will not be on either.  One of the features my husband was looking for in our new car was a CD player.  The CD player has a great sound, and we have not had any problems with skipping, even on rough roads.  Intermittent wipers are almost standard on any car nowadays and you will certainly find them here.  The 2000 <b>Prizms</b> also come equipped with brackets on the rear deck to anchor a forward-facing car seat.

<b>Manual</b>
I have found the owner�s manual to be an excellent resource for the <b>Chevy Prizm</b>.  The manual not only includes instructions on how to use all the features included on your <b>Prizm</b>, and also many tips to keep your car running smoothly and safely.  These tips are indicated by a box with a yellow header marked �CAUTION�.  The manual includes information on how to add fluids, change a tire, jump-start your car, and get save yourself from being stuck in the mud.  These and many other tips can be found in the �Problems on the Road� portion of the manual.  The owner�s manual also includes instructions on how to install a car seat, however I recommend you refer to the car seat�s actual owner�s manual for those instructions.  

<b>Closing Thoughts</b>
In the past 18 months, we have put over 25,000 miles on our <b>Chevy Prizm</b>, and it has not given us a minute�s trouble.  The only issue we have had is a creak in the driver�s side door.  It did not present a problem with performance and was solved with a quick trip to the dealership.  (The parts and labor were under warranty.)  We have been careful to perform the scheduled maintenance and be sure to have the oil changed every 3,000 miles.  (Although we have let it go a bit longer if most of those miles were highway miles.)  The roominess and reliability have sold me on the <b>Chevy Prizm</b>. We plan to drive this car until we cannot drive it anymore, then most likely we will head out to replace it with another <b>Chevy Prizm</b>!

Happy Driving!
