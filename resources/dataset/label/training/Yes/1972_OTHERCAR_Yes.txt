                 The 2000 Nissan Maxima is an excellent choice for all those people who want to spend around 25,000 dollars and get the car which looks the best and also performs equally great. I have not had the pleasure of owning this car, but I have spent a great deal of time working on this car with my neighbor who just recently bought this outstanding automobile.  


     The interior of this car is the best of the entire Maxima series.  This is one of the roomiest four door sedans, and this is ideal of long trips with family.  This car can comfortably fit 4 adults, with a very spacious rear and front for all passengers to enjoy the ride.  While they are sitting comfortably, they can enjoy a song on this excellent sound system provided by Nissan.  The version of ht Maxima that I have had the pleasure of driving had extremely comfortable leather seats.  These seats could be heated and electronically moved forward and backwards.  The only problem on the interior is that the rear defrost does not completely defrost the rear windshield.  It does not have the proper lines on the bottom so the bottom quarter always remain frosted.   


     The Nissan creators thought that it was about time that they changed the design of the Maxima, and they changed the shape of the rear and rounded it out more and changed the taillights.  This is not one of my most favorite changes, because I am a big fan of the model from the past few years.  But it seems to be a hit with a lot of people, and i think that it is not really that important with all the other positives that this car has.  


     The engine is very quiet.  The ride is very smooth and quiet.  This car is defiantly a great deal for people looking to spend this kind of money.  I would definitely recommend this to any and all who are looking for a nice quality family sedan with style and reliability.
