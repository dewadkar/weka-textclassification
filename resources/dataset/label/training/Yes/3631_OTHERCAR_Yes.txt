            The pontiac grand prix is an excellent buy.  It has a sporty look with a powerful engine that gets you up to speeds of 140 mph tops.  It has the highly advertised &quot;wide track&quot; which actually gives it great handling.  And the great thing about the car is that despite the sporty looks on the outside inside the car it is quite luxurious.  I comes with power everything except for heated seats (who needs those anyway).  It has a great stereo/cd player with excellent bass.  The driver seat has an adjustable lumbar back support.  A very nice touch.  I would suggest that that if you are looking for either a sports car, or a luxury car, the grand prix has the best of both worlds.  So far I have not had any problems with it.  It is a very reliable car that i would recommend to anyone.<br><br>
