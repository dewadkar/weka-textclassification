            In May of 1999, I decided I would finally take the plunge and get a digital camera.  I had been watching the technology develop over the previous 2 years, and when the latest &amp; greatest 2 megapixels made their debut, I decided I would finally invest and pick up a new camera.  After a good deal of research, I chose the Nikon CP950 over the Kodak DC260 and the Olympus 2000.  Now, after a year of heavy use, I can say this is one purchase that I've been extremely pleased with.

The selling point for me with the 950 was the quality of picture it took.  The images were some of the sharpest, richest photos I've seen.  Additionally, the 1600 x 1200 image size printed photo-quality prints on the high end photo printers, up to an 8 x 10 print.

I'm not a professional photographer, but I appreciate the control the 950 gives a user over the individual settings - exposure settings, white balance, color shifts, etc are all yours to control.  However, the options are extremely overwhelming at first, and you will need to put some time in with this piece of equipment to perfect your photos under adverse conditions.  If you want to keep the photo quality, but are willing to sacrifice some of the extras, look at the stripped down CP800 model.  

Overall, the auto shoot mode works great in outdoor light, but you will want to manually alter your settings when shooting with a lot of shadows, or indoors under dim light.

My one complaint is the underpowered flash.  If you want to take indoor event photos (such as at a wedding, or graduation ceremony), you may want to invest in a seperate flash unit.  It will help you with consistency, and you won't run the risk of having that &quot;perfect&quot; photo completely washed out.

All in all, this camera was a great purchase.  It has traveled well, takes reliable high-quality images and has given me a dimension of flexibility in how I use my photos.  When coupled with a photo printer and an online storage/finishing service (such as clubphoto.com), I'm now able to share my photos in new and interesting ways (such as on coffee mugs or holiday cards) as opposed to simply having them gather mildew in a shoebox.  Since moving to digital I find myself taking more photos, and using them in many different ways (websites, sharing with family, email cards, Ebay sales, etc.)

If you've been waiting to take the jump into digital photography, go ahead - the water's fine.<br><br>
