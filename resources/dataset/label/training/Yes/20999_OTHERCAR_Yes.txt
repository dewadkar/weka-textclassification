            I absolutely love my 1999 Toyota Rav4L, 4 door with 4 wheel drive. I was looking for a SUV but most of them were pretty expensive. I didn't need a huge one, I just wanted a car that brought me up higher on the road for my commute to work everyday and a car (SUV) that would be good in snow. I tested a few different makes but the Rav 4 was perfect for me in price, size, and fuel economy. It is very stylish looking (i got a silver one tone as opposed to the black bottoms, which i think cut the truck in half). it rides like a car, it is very comfortable, and it has bigger tires than the comparable Honda CRV. The model i bought was fully loaded. The gas mileage is much better than most SUV's because it has only 4 cylinders. The drawback of that is it has slow pickup when trying to pass someone on a highway or trying to get on a highway. It has a button that you can push for extra power at those times, but that is inconvenient. Also, the 2 door is extremely small for an SUV.

On the whole, I love it and I'm feel confident in it's reliability since it is a Toyota.<br><br>
