            This car is awesome . I bought it because of its safety and Ford is a great car company . I have a fully loaded one and the sound system is unbelievable . This car is very comfortable . It practically drives itself. It holds the road so well . If you are thinking about buying this car definatly go for the leather seats . The best thing is the remote they give you . it is awesome , it has a button that warms up the car for you so you are not cold in the morning .It has never broken down and we have never had a problem with it .I believe this car would be better for an older person . If you are younger go for a funner car .<br><br>
