            I purchased this on the sale of my 1995 Ford Aspire.  Considering it is the same class of car, with a standard transmission, I expected pretty much the same kind of ride and drive.  I was wrong.  The GS Accent is ten times the car as the Aspire.  It isn't just the extra features like the tachometer, power steering, rear defroster, rear wiper, all cloth seats, 60/40 folding rear seat, or cassette stereo.  It also isn't the extra horsepower (92 vs 70-ish).  The car is simply a better car.  It gets the same mileage (32-25mpg).  It has lots of space with the rear seat removed (four bolts is all it takes).  And the car handles much better than the Aspire with its skinny tires and old-hat suspension.  But this comes at a price, and I learned a month into owning it that when you hit things with the car, it deletes any chances of reselling it.  A lady pulled out from a stop sign and I struck her on the left front fender, maybe 15mph.  My airbags went off although there appeared to be little damage.  The hood was moved about a half an inch, and the left fender was damaged when I tried to open my door.  The passenger airbag shattered the right door window.  The bumper cover was cracked, and each of the lights was tilted just a little bit.  The damage estimate was for over $4000 and you couldn't hardly tell it was wrecked unless you measured things (or looked at the airbags).  The car was totaled and I traded it for a Plymouth Colt Vista wagon.  But I sure did like driving it and given another opportunity to drive an Accent I'll be happy to.
