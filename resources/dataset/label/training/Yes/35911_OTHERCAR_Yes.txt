            I've got the turbo model of the mr2 and it is fantastic. I used to own a 1990 300zx, (non-turbo unfortunately), and the mr2 is better in almost every way. Fortunately, I got one with fairly low miles, 75k to be exact, and owned by an elderly couple so it&#146s still in very good condition. The car is still stock by the way, but I plan to modify it when I get the chance ($$$).

This car is a blast to drive, hugs the corners, light front end, great throttle response, and of course the sound of the turbo spooling when you step on the gas ;).

Believe me when I say this car does boost the ego just a tad. I get looks everywhere I go, especially from the ladies. I love hearing compliments about my car and had many girls hit on me and also a 40 year old woman!!

But besides that, I love this car and performance wise this car is top-notch. Just be careful with this car if you are going to buy it, especially the turbo model, due to the mid engine design because the back end can whip around fast if you are not careful (snap oversteer). Just make sure you test the limits on an autocross or a huge empty parking lot and not on the streets. I know because I have spun out many a time but slowly getting used to it. Just remember to not back off the throttle in a turn since you are going to need traction to those wheels with about 60 percent of the weight in the rear. Body roll is almost non-existent. I'm sure with a nice set of coilovers; the handling would be near perfection. 


The braking in the car is probably one of the best parts. The Z&#146s experienced major fade and the ABS on it was nowhere near as excellent as the MR2s brakes. It is very even about your head does not jerk forward like in most other front engine cars, just a smooth and even feel.


Shifting is smooth and precise; the interior well is laid out with a cockpit view. You would think this car would have major blind spots but it really doesn't, it is very good for a car this small.

Reliability wise is a different matter. It all depends on how you drive it or how it was driven. I've heard of a 91' MR2 turbo lasting over 200k on the stock motor and turbo!! Mine currently has nearly 80k now and the only thing I've had to repair was the master and slave cylinder (450 bucks, ouch!). These cars also eat up the rear tires fairly quick as you can imagine so I recommend a good lasting tire and not something too "sticky" if you are on a budget.

I'm still in school attending college, so I can't do much to this car now except intake, exhaust, a maybe a boost controller, but I love this car to death and will never sell it unless I have to.
