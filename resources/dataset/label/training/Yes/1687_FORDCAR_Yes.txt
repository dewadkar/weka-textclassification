            For the past three years I was driving a Ford Expedition, but it really wasn't big enough. So last spring we went out and test drove some other vehicles, including the Land Cruiser and Excursion.  I LOVE IT! This car holds the whole gang, and everyone has a great view! And...it is really safe!

One of my friends has an Excursion too, and she recently got into a really big accident. Somehow she managed to sideswipe a little car at a major intersection (be careful, these trucks do have some blind spots), and the car ended up crashing and burning...but, don't worry, my friend was fine! She only had a small scratch on her bumper. That's how I know they're safe!

You want to know my favorite thing about this car? I LOVE being able to intimidate other drivers! I ALWAYS drive in the left lane, and love to tailgate little volkswagons and BMWs! So what? They can't do a thing about it! I just sit back with a cell phone glued to my ear and ignore all the horns beeping at me! 

Another great thing is the cargo capacity. Once last summer I had to carry a couple of pieces of luggage to the airport, and they fit in the back seat, try <i>that</i> in a passenger car!

Some people complain about the gas mileage, but it's not that bad. I usually get around 6-8 MPG, and don't mind filling up every week. We have a full service gas station near our 6,000 trophy house (well, there are <i>three</i> people living there, and they are happy to do the dirty work. 

I strongly recommend this truck to all the silly people out there who need a "safe" vehicle, you'll be safe alright!
