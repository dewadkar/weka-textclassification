            	 Recently I bought a BMW Z3 2.3 liter drop-top convertible. Despite the fact that the Z3 is a tiny automobile, the spacing is very roomy. Even a man of very large proportions could fit into this car. Also, the stereo system is amazing. The best part is the bass speaker between the two seats. As you accelerate the bass increases appropriately. The traction is also better than expected. Even in one of the frequent snow storms we have on the east-coast, it had better traction than any Van I've driven. This caught me by surprise. The car as well gets 27 miles per gallon which is quite impressive. The trunk space is of moderate size, enough to fit a couple backpacks, a suitcase, and some groceries. I would especially recommend heated seats because they have helped a bunch during the winter. The automatic top is also a must because it is actually pretty tough to take it down manually. All in all, if you are looking for a great sports car, I give this two thumbs up for price and reliability.<br><br>
