            I've had my Tacoma for 5 weeks and have put 1500 miles on it.
The ride is excellent, even with the off road package.  I thought I would not like having the automatic transmission (manual not available), but it is actually very effective on or off road.  The interior is comfortable and roomy.  Plenty of room for average size adults in the back seat.  The V6 engine is plenty powerful whether driving on the interstate or pulling uphill through the mud.  Four wheel drive is very smooth while engaged and engages without any hesitation.
My truck has power windows, locks, mirrors, adjustable steering wheel, etc.  I find these amenities to be very convenient.
Make sure you get the Toyota "Snug Fit" camper top.  It really makes the truck look stylish, almost like an SUV.
I purchased the vehicle after owning only Fords for 30+ yrs.  My wife has a Toyota Sienna minivan that we've been very happy with, so I decided to look at the Tacomas.  After comparing to other pick-up, the choice was easy.
I enjoy driving this vehicle.  It is comfortable, has plenty of power and feels solid and safe.
I wish the bed was a foot longer, but I have managed to haul some loads (lumber) longer than 12' feet using weights and bungies.  I don't think it will be as restrictive as I thought it might be.
The sound system is decent.  Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worse.
I can't think of anything I strongly dislike about this vehicle.
