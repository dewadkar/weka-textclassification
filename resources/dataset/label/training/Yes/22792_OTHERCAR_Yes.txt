                 After a year of driving around scared to death that my 1988 Ford Taurus with the falling out transmission, doors that wouldn't lock, and broken seat belts, i decided it MIGHT be time for a new car.  

     I went to many car dealers but I was still in high school so i couldn't find too much that was in my price range.  On my first trip to the Hyundai dealer i knew that this would be the place for me.  Nice cars that were (most importantly) cheap!

     I got an Accent with no extras- no power windows, locks, etc. Things I don't particularly need.  At only $194 a month it was a definite bargain to me after being told other places, &quot;I can't get it below $250.&quot; 

     I'm pretty tall so I wasn't sure how a compact car would work for me, but I was quite surprised with the room in the Accent.  The front seats have more than enough leg room, there is also plenty of head room.  The backseat may not be too comfortable for those who are well &quot;vertically enhanced&quot; but its good for what i use it for-holding school books :).  

     So far I haven't had any serious problems with my Hyundai.  Nothing that I couldn't just drive over to the service department and have it fixed in practically no time.  The Hyundai has an outstanding warranty and usually anything (which is little) not covered by the warranty isn't to terribly expensive to fix.  

     The Hyundai Accent is very easy to drive (no matter how FAST your going, trust me :)  It's a very smooth and quiet ride.  Even the factory sound system in the car is better than many others i have heard in other cars.  

     Overall the Hyundai Accent is perfect for anyone who perhaps can't quite afford their 'dream' car but is looking for something nice and reliable to get them from point a to point b.  With gas prices so high and steadily rising it's comforting to have a car that doesn't guzzle down the gas.  I absolutley would recommend this car.<br><br>
