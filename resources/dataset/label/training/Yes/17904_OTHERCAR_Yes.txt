            After test a variety of domestic and import S.U.V.'s, I found this to be the best all around and a fair price.
The Mountaineer AWD holds the road extremely well. I found others had a tendency to lean over more on sharper turns. 
Seating is comfortable with standard leather interior. Plenty of leg and head room even with a sunroof. Heat &amp; A/C work real well.
Plenty of options including auto headlamps, cd player and a great BOSE sound system. My family of four is always comfortable, and the kids enjoy listening to their own music in the rear seat with their own controls.
This is the first winter I had to drive in the snow it does great. Got through everything so far.
Gas mileage is good despite what they say about AWD. The engine is powerful and moves you need it to. Pulls it weight well when hauling a trailer which I have dome on many occasions.
Even my wife likes driving it. No doubt I will lease another one when this is up. See for yourself and take one for a test ride. 
Also, a big plus, recommended service every 5,000 miles, not 3,000. SO far only have oil changes and tire rotation. No mechanical difficulties and I'm past 32K.
If you're looking for the ride of luxury car, don't buy it. But if you want a SUV for a fun family vehicle, this is the one to go for.  <br><br>
