            My Jeep was the first car I bought out of college and I will not be giving it up any time soon. The reason I bought the car was because that's when it was the &quot;thing&quot; to do back in '95. I'm so glad it turned out to be so reliable. 

I haven't had any issues with it besides the splash guard in front, it has been torn off. It probably needs a paint job, just because I haven't taken care of the outside like I should. Waxing a truck that size is a little hard for a 5' woman. 

Anyway, besides regular maintenance, it hasn't had any problems. The four wheel drive has came in handy during the winters, that's really the only time I use it. It's paid for so I'll be keeping it until it falls apart, which I don't see happening anytime soon. 

Lots of room for the kids and all their stuff, plus I feel safer in it than a sedan. There are really no blind spots when driving. Too many features to list, definitely worth the investment.<br><br>
