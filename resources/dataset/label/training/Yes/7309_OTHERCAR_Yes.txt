             Let me start by saying that this camera is my first digital so I dont have much to compare it to. I do however know many people with other brands of digi-cams and we have all compared notes and images and it is unanimous that I made a very wise purchase!
 I really love the results I get when I use the camera on its shq mode, edit using adobe software  and print using hp 970cse printer with matte photo paper. The macro feature has already been very helpful taking pictures of coins and stamps and the 12 second delay timer is yet another great feature! Last but not least the multiframe mode is a breeze to use and with a steady hand gives you great results.
 The zoom is a must have for me and this camera delivers better than average clarity and crispness even at lower resolution. I would really love the quick focus feature but it isnt really that quick when you have to look where to put your finger! It  does eat batteries with the display on but its nothing that a couple of sets of NiMh rechargeables and a charger cant fix. 
 If you still got a few bucks left get the ac adapter and a usb card reader and maybe a 32Mb smartmedia (at least 16Mb) and you are golden. The plastic case worries me a little but as long as it doesnt fall it should be ok.
