            I just have received this camera last month for my birthday from my parents. this camera
is one of the greatest cameraï¿½s i have ever owned. I have always been impressed by
Olympus cameras, especially the features vs. size (like the Stylus series). I had a Nikon
700, but resented not having any usable zoom (digital zoom is from Hell!). Also, the
N700 gave me Red-eye with nearly EVERY indoor flash shot, no matter how well the
room was lit, or if the subject was looking away. Reduction mode never helped much. I
bought my C2000 as a display model at Circuit City, for $600 with an extra 16 meg card.
I tested the Olympus in the store, by taking the salesman's picture, point blank with no
reduction mode applied. He came out fine. I tested it on my kids- again, no red-eye. The
colors and contrast were visibly better than the Nikon (which I also tested in like manner,
since I had it with me for that purpose). I had read the reviews on this camera before
seeing it in the store, and I felt that the issues were trifles compared to its functions. So
the lens cap falls off- it did so on every SLR I have owned as well. A cap-keeper for
$2.29 cures that. Yes, the power button is in a stupid location, but I got used to the
location of the shutter button in no time. I use this camera everywhere, including work,
where I shoot photos for process documentation. I love the zoom on the LCD display- it
really helps me to edit my image folder when in the field. I also love the fact that it
doesn't &quot;time out&quot; on me if left alone for more than 5 seconds, like the Nikon did when
using batteries. I DON'T like having to scroll for flash options, but Olympus fixed that on
the C2020, and I can live with it on this camera. I reccomend this camera for anyone,
unless you need a fast shutter speed for outdoor sports action, or unless you need the
less-than-an-inch macro lens of the N950 (however, I have use a magnifiing glass in front
of the lens, with amazing results!). If you use Nimh batteries, and know how to
manipulate the resolution of your photos on your PC, you can get good photos on most 2
Megapixel cameras. On this camera, you get GREAT photos.<br><br>
