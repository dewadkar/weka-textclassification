            Who knows perhaps we have been spoiled in that we have owned Saturn's for so long.  I got use to going to a car lot and having my requests to not be bothered respected while I considered my options.  What I can tell you I have partaken in an experience I never want to experience again.

Let me explain what led up to the discussion that we would someday soon need to purchase a truck, SUV, or a large van.  We love our Saturn but it just doesn�t have the towing capabilities that we require.  We have a boat that is pretty good sized.  While we have towed it very short distances with our Saturn it just isn�t a safe thing to do and if the boat ramp is too steep we just can�t launch.  We have never tried to tow anymore than a few miles to a local lake.

Another reason we are considering purchasing a heavier vehicle is that it is just getting to difficult for me with my spinal problems to lower myself into our Saturn.  So shopping we will go.

One lot we spent a great deal of time at was the Ford lot at the Stockton Auto Mall in Stockton CA.  We were immediately approached by a salesperson by the name of Hector.  We ask that he explain our options in pickups, vans and SUV�s and then let us alone so that we could explore those options.  We requested his business card so that if we did decide to purchase we could contact him.  Everything was fine, for a very short period of time.

We began our search with the F150 4x4 Super Cab.  We�re not real sure if we really need a four-wheel drive but we are considering all options. One thing we have decided on for sure is that we want an automatic transmission this time around.  We are just past the point of shifting through turns.  If we get an urge to do so we will always have our Saturn.

The truck is handsome and rugged looking.  There is an outstanding assortment of colors for the exterior of the vehicle.   The colors include Arizona beige, chestnut, toreador red, bright red, oxford white, deep Wedgwood blue, island blue, silver, dark highland green and black.  I think if we do go back for this truck it will be the deep Wedgwood blue.

About the time we really got serious about this truck a second salesperson approached us.  We politely explained to him we have already spoke and committed to Hector.  He continued to push.  We got annoyed and simply asked him to leave.  We were looking at the truck from top to bottom thinking seriously of giving it a test drive.  About this time a third salesperson approached.  Now this guy was darn right pushy.  We just plain could not get rid of him.  We explained we were already working with one of their sales people.  He still pushed for the sale.  What a bunch of cutthroat sales people at the Ford lot.  I think Ford could very well take lessons from Saturn.  It left a very foul taste in our mouth.   

We compare the differences between the V6 engine and V8 engine.  We have settled on the V8 for better towing power over the mountain passes.  The base price of the pickup was $26,500.  Adding the V8 will cost an additional $800.  Now we had to consider the transmission.  We knew we wanted the automatic.  We found an electronic 4 speed automatic for an additional cost of $1095.  This particular transmission had an overdrive.  Which will hopefully help a bit with fuel economy considering the crises in fuel prices.  The suggested miles per gallon are fourteen in town and seventeen highway so we could seriously use all the help we can get with the overdrive.  

The optional off road equipment group is another additional $995.  This equipment group includes p265/7ORx175SL OWL all-terrain tires with 17� cast aluminum wheels, skid plates (fuel tank, transfer case and frame front cross member); HD shock absorbers, 3.55 rear axle ratio, and oh goodie! An off-road decal!  There is a single electronic switch to shift into 4-wheel drive.  One time I had a 4-wheel drive we had to get out of the car change some do-hicky on the wheel and then switch into 4-wheel drive.  Then I had a Ford Tempo that had 4-wheel drive it was simple to switch over but the vehicle spent more time in the garage having the 4-wheel drive features fixed.
An optional piece of equipment we must have is the $350. trailer towing group which includes a wiring harness with a 7-pin connector, frame-mounted hitch receiver, heavy-duty electrical/cooling group which is required towing over four thousand pounds and heavy-duty shock absorbers.  The heavy-duty electrical/cooling group is a 72 amp-hr battery, super engine cooling, and auxiliary automatic transmission oil cooler.   The 4-pin tow-wiring conductor is standard.

We had tried one Ford truck at this dealership and I had a heck of a time getting up into it.  With this 150 it wasn�t difficult at all.  The only truck I have driven a great deal was my father Dodge Ram diesel and that is one rough riding truck.  The 150 even with the heavier suspension rode much smoother.  In fact I was rather surprised.  It cornered better than I had expected it to.

The interior is set up rather nicely.  It has a convenient console and storage compartment in between the front seats. The console has two convenient cup holders. One thing I never liked about pickup trucks was the fact that we couldn�t carry passengers.  With the super cab we will have a backseat.  The legroom wasn�t too bad.  A nice feature about the backseat is that it too has a console with an armrest.  Very few backseats in any vehicle are set up for comfort.   I think I would also like the sliding rear window as an option.  Just looks like a handy item to have.  Also the optional cab steps were on the model we looked at.  I would have to have these!

Overhead is a compass, outside air temperature indicator and storage for the garage door opener.  This is a rather nice feature.  We live in a gated community and are forever fumbling for our gate opener. There is also speed controls and tilt steering. The driver�s seat has a lumbar adjustment which is nice for long trips.  The bench seats in the Dodge Ram can get mighty uncomfortable.  We really enjoy the lumbar adjustment on our Saturn.  The air is standard equipment as is the power windows and power door locks.   



The pickup bed has a standard removable tailgate.  The bed has a protective bed rail and tailgate horizontal pockets and vertical slots in the side paneling.  There is also tie down hooks.

This Ford truck has lots of safety features such as the SecuriLock Passive Anti-Theft System, the second-generation driver and right front passenger airbags and the 4-wheel anti-lock braking system all standard features.  Another impressive standard safety feature is the child safety seat tether anchors.  I like the remote keyless entry.

The audio system had nice rich tones with the premium AM/FM stereo and single CD player.  A 6-disc CD changer is an option I rather not have.

The Ford new vehicle limited warranty states that you will receive bumper-to-bumper no-deductible coverage for 3-years or 36,000 miles.  You will also receive unlimited-mileage no-deductible corrosion perforation coverage for five years.


One of my concerns about buying a Ford is there less than stiller last place in lemon law disputes.  Ford also placed will below average in the JD Power and Associates annual sales satisfaction survey. Another of my concerns is they show little integrity in their salespersons cutthroat behavior.  The question is do we want to wait another thirty days just to find out what the Saturn�s new SUV towing specifications are going to be?  Then wait until the fall of next year to even be able to purchase the new SUV if we can even tow a decent sized boat with it?  Are we going to need perhaps even a bigger truck than the F150 4x4 Super Cab?  I honestly believe that Ford could corner the market if they just put a bit more into customer relations, and standing behind their vehicles 100%.  How many people are turned away by the poor display of behavior on the car lots?  How many people purchase another brand because of Ford�s long time poor results in lemon law disputes?  An awful lot to consider before purchasing a vehicle to tow with.

The F150 4x4 Super Cab is beautiful and rugged.  In fact I love the looks of it and the handiness of many of its features.  It rides more like a big car than a pick up truck.  The four-wheel drive is easy to use. But I just have to many concerns to sign on the dotted line at this time.
