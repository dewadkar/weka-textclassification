            I got my 1993 MX-6 at 123k miles and it now has 141k miles on it and still running as strong as it was when brand new. It's the LS with a 2.5 litre V6 putting out 165HP and 160 pounds feet of torqe which is more then enough for most people out there considering the cars 2625 lbs curb weight. I strongly advise you to stay away from the automatic they are known to leak and lock up costing you well over a thousand $$$$ and it's slow bulky like shifts tend to make the car very boring. As far as the engine choice goes anybody with commen sense should definatly go for the LS V6 model because it lasts much longer it's quieter and doesn't have to be pushed hard to go fast and it loves to rev all the way to it's 7000 RPM redline, the LS also comes with 15" wheels wrapped in V rated tires that can safely handle triple digit speeds all day long but the car begs for bigger and wider wheels and tires, as soon as I got 16" wheels 2 sizes wider then stock tires and got the car lowered 2" it made it look 4 times better and handling was seriously improved, I also have adjustable shocks on it, so it loves to hug turns at high speeds. Bottom line stay away from the 4 cylinder and the Automatic if you can't drive stick... learn! It's worth it trust me. As far as the competition goes the MX-6 wins in everyday driving comfort and ride, quality it also scores high if it's well taken care of this car doesn't like to be abused if not taken care of it loves to burn oil (all Mazda's do) when buying a V6 take the spark plug wires off and see if there's any oil in the spark plugs, if there is don't buy the car it's not worth fixing and means that the car was not taken care of. A good 1993 LS model can be found for 3 to 4 Grand (no more! or it's a rip off) it's worth while to spend money on this car and customize it to your taste because it will last if you care for it. Having a civic, 240sx, Mustang 5.0, the MX-6 is by far the best car in every category, the only complaint that people have about this car is the small back seat, let's be honest here if you're looking for a large back seat in a car then why the hell are you reading a review about a sports coupe made to have fun for 2 people, not impress people with kids that are used to driving Camry's and Caravan's. This car gets an A  from me for value, performance (still could use more), style, quality, and everyday use for a 2 person household. It's other obvious problems is that the weather seal on the doors rot within 10 years and wind can be heard at highway speeds, it does have some rattles usually from the plastic dash when going over bumps. But hey you can't expect a Lexus like ride for around $3500 so don't be too picky.
