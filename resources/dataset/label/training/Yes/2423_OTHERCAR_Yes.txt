            I have owned my 1995 Jeep Cherokee Country since 1994, when it had seven miles on it.  It is the luxury version, with leather seats and overhead console with compass/temperature, sunglass holder, garage door holder.  It has power windows and locks and mirrors, a window lock on the driver's side that can be used to keep other occupants from rolling up/down their windows, and a power seat adjuster (up/down, front/back, tilt) for the driver.

The back seat folds down to make a larger cargo area.  The spare tire has a leather cover to keep the tire from getting things dirty in the back of the car.  The only con about that is that you have to unscrew the release for the tire and lay it down to check the air pressure, because it only holds the tire one way (facing the side of the car).

The car has tie-down loops in the back, to help hold cargo.  The top of the car has a rack with movable cross-pieces to better adjust to the cargo.  There is a windshield wiper on the back window, as well as a defroster and windshield washer fluid release.  The back window does not go down or open at all.  

Four of the seats have shoulder/lap belts, the only one that is only a lap belt is the middle back seat passenger.  The back of the front seats have pockets for books, maps, etc, and there are pockets on the inside of the front doors for easy access to maps, etc.  The glovebox locks, although the armrest/extra compartment doesn't.  It has four-wheel drive capability, and tows a horse trailer with two horses well.  It has anti-lock brakes and is smooth to drive.  

Mine is getting close to turning 100,000 miles and has driven across the country as well as to work every day.  The only problem I've had is the driver's window rolls up slowly.  Other than that, maintenance entails oil changes and new tires once in awhile.  I'm just now starting to put money into it, and mostly I'm doing preventive maintenance before anything gives.  

I've replaced all the hoses and belts, bought new batteries, and replaced the alternator (wasn't broken).  The coil died last week, and together with a new battery was only $250, including labor.  Soon we'll replace the starter (again, just a precaution, nothing lasts forever).  Most of the money we've ever put into it was for preventive maintenance.  This car has only been towed once, last week when the coil went and the car wouldn't start.  

It's been a really dependable car for me, a woman driving alone across country, so I've had no worries about breaking down.  The paint has held up well with occasional wax jobs, the a/c has always worked well (important in Oklahoma), and it's always been able to get me from point A to point B with no worries.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this Jeep to my best friend.

Okay, my Jeep is now a little over 105k.  It's Aug. 2003.  Last month my motor mount broke.  Cars will not "go" with a broken motor mount. $5 in parts and $200 in labor.  Supposedly common in older cars, but what a pain in the you-know-what.  Now here's something weird:  last week, the little plate around my controls for the windows fell off (it just sticks on)--not a big deal, but what is: the controls are moving back into the door, to where I can't reach them unless I grab one of the controls and pull them all forward with one hand and work them with the other!  I guess I'll have to unscrew the plate and try to grab them somehow and maneuver them back into their slots so they'll stay where I can reach them and be able to control my windows (and door locks!!!).  ???????  Other than those minor hmpfs, still driving strong!!!!!
