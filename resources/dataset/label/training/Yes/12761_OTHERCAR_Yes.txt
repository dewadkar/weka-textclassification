            We bought the Fuji mx2700 about 3 months ago.  We have been very happy with it ever since.  The quality of the pictures, the ease of use, and the color display make its price worthwhile.  Its also quite compact, which makes it fit nicely into a shirt pocket.  We have used the camera for family photos, pictures of our dog, and landscapes.  Each time, pending we got a good shot with no obstructions like trees in the way etc, the pictures came out great.  The color is right on target and the quality is very good.  Its very easy to use, and the documentation provided is quite good too.  We have not had any problems with the camera, and all necessary equipment is provided.  The beginner user to advanced can use this camera.  Its autofocus, with a lot of nice options for different lighting etc.<br><br>
