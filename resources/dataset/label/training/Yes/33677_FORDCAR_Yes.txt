            <b>~Update 30 Dec 2003~</b>
After five years three months and 72000 miles, the car is gone.  I was involved in an accident, which resulted in the vehicle being a total loss.  Luckily no one was hurt, as I had my kids in the car at the time.  
In the time I owned it, the vehicle had a grand total of two problems. One was the before mentioned AC, which was a relay module ($220).  The second was a bearing in the water pump that had to be replaced ($370).  Not bad for a car that has driven me all over the U.S. and also been a daily driver for over five years.  It will be missed.
<b>~end update~</b>

I bought this vehicle because it was everything I wanted.  It was affordable, sporty, economical and had pretty good performance.

<b>Reliability</b>
  I have now owned it for 2 years and still love it.  It has 50,000 miles, and I have not had a single problem.  
At the three year mark I finally had the first problem.  My air conditioning quit working on a very hot day, making me quite upset.  Spending a couple hundred dollars to replace the relay module wasn't exactly nice on the budget, but considering the vehicles past reliability it is worth it.  Also it is near the 60,000 mile mark, which means it is time to replace the serpentine and timing belt.

<b>Economy</b>
I get 30+ mpg in mixed driving and can stretch it to about 35-38 as long as I keep it under 65.  Seventy to 75 yields about the EPA HWY estimate, 33.

<b>Drivetrain</b>
The only engine available is a 130 horsepower, 2.0 litre 4 cylinder DOHC gasoline engine.  It can be had with either a 4 speed automatic overdrive or a 5 speed manual.


<b>Performance</b>
It handles itself very well on the curves, especially with the 15" alloy wheels.  As far as power, this is the only car I have ever owned that I did not have to downshift going up the grapevine to LA.  In fact, the cruise control is rock solid set at 70 the whole way up (barring any traffic getting in the way).  I have taken it up grades as steep as 8% (in West Virginia) without having to downshift. 
According to Ford, the 0-60 times are about 7.5 seconds.

<b>Comfort</b>
The seats are obviously not Lincoln quality, but I have taken several long trips (8+ hour drives) and they are still comfortable.  I can sit in the back seat fairly comfortably, though headroom is short back there.

<b>Things I would like to improve</b>

The cupholders are in an akward place, and getting anything bigger than a medium drink in them is a feat unto itself.  Also, the passenger compartment is not exactly quiet.  After about $60 in sound deadening I no longer have this problem, but this is something that would have to be done by the owner, or in an audio shop.  
Like most newer vehicles, there is no way to change climate control system to recirculate the inside air, except to go to max AC.  Normally this is not a big deal.  Unfortunately every day I drive to work I drive past cow pastures, and they <b>stink</b>!  In the winter the ambient moisture is high, so you have to keep your defroster on to see.  I don't like having to choose between holding my breath or not being able to see.

<b>Overall</b>
This car does have it's faults, but they are far outweighed by it's positives.  
If you are in the market for a fun small car, then this should be your first choice.
