            These trucks are great.  With the 5.7 liter V8 you will never have any trouble getting down the road.  Whenever you need to pass someone, you can do it with ease in this truck.  It also get very good gas mileage for a V8 pickup.  This truck is also very good for towing.  It tows so well, that you will almost forget you are towing anything, because the engine doesn't even bog down.  Everything on the inside is very well placed.  You can access everything without having to move very much.  The radio and all the knobs for your air conditioner are all placed right together for ease.  Another great thing about this truck is the speakers.  My '96 has very good bass and treble for a factory system.  Purchasing this truck would leave you very pleased.<br><br>
