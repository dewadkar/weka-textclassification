            I've had my 2001 Sentra GXE for just over a year now (I bought it in October of 2000, right when the new model year came out.)  I spent a lot of time researching car after car, comparing price, features, warantee, mileage, power, etc.  I looked at Saturn, Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Mazda Protege, and the Volkswagen Jetta.  After driving them all, comparing specs, and agonizing for a couple of weeks, I had it narrowed down to the Civic and the Sentra. Here's why I chose the Sentra:

Better powertrain warantee (5 year/ 60000 mile, vs 3 year/36000 mile). The Civic configured comparably to the Sentra was roughly $3500 more. (I added many options, including alloy wheels, alarm, 6 Disc CD changer, etc.)  The Sentra had more horsepower than the Civic (I don't remember exactly how much more at this point, but it was enough to matter).  And despite the faith and confidence I have in Honda's workmanship and reliability, I also have extreme confidence in Nissan- Based on knowing many people who own Nissans, and having owned and driven one before with no problems whatsoever. Besides, Nissan had finally released a Sentra that actually had cool styling.

I've been quite impressed with my Sentra. It's not a screaming hot rod, but it has plenty of power, and likes to drive fast. It handles very well, even in snow- and we get a LOT of snow where I live. The heater/ air conditioner works well. One of the first things I noticed when I drove it was how quiet it is. There is very little road/ engine noise- very atypical of a car in this class. Even 18,000 miles later, it's still as quiet as the day I drove it off the lot. Cruise control is good on flat roads, but since I have a 5 speed, it doesn't work well on hills- can't down shift. The 5 speaker 180 watt stereo sounds absolutely fantastic! (and I'm a music freak, so that's important.) Gas mileage is about what I expected, around 33 mpg average, but I drove it home from Las Vegas last summer and got well over 40 mpg- pretty good, I think.

Given enough funds, I would have absolutely gone with the SE model instead of the GXE. The SE has a bigger engine, much more horsepower, and a lot of extra sporty features that are definitely worth the payout, if you have the money.  However, I have very few complaints about the GXE.

Here's the bad: the back seat is not built for adult sized people. That's really not a problem for most, but if you have anyone older than about 12 who will be spending a lot of time in the back seat, they will be cramped.  The CD changer is in the dashboard, which I think is really cool because I don't have to get into the trunk every time I want to swap CDs. The problem is that the cup holders are right in front of it, so if you have anything in your cup holders, you have to move it to swap CDs- minor problem.  It's had a couple of recalls, but that's pretty typical for a brand new model.  The keyless entry is a little touchy and I've actually locked myself out with the engine running while scraping snow off the windows- probably operator error.  And finally, just what is that weird compartment on the dashboard for? It's a little odd, like it was meant for something and they ran out of time or money to put on whatever was supposed to be there, so they just made it into storage. It's too small for CDs, you already have a sunglasses storage by the rearview mirror, you can't put gum in there because it will melt, I wouldn't recommend putting a Palm or a cell phone in it, as it gets a lot of direct sunlight.  I keep my garage door opener in it, but I can't quite figure out what it's intended purpose is.

Overall, I don't regret the purchase of my Sentra at all. It's been a great car.  It's not a luxury car by any means, but it's nicer than your typical "compact" car. My friend drives a Civic that's got roughly the same features, and he prefers the Sentra. I agree.
