            I keep it in my pocket when I am with my family. I just snap away. Some of my results are quite good and others are not. It is sensitive to the light. I have got good results in ALL lighting! The beauty is that you can take many pix and delete the bad ones. With a good photo editing program you can turn trash into treasure! I recommend this camera to anyone who likes photography and photo editing. It is an overall good camera.If you have an idea of how to use a camera and have a little experience; this is the one.
