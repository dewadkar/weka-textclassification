            The new Chevrolet Tahoe is a great ride on and off the road.The sport utility vehicle is one of my favorites Ive driven.Ive been in the car buisness for four years and I can honestly say it beats any sport utility Ive got.My wife also loves to drive it even though the size is kind of overwhelming to a female driver at first.It is also the first vehicle that I have'nt felt cramped up in after six to eight hours on the road.We also pull from time to time a rather large boat,it has no problem pulling the boat you feel a minimal loss of power, the sport utility vehicle is also big enough that the trailer your pulling doesnt feel like its driving the suv, your still behind the wheel, which is also unusual for most of the vehicles Ive been driving.Over all I would have to give it an a plus except for the new split rear doors,I believe the old style tail gate type rear doors were better.The tail gate style doors gave you a working space on the end of the suv,where as now they just open up you also lost some space for hauling by changing the doors.All the buttons are really easy and convenient to get to there are no buttons in annoying spots like behind the steering wheel or something like that.I really love the ride,the feel,and pretty much everything on the vehicle.I think this would be a perfect family vehicle plenty of room,it handles really well its something Im not worried about my wife going out and breaking down in.If you are in the market for a suv,in my opinion this is the one you should buy.<br><br>
