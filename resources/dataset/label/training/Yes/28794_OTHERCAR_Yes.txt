            In 1995, I bought a used Lumina Z34, for which I was extremely pleased with.  Over the years it began to give me nickle and dime problems, only problem with that was, a Z34 nickle problem is major bucks!  Compared to the every day sedan.  I was putting way too much money in the car and I knew that. It had worn out!  I wore it out!  It was a wonderful car, but had seen its better days!  

I told my mechanic, I am getting a new car, can you please tell me what I can get that will not make you get upset and cost me a heap of money to fix when it breaks or doesn't brake!??!  He said &quot;just don't get a Lumina!&quot;  Well, I listened, and I listened well, I bebopped on down to the local Chevrolet dealership and drove off the show room floor a brand new 1998 dark blue Lumina!  Four Doors!  Handles work!  Oh wow!  I was sitting on the ground driving, and I had warranty, baby!  Xtree!  75,000 miles of blissful warranty!  

It has been 14 months since I drove off that floor, and sported home my new car, and it is the most perfect, well balanced, great performance, dependability, reliable and durable car I have ever drove.  I have been driving for about 30 years, and it is the best for the money.  

There are days that come and go and I am most thankful that my Z34 fell apart in my hands, cause if it literally had not, I would probably still be nickel and ten centing myself to fix it.  

Go now!  Get you that Lumina, its like a rock!  Solid!  Firm!  Tough!  Mine!<br><br>
