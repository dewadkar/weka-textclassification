            I was choosing between a Prelude, an Eclipse GT, Celica GT, Solara, Accord EXV6, a VW Jetta GLX and a Mazda Miata.  I owned a 1991 Integra and loved it for 10 years.  I researched and test drove the above mentioned cars and liked them all.  However, I choose a 2000 Prelude because 1) it is a Honda- why should I change after the Integra treated me so well for so long, 2) it is not as flashy as the Eclipse and is more reliable (although the Eclipse is noticeably faster), 3) I have heard from too many people that the Jetta is not reliable (and come on, its a Jetta), 4) I am too young to drive an Accord or a Solara (I will drive these when I have a family) 5) the Celica was just too ugly and 6) the Miata is just not practical (although I loved it and was about to pull out my check book as soon as I finished test driving it- this will be my next &quot;play&quot; car if I ever have such resources). 

The Prelude handles like a true sports car. The sportshift provides me with great pleasure and when there is traffic (I commute between San Francisco and Silicon Valley), I pop it back into automatic and relax.

I do not like the size of the back seat.  But... this is my car, that I bought to please me, and not a taxi.  If I have friends visiting from out of town, I will borrow my brother's Accord.  I also wish the car came with leather seats, especially since I get a shock almost every time I exit the car due to the cloth seats (now I just kick the door shut).  The stereo is average and you have to reach to change CD tracks.  

Despite these drawbacks the car is an absolute must buy for all drivers who really enjoy and can appreciate performance.  Why spend more money and buy a BMW 323i, an Audi A-4, or even a Boxster when you can save money and drive a car that can perform with the best of 'em.  I like the simple interior (unlike the annoying lights and gadgetry of the Jetta) and the car's exterior has grown on me! I really like the rectangular headlights and the &quot;origami&quot; lines on the car are pretty cool.  The car is 100% assembled in Japan (the Jetta is assembled in Mexico), and lets face it, cars built and assembled 100% in Japan are as bullet-proof as you can get.   

I got a decent deal on it- $250 above invoice.

Get this car!  The BMW 323i is for freakin Yuppies.
