            I received my camera as a gift only 2 months ago and I have already taken hundreds of pictures.  I typically use the fine resolution quality and the 8meg card holds 40 at that setting. I have found this setting to be more than adequate. Basic is 80 pictures and superfine is 17.

It is &quot;point-n-shoot&quot; just as advertised.  Very easy to use.  The software used to download the pictures from the PC also has both a great viewing and printing option that can be used with other scanned or digital camera pictures.  

I can view pictures I have taken on a little screen on the back and erase those I don't want to keep.  This gives me the immediate room for more pictures.  The pictures are stored on a removable card which means that additional cards can be purchased. The 8 meg card comes with the camera but there are cards of at least 64 megs that I have seen.  

The camera should come with an AC adapter because down loading to the PC seems to drain the batteries.  Taking pictures doesn't seem to drain the batteries very much but does require a fairly fully charged battery or it complains.  I haven't been able to find an HP-AC adapter so I am going to buy a generic one.  Also I would like another camera-to-PC cable so I can keep one at work instead of carrying it around.  Best Buy doesn't carry these either.

With this camera and my HP printer, I will never have another picture developed.
