            I had always wanted to buy a light truck even though they aren't specifically marketed for women. I bought a Mazda B2500 pickup. I can go through potholes, I can see at intersections, put just about anything in the bed and all of my lady friends want to ride with me to the garage sales. Everyone is surprised at how smooth and comfortable the ride is and how nice it is to have the greater visibility. The price was great too.<br><br>
