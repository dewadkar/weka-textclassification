            The Dodge Viper is an astounding feat of engineering prowess.  It's all-aluminum V-10 engine is a marvel in itself.  This red powerhouse delivers 455 horsepower and 490 ft/lbs of torque.  That matched with 17 inch wheels all around allows the Viper to attain nearly one full G of lateral acceleration on the skidpad.  The only problems I have with the Viper are as follows:  the cabin is rather cramped (no room for the baby), the engine noise is at times a little overbearing, and even with available air conditioning the Viper can seem to get a &quot;rolling sauna&quot; feeling.<br><br>
