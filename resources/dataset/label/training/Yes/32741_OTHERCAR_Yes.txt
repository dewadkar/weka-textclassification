            From the country that invented rock 'n' roll&quot; claimed the advertisements for this Quebec, Canada-built sport coupe
when it was redesigned in 1993. A small technicality, we suppose, but there are no technicalities when it comes to the
Camaro's performance abilities, particularly in Z28 or SS guise. These Camaros are blazingly quick, hold the road
tenaciously, cost less than the average price of a new car in this country and get decent gas mileage when they're not
being hammered along a twisty, two-lane road. 

Two trim levels are available for 2000 in either coupe or convertible bodystyles. Base Camaros are powered by a 3800
Series II V6 that makes 200 horsepower. Mated to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission, this
sufficiently strong motor makes a strong argument for avoiding the higher insurance rates and prices of the Z28. An
optional performance-handling package puts dual exhaust, tighter steering and a limited-slip differential on the V6
Camaro. 

The Z28 is the go-faster Camaro. Equipped with a detuned Corvette 5.7-liter V8, the Z28 makes 305 horsepower, 45
more horses than the Mustang GT. Opt for the SS performance package and you get 320 horsepower (same as the
Mustang Cobra), thanks to forced air induction through an aggressive-looking hood scoop. The SS gets to 60 mph
from rest in a little over five seconds. SLP Engineering - known for working magic with GM's F-Bodies since the late
'80s - supplies the parts to turn a Z28 into an SS.
