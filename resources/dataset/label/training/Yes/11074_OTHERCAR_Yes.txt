            When we were driving in Malibu last weekend, Pierce Brosnan (aka James Bond) creeped a peek at our new 2001 tt convertible!  I knew it was the coolest car out there after test driving the saab, volvo, bmw and boxter, but once 007 himself gave us the thumbs up, I was sure that we made the right choice.  If you can get your hands on one of the new tt's, get it.  It drives like it is &quot;on rails&quot; and gets more looks than a french au pair topless on the beach in santa monica.  The tt is loaded with extras(bose 6 cd changer, wind screen, alarm, and leather), it is chromed out in the right places (check out the peddles and the gas cap), has a huge trunk, and gets more than 30 miles per gallon.  The tt is a smooth ride. There is nothing better than riding with the top down up and down the coast of California in our new tt roadster.<br><br>
