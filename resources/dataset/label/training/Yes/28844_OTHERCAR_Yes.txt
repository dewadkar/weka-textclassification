            This was my first digital camera, purchased in August 1999.  it hooked me on the digital camera concept, but not on this camera in particular.

This model is easy to use.  Point and click.  On board review is nice, and you can delete photos right at the camera if the shot is no good.  The memory that comes with the camera holds 64 photos easily that are good enough for viewing in the internet, or about 8 high quality prints.  Some fun features include built in frames and date printing.

The downfall of this camera is the print resolution.  You can't even print even the better quality photos at bigger than 4 by 6 inches.  I upload a lot of my pictures to ofoto.com to have real prints made of them, and the biggest you can get uploads to come out clear there is 3 by 5 from this camera.

Connection is slow and I had trouble with the camera disconnecting after a certain number of transferred pictures.  The Adobe software that accompanies the camera is easy to learn, but takes up quite a bit of  drive space while in use.  (don't plan on playing a game in the background while you are cropping and editing pictures.)  A card reader, sold for about $30 seperately, is a smart investment... makes for faster upload.

This is a good starter camera, very easy to use.  My six year old son took good pictures with this model.  I put about 1000 pictures on this camera (it keeps count of how many times the camera has been used!) mostly for things I sell on ebay, and this camera is perfect for that.  

Camera is sturdy, I dropped it a few times (oops!) on tile floor and the worst thing that ever happened was the batteries popped out.

Get recharging batteries, this camera eats them in about 60 pictures. (takes 4 AA)<br><br>
