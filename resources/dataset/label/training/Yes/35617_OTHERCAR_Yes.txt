            I bought this car in june of 1999.It is a very affordable mid sized car.It has all of the luxury's of a fullsized car. Nice gas mileage. Plenty of shapes and colors to choose from. The warranty is about the best that I can tell. It can go from Chicago to Jacksonville North Carolina , thats 910 miles. We only used $40 in gas. It handled very good in the mountains. When it rains it does not slide all over the place. The price is low enough for a mid income family to afford it.<br><br>
