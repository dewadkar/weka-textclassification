            After trading in my 95 Legend LS coupe, I purchased a 3.5RL. Still known as the "Legend" in Japan, it has a completely different character than its predecessor; the RL is more luxury oriented. The RL is larger, more comfortable, and has more amenities than the second generation Legend. The only "less" qualities when comparing the RL to its predecessor would be the horsepower and the sport oriented feel. From 230hp in the TYPEII Legends to 210hp in the RL's(96-2001). Despite the decrease, the engine is bigger with more torque peaking at 2800RPM. As for the steering and response, the RL does retain some sportiness to it and it does NOT feel like a huge boat like a LS400 I test drove.

The 3.5RL is an impressive car for the price you pay which includes Acura's excellent record of reliability. As with the Legend, the RL also has power/heated seats with driver�s memory, telescopic steering wheel with audio/cruise controls mounted on it, a supple leather interior, real wood trim, climate control, and power everything. I was really impressed with the extra amenities such as auto on/off light sensing headlamps, one touch open moonroof, electroilluminescent gauges and rear seat A/C vents.

True I was hoping for more in Acura's flagship such as a V8, one touch everything, rear sunshade, and dual climate control. However I remembered that Honda has always been the leader in producing quality cars at a descent price(Look at the current TL and CL's!). Honda doesn�t add too many extra bells and whistles that can increase the MSRP tremendously. With today's rising gas prices, the 3.5L engine offers more than adequate gas mileage. True it may not have the immediate launch of a V8 off the line, however it has more than enough power for everyday driving. The engine really shines when you're already rolling... and you punch the pedal in which the car pulls immediately.

In the luxury segment, I strongly believe the RL retains more than enough features to stay in the game in which Acura has put a lot of time into making it quiet. The ride is so smooth which makes exterior noise virtually undetectable. Even the seats have their own suspension system of sorts in order to enhance the ride.

The only thing I have against the '96-'98 RL is the styling. The '96-'98 design is a bit too conservative for someone my age(I just turned 21), which is why I threw on some 19" rims. Despite the conservative design, the RL is still recognized as a luxury car. However, Acura seems to be making adjustments by looking at their new models. The new lineup makes a bold statement, especially the current RL design which gives the car more presence on the road.

Bottom line; the 1997 3.5RL is an excellent vehicle which I am definitely satisfied with.
