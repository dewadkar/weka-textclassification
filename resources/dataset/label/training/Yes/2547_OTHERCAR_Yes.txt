            We considered the minivan because we needed more room.  I wasn't crazy about the idea until I drove my Montana for the first time.  I love all the room we have.  The kids don't have to sit next to each other.  I love the rear a/c and heater.  Already we have taken the back seats out several times to carry large cargo, and they are easy to replace.  We pull our boat with the Montana.  It has driven from Oklahoma to Ohio and rode very comfortably.  We seem to get about 20 highway miles to the gallon.  I love the color of my Montana:  light blue over taupe.  I love denim and khaki clothes, and my van matches my taste in wardrobe.  You will not regret buying a Montana.<br><br>
