            I bought my Toyota Avalon in the summer of 1997 and I have never been more pleased with any car.  I bought the car because of it's relatively inexpensive price as well as it's impecebale maintenance and road record.  My car came with the XLS luxury package, with leather seats, a CD player, and many other ameneties.  The thing I love most about this car is the way it rides and handles on the road.  The V6 engine accelerates with great speed.  The ride is extremely smooth and I sometimes wonder whether or not my engine is on or not when I am inside the car.  The back seat is extremely spacious, probably more than any car of this class.  In three years I have put more than 80,000 miles on my car and it is still in almost perfect condition.  In all honesty, there is only one con about this vehicle, and it is that it's stereo system rattles a little bit while riding. about this vehicle that I don't enjoy.  A family with one to three kids should consider buying this vehicle.  A GREAT BUY!!!!  <br><br>
