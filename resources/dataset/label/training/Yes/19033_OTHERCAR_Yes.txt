            I am a graphics professional, so having a digital camera that performs well is a top priority for me. I am not, however, a digital camera professional, and the market has so many cameras that claim to be clear, easy-to-use, and high-resolution, how does one decide?

After having owned two digital cameras (my first was the Sony Mavica, which I loved but outgrew), I've learned that different features are important to different people, so what might be a great camera for a professional might be a crummy camera for a tourist, and vice versa. The Olympus 2020 tries to be all things to all people, and comes up a bit short. 

Bottom line? Consumers, get a simpler camera. Professionals: get a better camera. If you consider yourself a serious hobbyist but not a pro, maybe this camera is for you.

Here are a few things that I personally considered when buying the Olympus 2020, and how it fares:

1) I like functionality, but I want a simple interface. 
The Olympus 2020 has quite a bit of functionality, but it is buried in such an arcane on-screen interface that you will have a hard time getting to it. It feels like using DOS. I'm still learning from the instruction manual (which is not very consumer-friendly and reads like it is a translation from another language), and having to memorize a bunch of silly abbreviations. And even after all this, it is missing some really basic features, like manual focus. Also, it takes very short MPEG movies, but has no microphone, so you're left with quaint, but largely useless, little silent movies. 

2) I want a versatile imaging capability, that does well in different light and motion situations. 
The Olympus 2020 does pretty well in this regard. Unlike my Sony Mavica, which degenerated into pixel-blobs in low light, the Olympus 2020 seems to adapt to nearly any light situation. And if it doesn't do it the way you want automatically, you can set it differently, but as mentioned above the interface is tedious.

3) I want my digital camera to be mobile; in other words, small and light, with a battery that doesn't conk out after a few pictures.
One of the things I do really like about the Olympus 2020 is how teeny it is, and how long the batteries last. Also, it takes regular off-the-shelf batteries so if you get out and about without a way to recharge, you can always pop into a gas station and &quot;juice up&quot; with Duracells.<br><br>
