            After my 1988 compact got me reported to the AQMD as being a Gross Polluter (that�s Air Quality Management District for those not from Southern California, and yes, it�s a real agency!), I decided it was time to look for another vehicle.  Being a polluter was bad enough, and while it did smoke a lot (I had to put a quart of oil in it at least once a week), being called a <i>Gross</i> polluter was more than I could take.  Now what to get?

I first set my sights on a used Hyundai (being the father of four daughters, the sole breadwinner, and maybe a little bit of a martyr).  Then I accompanied my mom when she test-drove a new Toyota Echo.  VERY roomy, tight turning radius, and it even has a CD player (what luxury)!  Then I realized no self-respecting man could drive such a stupid looking car.  Even wife admitted she was glad I stopped considering them.  Then I began looking at the Honda Civics�the bottom of the line, of course.  Looking online, my wife saw an EX (top of the line) with a moon roof (didn�t they used to be called sun roofs?), and she commented, �You�d look so cool in a car with a moon roof!�  Hmmm!  I went to drive one at the dealer where the salesman told me that the EX models come with a VTEC engine that�s more powerful and requires no maintenance until 100,000 miles!

I now had plenty of rationalization.  I�d save on maintenance (heck, the manual suggests changing the oil only every 10,000 miles!), a higher-end model would have better resale value, I wouldn�t have to pay extra for a CD player, and that should be plenty of rationalization to justify my real motivation�getting the moon roof to look cool in my wife�s eyes!

I�ve had my 2001 Silver Honda Civic Coupe EX now for about five months, and I LOVE it!

<I>Let me stop and tell you right here that I was born without the automotive gene, so you won�t get a technical review of this car.  Sorry.  I�m just going to give you my experience with the car and what I think of it, ok??</I> 

The engine is very quiet!  As a matter of fact, when I took it to let my friend have a drive, he almost turned the key a second time asking, �Is it on???�  Also, the riding compartment is pretty quiet, too (that is, when I don�t have the moon roof open *grin*).  I enjoy the quiet of the interior when I�m listening to my CDs.  I�ve figured the mileage on nearly every tank I�ve put into the car.  Although the sticker said 32 mpg in the city and 35 mpg on the highway, I haven�t seen anything as high as 32 even when most of my driving was highway.  I average around 30-31 mpg most in city driving (with the air conditioning on).

The pick up is noticeably greater than a typical 4-cylinder vehicle.  That VTEC really does make a difference.  That same friend asked, �Is this a 6-cylinder?�  Then he actually said it felt like a BMW 5-series (I wouldn�t know, ok?).

I got the floor mats (which were extra), but I�m glad I did.  They are nice and thick, and they fit perfectly while also being easy to remove for vacuuming.  The back seat mat is one long piece since you don�t have to maneuver it across the hump in the middle of the floor.  That�s right, there�s no hump in this car!  Isn�t that cool?  Totally flat floor in the back!!!  (I think it�s neat, anyway)

Both rear seats unlock and fold down so you have clear access to the already-spacious trunk.  I haven�t carried anything large enough to need that feature yet, but my skier friends say it�s perfect for skis.  The huge trunk can also be released from a lever at the driver�s seat.

I�m really crazy about the paint job.  It�s metallic silver, and when the sun shines directly on it, it�s like millions of tiny reflectors giving a beautiful sparkle effect.  The design of the car is very sporty.  The taillights wrap around the sides and angle down into sharp points.  The line of the body slants down toward the front.  More than one friend has asked me what it is, and they�re surprised to hear it�s a Honda Civic.

One of my favorite features that you don�t see in cars much these days is free-flowing fresh air!  So many cars now require the fan just to get fresh air through the vents.  On this Civic, the normal setting lets air come freely through all the vents, and a simple button closes it all off when you get too chilly.

The dash lights show up orange at night, which I�m not real crazy about, but I can certainly live with it considering how much I like the rest of the car.  The feature I�m least pleased with is the rear window and the center brake light.  For some reason, the windows tend to fog up, and then a film remains on the glass.  There�s a distance of about an eighth of an inch between the center brake light and the window, and this makes it nearly impossible to clean the window in that area.  Why didn�t they just put the light snug against the glass?

These negative points are minor though considering that I can retract an opaque door to the moon roof leaving tinted glass to see through, tip the rear of the roof glass to allow some air to circulate, or open the glass completely so there�s nothing between me and the sky so that I look totally cool in my new toy!

My wife thinks so, too.  *wink*
