            I purchased my GMC K-1500 extended cab 4 by 4 pickup in June of '99.  It has been a real workhorse. Not only do you get the power of the 350 cubic inch tried and true GM V-8 to haul all kinds of goodies you get a plush interior and a nearly carlike ride. All this and room for up to 6 passengers.  Granted, the back seat is made for kids but it's there if you need it. 

This truck has over 90000 miles showing on the odometer and runs like new. The biggest drawback is the gas mileage.  Anyone looking for fuel economy probably shouldn't buy a four wheel drive fullsize truck anyway. I get about 18 mpg on the highway but only about 12 around town.

I enjoy all the room in the cab.  After driving my Honda Accord it's nice to be able to stretch out behind the wheel with a great view of the road ahead.  

The exterior finish of the truck is very durable with no signs of rust. (They salt the roads pretty heavily during our Maine winters).  <br><br>
