             If an entry level camera is what you are looking for and you are on a budget you should really check this out. I have been looking for a digital camera for a few month's so i could e-mail picture's to friend's and family. In this capacity the DC-T20 is a great buy for the price. 
 
 Two AA batteries are all that power this particular camera and will last quite awhile. (i have taken about 250 shots with and without the flash and the original batteries are still going strong) This camera is simple to operate but takes a few second's to boot (it uses older cmos technology not the current ccd standard) so spur of the moment shot's will only be captured if the camera is already on. 
 
The 1.5 in. lcd screen is clear but a bit dark, thankfully there are brightness settings. Navigating the controls is relatively easy having only four (4) buttons to use one being a five(5) way "hat" style thumb button. The picture quality is good as long as you are not shooting close up. Macro shot's are one of the short coming's of the DC-T20 (in the week i have had this camera i have yet to take a clear shot in this mode).
 
 In normal daylight situation's this camera takes great pictures at 1600x1200 resolution but lack of auto focus can hurt your desired shot. The onboard memory (8 megabytes) will allow only 10 shot's in 1600x1200. In lower resolution you can take as many as 80 (640x480) shot's but the quality will drop a bit as you lower the resolution. Fortunately you can upgrade the cameras memory up to 128 megabytes with a secure digital card.
 
 In instances where you need to use a flash it is not advised that you take your shots past 7 ft. The flash on this camera works well but if you are shooting close up in macro mode the flash shot's off and cannot be used. You can also take
short video clips (up to 45 seconds long with no sound) in 320x200 resolution and the quality is fair. There is a 4x digital zoom (not optical) which is pixelated and not really worth mentioning.
 
 Downloading pictures from the camera is a snap and all the cables you need come with the camera. One option i thought was neat allows you to connect the camera directly to a television and share pictures in a slide show format. You can also use the camera as a web cam but that option leaves something to be desired and i recommend not using it in that capacity.
 
 All in all this really is a good beginners camera for people on a budget. If you want to take simple pictures to share with friends and family i highly recommend this camera. If you are looking for auto focus and other bells and whistles i suggest you don't give this camera a second look.
 
 I personally enjoy using this camera and have no regrets purchasing it. If you are looking for an inexpensive entry level camera i think you will agree the DC-T20 is a good buy for the price.
