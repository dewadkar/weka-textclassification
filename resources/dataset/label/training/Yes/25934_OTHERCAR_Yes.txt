I have had my 99 Grand Am for 2 years now.  I love it.  I haven't had to take it to the shop (except for oil changes) at all.  This is the first time I've had a new car that actually worked perfectly (like a new car should, really).  

The Grand Am is truly a fun car to drive.  It's got a fast engine, and generally takes turns/curves well.  My only qualm is that I don't like how it handles at high speeds (&gt;60 MPH)- I feel that I don't have 100% control.  

The Grand Am also gets pretty good gas mileage.  At around $20,000, it's not a bargain, but it's a fun car for the money.

One note:  this car is definitely NOT for tall people.  I'm only 5' 7'', and find the driver's seat to be a bit cramped- specifically, not enough head room.<br><br>
