            Our Lexus RX 300 has had no problems, aside from my mom crashing it into a parked car.  If you are wondering about the "real crash test," as I call it, the RX 300 did little damage to the other car and only needed a replace front bumper for itself.

The seats are stitched leather with power back/forward controls and laydown controls.  They can get uncomfortable after many hours of being seated, but that is normal for any vehicle.  The back seats laydown forward to add more cargo space to the already lavish amount of trunk space. 

The dashboard screen displays: average miles per gallon, outside temperature, inside temperature goal, CD player/radio options (seek, skip, memory etc.).  The mid-dash mounted screen keeps you in control of the temperature and lets you know what's going on with your RX 300.

The original tires held up well but we recently changed them because we go on off-road trips a lot.    

The glove compartment can hold your car registration, glasses case, and two 6-CD cartridges.  The cartridges are inserted into a port in the glove box.

The windows and locks are power operated and there is a keyless entry system standard.  Our specialized keyless entry key broke so we have to use the regular one.  It probably broke because we got water on it at one of the many lakes we have visited.

It has a trailer hitch that tows our shuttle craft (a boat/sea-doo combo) and the 4 wheel drive never slips, even on sand or gravel.

A cigarette lighter is located on the dash and near the floor in the back and trunk for use when needed.  Seatbelt lights warn passengers when they are not wearing a seat belt.  

The Lexus RX-300 is an all around great vehicle for family vacations including the towing of personal watercraft or boats.  Cruise control also makes this SUV easier to drive on long trips.
