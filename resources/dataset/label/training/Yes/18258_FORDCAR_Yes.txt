            Just earlier this year (2000), I turned 16 a began to look for a car to buy.  I was most definitely NOT a Ford fan, but a little '91 Escort came along at the right time with the right price.  The previous owner showed me its few cosmetic flaws and otherwise praised the vehicle.  A thorough test drive showed it to be mechanically excellent.  I gave in and handed over $1500 Canadian.

So far, the car has handled the expected abuse from a 16 year old male extremely well.  I am the third owner and the third person to learn how to drive a standard on this car, and the clutch still grabs like day one.  The 1.9L engine is very torquey and peppy enough in stock form (88 hp, 108 lb-ft).  I have recently freed up airflow through the airbox increasing horsepower to 96.  A quick (literally) drive through country roads revealed that this is enough power to chirp the tires on a 5th to 3rd downshift at 60 mph!

On the practical side, I filled the tank a month or two ago, and so far I have driven 395 km (~247 miles) on 3/4 tank including my &quot;spirited&quot; driving and lots of idling.  The trunk is large enough to hold most anything you can imagine, and the interior is quite roomy for its size.  I haven't spent much time in the back, but the front seats are moderately supportive and comfortable.

This has turned out to be an excellent car for me and probably other 16 year olds, being cheap to run and maintain, quick and fun without being TOO quick and fun, and all around easy to drive.  I congratulate Ford for making a car that changed my prejudice toward them.<br><br>
