             With digital cameras prices falling so rapidly and often, it is a shame that every one does not have one yet.  
Kodak has one model (DC 280) that will meet the demands of nearly everyone and not draw a vacuum on your wallet.
 
What would appear to be a fair quality 35 mm camera is actually a superb digital camera.

The DC280 by Kodak offers resolutions of 1,760 by 1,168 or 896 by 592 pixels.  The images are extremely sharp and well focused.  I was truly impressed with the quality of shots taken both inside and outdoors. 

 While I prefer a higher storage capacity ( I have seven kids�) the 8MB �CompactFlash� memory card  allows up to 97 standard or 12 higher resolution shots. Usually more than enough for my group shots.

 The simple design, compact chassis, and comfortable size belies it�s durability.  I even allowed the kids to take shots with it.  The camera took the families antics on and continued to produce high quality shots even after a few drops and spills.

 The DC 280 is loaded with features many cameras do not offer, 2X optical zoom provides excellent detail.  The 1.8-inch LCD screen is bright and clear enough for shot selection in any light.  And there are a large number of flash options which make for super special effects.
 
 Included with the DC280  are Adobe's PhotoDeluxe 3.1 and PageMill 3.0 software.  Both provide easy picture editing and correction (which are rarely needed).   Kodak also included their own special drivers to allow you to upgrade your system for proper operation with the DC 280. 

 While I prefer the CD or disc storage of the SONY Mavicas, the Kodak DC 280 connects to your PC via USB.   This is a much more rapid file transfer as compared to the old serial port of yesteryear.  

 I wished that the battery life could be a bit more stout for the DC 280.  I found myself forced to swap batteries after only 280 pictures.  Fortunately I carry extras around because of digital cameras being so battery hungry.

 The best feature is the "Bang for your Buck".  The DC 280 is now fetching a price of (or around) 350 dollars.  Figure in the cost of film and processing and you will pay for the camera in a year.  And I do not think that you can get a better quality camera on the market for a price this low (not yet anyway).
