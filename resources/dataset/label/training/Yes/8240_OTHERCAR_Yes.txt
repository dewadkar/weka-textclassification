            You definitely will not be disappointed by the image quality on the 2800. As has been my experience with all three FinePix cameras I have owned, the 2800 has excellent color representation, especially when using the flash. Many digital cameras fail the flash photo test and produce gray skin tones (e.g. the CoolPix 775), but the 2800 is markedly better. The 2 megapixel CCD sensor produces very crisp images and great prints.

The Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom was the second of three FinePix cameras that I purchased. If you have never seen this camera in person, I recommend dropping by an electronics store to take a look. It's quite a bit smaller that it might appear in photographs on the web. The camera has the styling of a miniature SLR. Despite the form factor, the camera is fully automatic and provides very few manual features.

Obviously, one of the most striking features of this camera is the 6x optical zoom. Most digital cameras in this class are stuck with a 3x optical zoom. If you're new to photography and have never owned a camera with a zoom lens it may not be immediately apparent just what the attraction is. The zoom lens does more than get you closer to your subject, it also allows you to bring backgrounds closer. If you've ever taken a portrait with a cityscape or other feature in the background, you'll know how distant it can seem. Step back another 10 feet from the subject of your portrait and use the zoom and you'll increase the size of the background without reducing the size of the subject.

In addition to a standard picture taking mode, the camera can also be used to take short video clips up to one minute long. The video clips are stored as Motion JPEG AVIs. The resolution isn't great, and the frame rate is low (10 frames per second) but the camera does record audio, which is fairly unique. I purchased this camera strictly to take still photographs, so I was pleased to realize that the movie capture mode can be a lot of fun. Despite their low resolution, the AVIs are the exact same resolution as VideoCD (VCD) video. I had never heard of VCD before I bought this camera, but using some simple video editing software and a regular CD burner I was able to stitch together multiple movies files and burn movies to VCDs that could be played on my home DVD player. Consider the movie mode a bonus.

Despite the small size, you may find it difficult to find a camera case that comfortably fits this camera. Its unique shape and the relatively large 6x optical zoom lens make it a bad fit for standard point-and-shoot camera cases. The camera does ship with a rather thin neck strap.

The camera takes 4 AA batteries. Don't be turned off by the use of AA, they are far superior than proprietary rechargeable that are showing up in a lot of digital cameras. Pick up a couple of packs of NiMH AA batteries and a NiMH charger. You'll get great battery life out of NiMH batteries, they're substantially cheaper than the non-standard LiIon batteries shipped with a lot of cameras (a set of four is around $10), and you can always buy a pack of non-rechargeable alkaline if you run out of juice in the middle Disney World. Also, don't confuse NiMH batteries with the older NiCd batteries. NiMH batteries suffer none of the memory effect problems that plague NiCd batteries and have roughly twice the life (per charge) of alkaline.

Overall, a good value and a great choice for casual picture takers looking for superior image quality in a compact design. If you don't mind a larger form factor and are interested in manual control, consider the FinePix 4900 which offers standard P-S-A-M modes. The 4900 was discontinued, but can still be purchased new on-line for about the same price as the 2800.
