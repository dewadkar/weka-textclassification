            This is my first car and I have had it for about 6 months.  So far, I have really enjoyed it.as with everything in the world there are its share of problems. It has about the power you would expect from a 2.3 liter truck.  it is also amazing considering I have put about 7k on it and it now has 138k miles.

First off, my favorite things about this car is it's mine.  well duh. I like that it gets decent milage.  i get about 19 to 24 mpg, depending on how I feel like driving that week. I got 22.2 this last week, but that is right after being allowed to drive again after my first speeding ticket.  so, about the average adults driving.  If this is a first car for a teenager, I would recomend it.  you can drive off road, but nothing amazing, more like any dirt road, and SOME 4 wheel drive roads. 

A FEW complaints I have are a lack of power.  I find myself in third above 50 MPH WAY too often.  The power would be great with maybe 20 more horsepower.  maybe a K&N intake might be fun :).  I have noticed trouble when shifting into second, it feels real tight, and it grinds shifting into reverse. This happens always, and I always come to a complete stop, and have the clutch all the way in.  I think this may be a bad clutch. from what I understand, the first driver hay have been harsh on the clutch A.K.A. not know how to start.  this could also be just from wear and tear.  At 137000 miles, everyone has harsh clutch starts occasonally.

Over all, I think this has been a good car, and if you are considering buying, drive on the freeway for a while, and see if your clutch will occasionally change in tightness.  I also would say at above 100k, I would not pay more than 3500 without 4WD and with a 2.3.  Although, I cannot complain, I only paid 500 of 2500, parents CAN be nice occasionally.
