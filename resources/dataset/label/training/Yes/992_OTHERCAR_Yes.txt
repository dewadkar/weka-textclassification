            Being 6'-7" tall and my wife a petite 5'-4" finding a car that fits both is a challenge.  We don't have kids, but we do have big dogs.  Are lifestyle is active and we always have had fun cars.  Camaro's, mustangs, and covertibles.  She has a VW ragtop that we leased.  Living in the north where snow season is 4 months long.  You tend to want a car with front wheel drive or four wheel drive.  When the snow gets bad we drove the VW.  But it has its limits on the snowy hilly roads.  So we went looking for a front wheel drive car.  We looked at the Mini, Mazda 5, civic, acura RSX, Mercedes C230, Now all those cars had one thing in common nobody can sit behind me.  All are front wheel drive and with automatic they are either just under $20K or way over.  Now we even looked at bigger cars like the Mazda 6 and the accord and camary.  With the options we wanted they all were over $20K.  But none of these cars offered all wheel drive.  The matrix has good use of space, great back seat space behind tall drivers, decent handeling for what it is. Plus its has All wheel drive.  We optioned ares out to the maximum.  Sunroof, cargo mats, 4wd, pet guard, CD six speakers with Bass Bazooka.  It came to $21K.  It came to twenty one thousand dollars.  The dealer we tested it at would just give you the keys.  So I have a friend who owns a gravel pit.  Since there wasn't snow, he had plenty of mud, dirt, and hills to try this puppy out on.   We slid it into a nice mudhole and drove out with very little tire spin.  Took a mud/dirt turn at around 25 mph and it was very stable. Also tried to do my best FIA Rally slide and it did that too.  Yes we washed it before returning to dealer.  Sorry for whoever bought that one.  We ordered a set of steel wheels 16" with Dunlop Snow tires for winter.  I can't wait to install them at all four corners and do my best Colin McCrae impersonations in the snowy corners.  Since it was All Wheel Drive we started comparing to other AWD's. The subaru has no backseat room and is a much smaller wagon. Though more power and more pricier.  Its a great little sorta car.  It is not going to be a pocket rocket racer. But if you are a new family with kids and you don't want a minivan it would be a great alternative.  My Mom almost bought a matrix and she bought the PT Cruiser.  Its nice but it has some horrible blind spots and is not large person friendly. Plus the Matrix looks more sportier.  For those people needing more power.  We already ordered up the TRD exhaust which adds 15 horsepower and torque.  Then we also notice they sell a supercharger that adds 60HP and 80 pounds of torgue.  That is power throughout the rpm range.  We also purchase a set of 18x8 chrome wheels with 225/35/18 tires for the summer.  Still with everything we bought it is the same price as a Mazda 6.  So if you see a Yellow Matrix throwing a rooster tail of snow around a corner.  Give me the thumbs up.
