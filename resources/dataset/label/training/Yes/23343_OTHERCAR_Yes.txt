            RX-7's are cool little cars that hold their esteem amongst lovers of the marquee. They are kind of like Ferrari's in the respect that you get a great looking car which draws attention and is a very high performer, but you also get a car that has lots of little quirks that you either learn to accept or you buy another type of car. First off, the RX-7 is an amazing performance machine. Their twin rotary engines are tiny, and the fact that they make 255hp stock is a phenomenal realization. In order to get that hp out of such a small engine they added two turbo's which essentially double the hp that the engine would make without them. These Turbo's are complex and are vacuum line nightmares; one little hole or cracked vacuum line in any of the uncountable lines criss-crossing the engine compartment and you'll notice something wrong with engine performance. Plus, the engines on average are good for about 55,000 miles before they need to be replaced or rebuilt. If it so happens that you own a RX-7 that's engine has made it past that 55-60K mark then it will almost certainly be dead by the 115-120K mark. It seems that if they can make it past the 55-60 barrier than they can last to about the 115-120K miles mark. They are not cheap to work on either, and most mechanics haven't a clue how to work on a Mazda rotary engine. If this hasn't scared you away then maybe a RX-7 isn't a bad choice. Although, avoid the automatic transmissions models. Mazda for some reason used the auto tranny out of the Mazda MVP mini-van for the RX-7. It sucks, and is dangerous. With a automatic you will get beat off the line by a Ford Aspire, the autos have terrible 1st gear acceleration and it takes it awhile for the engine to build up enough speed to spool up the first turbo, which usually kicks in mid corner and throws you for a loop the first time you drive it. The manual trans. cars are awesome, and very fast. These cars stop on a dime, probably have some of the best brakes ever on a car. They handle great at high speeds also, thanks to a speed sensitive power steering unit. The interior dash is laid out perfectly for a sports car, in fact it's what I usually base my opinions of other dashes by. The tach. is huge and the speedo smaller and it's perfectly visible day or night, it's a great design. The cloth bucket seats that came with the R1 package are way better than the the leather ones, unless you like sliding around when driving through hard corners. All in all a fun car and a phenom performer that can be modded to make scary amounts of HP. Just has a few quirks.
