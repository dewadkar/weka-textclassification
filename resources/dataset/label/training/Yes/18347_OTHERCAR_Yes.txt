            I purchased a Casio QV-120 about 3 years ago as my first digital camera, was originally looking at a different model (I think the QV-11 or something), I was on a budget, and had to watch what I spent (was getting married in a few months) we (my wife, though fiance at the time) and I wanted to get one for the honeymoon, to take pics of where we went.. well, we were getting ready for our summer vacation, we decided to get the cam on the way (found a good price at a place we'd be passing) so we got it, and I learned how to use it fast enough.. for the time, it took good pics, very clear, good color, but in a poorly lit room, or at night, the results weren't as good, anyway, we still have that cam (just upgraded to a Fuji 1400Zoom) and it still takes good pics, though not as good as the Fuji.. they still are very useable for web pics and all... I was using it mostly at work for taking pics of things we'd post on an auction site.. which it did well, (the swivel lense helps a LOT there), I been reading the other reviews, and all I can say is, if you compare this cam to what's out now, yes, it is at the low end, however, this is a 3 year old cam, compare it to ones from 3 years ago, it holds up better.. I love being able to keep the cam in either my pants pocket, or jacket pocket, in it's carrying pouch, for quick access (even had it in my pocket the day I got married, no one noticed til I took it out (I don't like having my pic taken, so I started taking pics of people taking my pic, as a joke), my new wife was stunned, and asked where I had it, I told her and she was shocked *smiles*

anyway.. I feel this is still a good cam (esp for a first cam) and the est price of $300.00 is too high (when I got mine 3 years ago it was $200.00) most places I have seen this cam (auction sites) have it for closer to 60-75 dollars) which is fair for a cam like this, I have taken MANY fine pics with this cam, and just about all have come out well.. it's no megapixel monster, but still takes good pics, in the right lighting conditions

also I see people complaining that the batterise don't last long.. I find that's only if you use cheap batteries, I use either Duracell Ultra's or Everready Titanium Batteries, I get a few weeks out of them ,with regular use)
