            I actually bought mine when it was still Agfa's number two camera and at that time is price point for quality was hard to match, much less beat. But these days I am starting to question the camera's useful life. By alot of standards it is still quite an advanced camera, but some things to take into consideration now are the speed at which the images transfer. Also the software that downloads the images is old and bulky. With the onset of USB and Firewire becoming mainstream I would advise a consumer to get a camera that takes advantage of one of those technologies. Mostly for the faster download times. Another unfortunate feature for this camera is the batteries, it uses 4 double A batteries, in normal use this equals about a half hour if you are lucky. I would again advise someone to get a camera with a better battery. All the bad things aside the image quality is great and the bundled software is adiquate. So even if you are a professional and need quick photos for the internet or a newsletter look no further for the price it is at now it would be hard to find a better deal. But I highly recomend getting the AC adapter.<br><br>
