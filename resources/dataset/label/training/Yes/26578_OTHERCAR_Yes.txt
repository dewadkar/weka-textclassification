            <b>Why The 2003 Toyota 4Runner SR5?</b>
This is the year I decided my fairly active outdoor lifestyle waranted going from a small car to a larger, more rugged SUV.  I do quite a bit of rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, and camping.  Top that off with a move from the relatively flat state of Delaware to Arizona, and I wanted a vehicle that would equally be at home on my commute to work, or getting me to that remote trailhead.

I did a lot of SUV test driving before I decided to purchase a 4Runner.  Other vehicles I tried included the Nissan Xterra, Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer, and the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  While each had their strong and weak points, none even came close to the experience I had with the 2003 Toyota 4Runner.

I settled on the SR5 as opposed to the sport or limited mainly because of price.  I got my SR5 with most of the available options.  It would have been nice to have leather seats (they are easier to clean than cloth), but I couldn't justify the difference in price.

<b>The Drive</b>
One thing worth considering on the V8 model of the truck is the fact that Toyota is using the same V8 engine across their lineup.  That means that the Tundra (pickup), 4Runner, Sequioa, and Land Cruiser all use the same proven power plant.  

The first thing I noticed during the test drive (and have come to love since purchasing) is the acceleration.  This truck moves!  The V8 provides exceptional pickup, making things like highway passing a snap.  The overall ride is very smooth. In fact, it had the smoothest ride of all the SUV's I tested.  Road noise was non-existent.  Even with the moonroof open, road-noise is at a minimum.

The V8 comes with a 5 speed automatic transmission (no manual transmission is available).  The gear shift layout took a little getting used to as it moves in a zig-zag patter as opposed to the traditional linear fashion found on most automatics.  The shifting action is smooth, and I found the shift timing to be dead on.  As someone who drove a manual transmission for the past 15 years, I was impressed with how far automatic transmissions have come!

The 4Runner handles well too.  Cornering was acceptable, without any excess roll as I've noticed in other SUVs.  If you really want to reduce roll, check out the Sport and Limited models with the XReas suspension.  The antilock brakes, traction control, and disc brakes all add to the SUV's ability to maneuver well in all situations.  The turning radius is also VERY impressive considering the size of the truck.  For an SUV, this vehicle handles almost like a car while still maintaining the ruggedness of a truck.  

Braking in the truck took a little getting used to for me, especially coming from a light-weight, compact car.  The braking action is smooth and consistent.  However, it's important to note that due to the truck's weight, I find I need to apply the brakes much earlier than I did in my previous car.

I choose a 4x4 model because of my planned off-road and towing use.  The 4X2 model should suffice for those who don't plan on taking their vehicle off-road much, or aren't planning on towing.  Toyota's full-time 4 wheel drive is both convenient (no need to worry about wheel locking or accidentally leaving the vehicle in 4 wheel drive mode when on dry pavement).

The 4x4 model SR5 with the V8 is rated to get 16 to 19 mpg.  I've found that I've averages 18.1 mpg in combined city/highway driving using standard 87 octane gas.  I'm averaging about 350 miles per fill-up (20-21 gallon capacity).

<b>Creature Comforts</b>
The engineers at Toyota did a great job of anticipating what vehicle owners would want and how they would use the vehicle.  Some of the highlights:

  1) Tilt/telescopic steering wheel
  2) Lots of cup and water bottle holders
  3) 2-stage cargo rear cargo platform
  4) Cargo net is very handy
  5) Integrated trailer hitch
  6) Automatic climate control.  The controls take a little getting used to, but once you do, they are convenient.
  7) Running boards make it easier for shorter drivers/passengers to enter and exit the vehicle.
  8) Rear door lifts as a single unit (glass goes down into door) providing easy, full access to rear cargo area.
  9) Rear 60/40 seats are easy to fold down and lie flat, making for a large rear cargo area.

<b>Minor Inconveniences</b>
As with all things, the 2003 Toyota 4Runner is not perfect (although it is close!).  I've got no complaints about the comfort or mechanical performance of the car at all.  I did, however, find a few of the interior cabin designs mildly annoying.  Here's a quick rundown of the things I think the Toyota engineers should rethink for the 2004 model:

  1) Instrument panel - right now, the recessed "tube" like housing for the instrument cluster can make it difficult to see all of the operations clearly when the tilt/telescoping steering wheel is adjusted to various positions.
  2) No headlight alarm - Although the headlights automatically turn off after 30 seconds or so, it would have been nice if Toyota included an audible warning to let you know you left your lights on when the truck is turned off.
  3) If you are like me and often need to charge your cell phone in your vehicle, you might find the placement of the power (lighter style) outlet a little awkward.
  4) The key fob remote control can be used to lower the rear window, but it can't be used to raise it.  You have to raise the window with the control inside the truck, or by inserting the key into the rear door lock.  How hard would it have been to make the remote also raise the window?

<b>Wrapping It Up</b>
All in all, the 2003 Toyota 4Runner is an excellent mid-priced, mid-sized SUV.  The reliability and resale value of the 4Runner are both rated excellent by several publications including Consumer Reports.  So far, I've been nothing but happy with my decision to purchase the 4Runner.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for an SUV that as much at home on and off the road.
