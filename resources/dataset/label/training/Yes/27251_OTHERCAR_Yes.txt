            It was love at first sight.  I think it was the scooped hood and two flaring nostrils of this car that first caught my eye.  Maybe it was the rumble of the V8 5.7 liter 320 HP engine...  It could have been the manual transmission with the short-throw Hurst shifter...  Whatever it was, I am in absolute love with my 2000 Trans Am Ram Air.

There is an indescribable feeling you get when in command of all 320 horses, with the t-tops off and the 10 speaker Monsoon sound system rocking.  People wave, truckers stare, and I get 'nice car' comments everywhere I go.  This car demands attention.  It has the kind of aggressive styling that implies 'get out of my way!' when you come up behind someone in the fast lane.  

I got this car with every option possible, except for the 12 disc CD changer (which I don't miss at all).  The MSRP is $32,000, which includes the Ram Air package (20 extra horse power and a really cool scooped hood), leather seats, 8 way adjustable seats, Hurst shifter, and t-tops, all wrapped in the arrest-me red color. 

There are some things I wish Pontiac would add or change on this car.  First, speed controlled volume.  I can't imagine why they didn't include this in a car with such a loud engine.  Secondly, I miss the lighted vanity mirrors.  Call me a chick, but this is a simple $10 option that would make all of the female gear-heads happy.  Third, the exhaust tips on the dual exhaust are not aesthetically appealing.  In the 1998 and 1999 versions of this car, the exhaust tips were oblong, which matched the rear facia exhaust molds.  My 2000 has dinky round exhaust tips, which just look out of place.  I plan on remedying this situation by purchasing a new exhaust system down the line.

All in all, though, driving this car is pure ecstasy, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.  Anyone who likes attention and is a true gear-head should buy this car before Pontiac discontinues it in the next few model years.  It will be a classic, guaranteed.  <br><br>
