            My wife and I are on on third Subaru and we have no complaints.  We figure that nothing designed or made by humans is perfect, so we appreciate getting our money's worth. And this certainly has been the case with each Subaru we owned.

Our current model is a 1999 Legacy Brighton Wagon. We actually were looking for a used model and found this one at the right time. The dealer was trying to clear the lot for 2000 models and the salesperson was ready to deal, so we bought a new car for a used car price. 

The Brighton is the no-frills basic model. It does not have power windows or or power antenna. Also the engine is a 2.2 liter compared to the 2.5 liter in other models. The tires are also a size smaller, but you'd probably never notice if you didn't compare specs.  Neither the radio nor the AC seems quite as good as our older 1992 Legacy L Wagon, but that's ok, both work well enough.  The thing we both like best is the handling. The car handles great in all road conditions, which in New England is well appreciated. We also like the dashboard, controls, but agree with other Subaru owners about the cup holder.  Meanwhile, Subaru has redesigned it for new models.
 
For what  it's  worth, there are three other family members also own Subaru wagons and all are satisfied with their models.<br><br>
