            Let's get the bad things about this car out of the way first. If you're worried about gas mileage, wet weather driving, or comfort for anybody over 3 feet tall in the back seat, this car isn't for you. That being said, I love this car! I have had my 1993 Firebird Formula for almost five years and I wouldn't trade it for any other car on the road with the possible exception of a ram air bird. I still LOVE the way it looks. The new body style is nice but the '93 just looks a little more intimidating. The 5.7 liter LT-1 will smoke the tires up to 60mph and lay down rubber going into second and third gears every time. The first time I saw one of these I knew I was going to get one someday. The first time I saw mine I knew it was the one. I looked at a couple of the V-6 Birds and almost got one of them but didn't. When the dealer started the car I just fell in love, it just sounds soooo cool! When I took it out for a test drive it was so comfortable and so much fun. When I punched it at 60mph and it dropped back into second gear I knew I was going to make an offer. If you want a car that will turn heads at the stoplight and the blow away the guy in the Mustang sitting next to you, this is it!<br><br>
