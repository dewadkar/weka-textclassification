            Just can't get over the good old American whale - comfy, spacious, and well, I also quite surprised: nimble and quick, no wonder that's the de facto Mobsmobile!

Got it second hand in 1997 for $16,000 out the door,with only 40,000 miles on it. Love it! But like love of any sort, there's a price to pay - repairment of about everything except the running parts. The car runs surprisingly well today, still quiet, and still smooth. I think the Caddies got better smoother transmission. And the Ford V8 is no match to the Norstar. But, this good old 93 towncar is fast, smoothly fast, with style, and nimble too. I replaced four shocks at Midas because the originals just went bad the first few month after I got it. And the car's handling is superb for its size! Now I put on four new wheels, and it's a champ! I drove 98 Mercedes S430, and 1999 BMW 740, and various Caddies. My impression? Town car is the best handling of them all! And I do know a bit about handling because I also owned Acura GSR and Maxima SE with stick, and Honda Magna and CBR600F4 bikes. 

The other problem besides paying for fixing, well, too many to list ( Total about $5000 and now my power windows are not working in the rear and I will leave it! ) is that I tend to fall asleep while driving it for long :) Just too smooth! 

And I got the big whale to 90m/hr easy with the regular unlead drinking 190 hp V8, with average about 20ml/gl. And there's just no match from other cars as far as the trunk space is concerned. But it does require some strength to PULL the heavy items out from the deep trunk though.

Don't know anything about the new models (since 98?) and I hate the look of the new ones. Don't know what to make of them. Too bad now I have to switch if this good old buddy goes down. But sure I won't go for the new Towncar. They should drop the name plate too at Lincohn - because they betrayed the heritage of the towncar! How about LinXes weirdo?
