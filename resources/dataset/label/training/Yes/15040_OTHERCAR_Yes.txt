                   The Sony Mavica Camera offers a WIDE range of digital features which are GREAT for everyone! The pictures you take come out clear, and it's completely light weight and not to big!  It's so easy to use, just stick a floppy disk in, and start shooting pictures, when you get done stick it in your C: drive and look at your pictures. NO DOWNLOADING them and wasting time! It can also hold up to 42 pictures.  Has a GREAT zoom to get up close when you are far away, plus it's so EASY to look at the last picture you took and see if it turned out or if you need to take another! 
      You can set the timer on this so that you can get in the picture too, and you can change the brightness or the lighting conditions! This is PERFECT!  I use it for auctions on e-bay and it's great for web sites and sending photos to family in the &quot;click of a mouse!&quot;  If you can afford it, (cause they are a bit pricey) IT'S WORTH IT!  <br><br>
