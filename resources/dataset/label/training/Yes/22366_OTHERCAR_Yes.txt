            The SC 430 is undoubtedly the finest car that I have ever owned. If you want something with a big trunk, room for 4 adults, manual transmission, long-lasting tires, and a car that causes those driving by you to "yawn"-- then this is not the car for you.

The SC 430 is engineered to be a luxury convertible. Sure you can buy cheaper convertibles but if you want luxury the Lexus is for you. The retractable hardtop is quick up and down (about 16 sec.)and stows in the all ready small trunk leaving just about enough room for a couple of overnight bags. But hey, you want a sports car right? You want a well-made luxury car right?  Then this is the car for you. 

My ONLY complaint is tire wear. My SC came with Dunlop 245/40ZR-18 tires. I had heard that the Dunlops get short milage and now I believe it.  I just replaced them at 12,000 miles.  I purchased a set of Continental ContiExtremeContact for about $885 installed (ouch). I guess that is a small price to pay for having one of the nicest luxury convertibles on the market.

Seats-- finest, supple leather you will find and are very 
        comfortable.
Engine--V8 with 300hp is very quiet and accelerates 
        strongly when needed.
Back seats-- fine for a couple of toddlers-- only.
Stereo--Mark Levinson system. Best I have seen factory
        in any car I have owned. 
Re-sell value--I hear excellent.

I have had Mercedes, 'Vettes, Z-car, and on and on but NO car comes close to this, not even the Mercedes. Attention to detail and fit are supurb and you wont get any yawns by passing motorist-- only gawking. My red SC 430 certainly is an eye-catcher and it is everything I have ever wanted in a vehicle that is a cross between a sports car and a luxury car.

You can buy more expensive convertible sports cars (this model is around $62k sticker) but they will not have the quality that the Lexus has unless you decide on the Mercedes SL500. (I didnt have the $100k for one-- and why?)
