            I love my 1995 Saturn SL2.  It is surprisingly roomy and comfortable.  The trunk is definitely big enough to hold all of the junk that lives in there.  (Stroller, 2 large duffle I use for work, random stuff thrown in there to &quot;clean out&quot; the car and more)  We have had very little problems in the 65,000 miles and 5 years I have had my car.  The Saturn was the first new car I ever owned and since I purchased it for myself is special to me.  I have a stick shift and it drives very smoothly.  It is reliable and if needed, relatively easy to work on.  The SL2 also gets good gas mileage.  As the mother of one, it is the perfect size for now.  I can whip it into tight parking spaces if needed.  Something that is considerably more difficult with our other vehicle.  (A SUV) I would recommend this car to single or married couples with one or no children.  <br><br>
