                 What can more can I say, but, awesome! 
   I purchased a Kia Sportage in 1999, which was my first car. The little-bus as I call it has plenty of room for three persons in the back and a very spacious trunk. Being a college student and an outdoorsman, the Kia has enough compartments and room to provide for all my activities. 

     When I just feel like getting away, I take my Sportage to the river to try out my flyfishing skills. The 4 wheel drive option allows me to get into that unfriendly terrain by the rivers edge.

     There is still my favorite activity I love doing with my Kia Sportage, which is tailgating at sporting events! The easily accessible trunk door elevates to provide the perfect cover for a party. The trunk itself is very unique which allows for two big coolers and plenty of other party items. I speak highly of this aspect of the Sportage because I recently took it to Woodstock 99' which consisted of three days of partying!!!!!!!

    If you have similar interests like me and are looking for an SUV at very affordable price, than look into a Kia Sportage!!!
