            Traded in my Black-on-Black Mustang Convertible, 1997 (sob,sob) when we moved to the mountains.  We needed the 4WD and the space to haul cargo, kids, and &quot;stuff&quot;.  This is strictly a &quot;woman's point of view&quot; nothing at all to do with engine performance, but more of a use point.  The color is metallic grey, great for not showing the road dust on our back roads. The interior is good Honda quality, functional and easy to clean up spills.  It's easy to handle, reliable, and pretty cute, too! Taking it in for our 30,000 first tune up in January, absolutely no problems this first year. We are constantly asked &quot;How do you like that car?&quot;, our answer is always positive. For reliability, ease of use, Honda quality throughout, and a very reasonable price (relatively speaking!) you can't go wrong. Absolutely a great family car.<br><br>
