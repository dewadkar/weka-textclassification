I went to WalMart ready to spend $400+ on the Sony Mavica FD87.  I looked at the display of digital cameras while waiting for the photo department girl to finish helping another customer.  I became intrigued by the fact that the Kodak DX3500 was nearly HALF the price of the Sony, and almost DOUBLE the megapixel quality! The Kodak has 2.2 megapixels, and the Sony has a inferior 1.3.  That made up my mind almost on the spot.  I figured since the good people at WalMart have 90 day return policy, if I hate it, I'll take it back (God bless America).

After little deliberation, I grabbed the camera and the EasyShare Dock (see my review on this product as well!). 

After much fun with my new toy, I am ready to share with the world on the wonders of this camera!  It is VERY easy to use, with a good-sized, colorful lcd screen.  It's menu options are bright, and friendly- and doesn't take much figuring out.  

The camera also came with two Lithium ion batteries that were fully charged to get you started right away. The only thing I didn't like about that is they aren't rechargable.  If you want to charge them, you need NiMh batteries and the dock.

It came with a USB cable and software to upload pictures with or without the dock.  There was a sort of "quick start" guide that told you exactly how to make the dock work with the touch of a button... and it really did just that. You put your camera in it, push the button, and voila! Your photos pop up on your screen.  

It's functions are straight-forward, and not too fancy.  The pictures have been very high quality, and I have been quite pleased.  I've printed 8 x 10 pictures with my Lexmark printer (<a href='/content_52781223556'>http://www.epinions.com/content_52781223556</a> for that review), and have been happy with the outcome.  It advertises enlargement quality up to 8 x 10, and it sure performs. I haven't tested it with smaller prints yet, but I'm sure they'll be even better!

This is an amazing camera for the price, and I highly recommend it for anyone with average to slightly above average photography needs.
