            This past weekend, my younger sister and I spent a day looking for a replacement for the 1988 Buick she currently drives. With her eighteenth birthday fast approaching, she is hoping for a four-wheeled gift, and had her heart set on a Ford Focus ZX3 hatchback. Now, since its introduction, I have found the Focus to be an attractive addition to the Ford lineup, but gave no other thought to it.

After driving the Focus, I can say that it offers a lot more than looks. The dashboard was surprisingly well-designed for an entry level car, featuring top-notch plastics and a natty accent of brushed chrome around the stereo. The seats were comfortable if a bit stiff, and the upholstery seemed above the quality normally expected from cars in this class. 

The automatic transmission shifted very smoothly, and the quiet engine delivered unexpected power. I was also surprised by how quiet the car was...very little road or engine noise intruded into the cabin.

On the downside, the hatchback model offered very little storage space...for a heavy packer like myself, I imagine that even bags for a weekend getaway would have to spill over into the backseat. The car was also overpriced when compared to its competition. I also tried out a two-door Toyota Echo (see my review of it). Interior room in both cars was similar, and for $1,000 less, the Toyota offers known reliability and, if the past is an indicator, better resale value than the Ford.
