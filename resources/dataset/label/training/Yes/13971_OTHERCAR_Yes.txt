            This car really has only one purpose.  It's not to be practical; it's to be fun.  And I can say it is a complete success.  It's great looking (my wife and I endlessly receive compliments about it), it's suprisingly comfortable, it's a joy to drive, it's a convertible,and, best of all, it's priced under $25,000 (for a car that has the looks and nearly the performance of a Boxster).  The downside is that it may well be the most impractical car on the market. There is a tiny amount of cargo space behind the seats (it actually is enough for a weekend trip...if you can fairly light) and a small bit of space in the spare tire compartment, although the owners manual cautions you that this area is not actually waterproof.  So if this is to be your only car, then don't get it.  If you have another vehicle that can handle trips to the grocery store, vacations, etc., then you'll love this car.
