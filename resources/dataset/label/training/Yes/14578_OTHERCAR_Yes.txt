            The Sony Mavica is a fairly decent digital camera. I recommend it for its ease in ergonomics, it is larger, a more normal camera shape, and easier to hold than the Kodak digital camera. Its large screen also is a plus. However, the pictures it produces are a tad grainy and not the highest quality they could be, and not of equal quality to some other digital cameras. i would recommend this camera for families who just want an easy way to store pictures, or for personal web pages, but if you need a professional looking picture, go with another brand.<br><br>
