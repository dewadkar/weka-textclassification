            I bought the 1995 Geo Prizm used, it had about 46K miles on it and was clean as a whistle inside and out. I had had an auto accident that totaled my 1997 Ford Escort and ended up buying the Prizm that differed from the Escort in some ways--namely it was a STANDARD transmission as opposed to my Escort's automatic.  It was also two years older, but it LOOKED so new &amp; modern that you really wouldn't know that it was older

 PROS:  The car is beautiful!  The styling belies it's age, and the reputation of the Prizm is nearly impeccable--many people I spoke with had driven these cars until into the 200,000 mile zone while performing only standard maintenance.  The standard transmission saves on gas--my mileage is always between 32-36 MPG.  The car is roomy enough inside for people to be comfortable on longer trips.  Trunk is enormous!

  CONS:  Strange things are considered optional..like a rear-window defrost, which I miss on icy mornings, and there is no light inside the trunk, so i have missed groceries when unloading in the dark, but if you wish to pay EXTRA for those things, that would eliminate this issue.  Another con would be those who drive in a lot of stop and go traffic would wear out the clutch on the standard transmission.<br><br>
