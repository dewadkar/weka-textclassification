It's full of many options that make driving more comfortable and enjoyable. Some of these options include: a cd player with an exceptional audio system including tweeters in the front, a sun roof(everyone loves 'em), and leather interior with a leather steering wheel. The Accord offers more bang for your buck.
Performance-

VTEC offers offers your engine greater efficiency which basically equates to more power with a smaller engine. Overall, this engine offers about 150 horsepower; not bad at all. You can choose from a 5 speed manual transmission or a 4 speed automatic. Both are great but the 5-speed manual offers a better total driving experience. Since gas mileage is important, the Accord gets 25mpg on the street and 31mpg on the highway. A great stat in an economy with rising gas prices.
