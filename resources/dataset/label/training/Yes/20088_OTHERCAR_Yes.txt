            We bought our 1995 Protege DX in 1997 with 30,000 miles on it.  We were looking at the Corolla and Accord as well but the Protege won out because of its lower cost and similar reliability record (based on Consumer Reports).  My wife and I really enjoy the car for both around town and highway driving.  It now has 88,000 miles on it and have had very few problems with it.  We have just done regular maintenance on it and had to change an EGR valve.  It cruises nicely on the highway and averages about 31 mpg there.  The car always feels solid in handling no matter what the weather.  The trunk has loads of room for a compact car.

On the downside, I wish the Protege had several extra horses under the hood.  The car is underpowered until the RPMs get high.  You can tell a significant power difference when the air conditioner is running.  Also the back seat could use more room especially when a car seat is back there.

Other than that, a great little car for the price.<br><br>
