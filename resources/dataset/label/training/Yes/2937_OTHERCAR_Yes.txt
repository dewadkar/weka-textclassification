            If you're looking for a sporty car that's reliable and keeps its value over time, then the Integra GS-R is definitely for you.  If you just want raw power and performance and are willing to sacrifice reliability and resale, then you probably want to avoid the Acura Integra GS-R.

The Acura Integra GS-R has been the standard by which all other sport coupes have been measured by since its introduction in 1992.  The Integra's combination of performance, reliability, and price have kept it in the lead throughout the years.

There are definitely faster cars out there, but the 8100rpm redline is what makes this car fun to drive.  If you drive the car keeping the tachometer below 6000rpm, then it drives a lot like a sporty Honda Civic.  As soon as you hit 6000rpm it feels like you're driving a different car with a lot more power.  If you're planning on test driving an Integra GS-R, make sure you rev the engine past 6000rpm.  It's the only way you can get a true feel for the car.

The car is very sporty with 170hp and about a 7 second 0-60.  The shifter on the Integra is excellent with sporty short throws between gears and a very natural feel to it.  The clutch is a good balance between gripping performance and softness for smooth shifts.  The car corners very well, due mostly to its light weight.

My only performance complaints are in the tires.  The stock 195/55-15 Michelin XGT's are absolutely terrible tires.  I get a lot squeal from the Michelin's when starting out in 1st gear and sometimes when cornering.  I get this squeal on accident when I'm not pushing the car at all.  If you buy a GS-R, I highly recommend setting aside $600 for a new set of good tires.

One of the main reasons I bought my 2000 Integra GS-R was because of how reliable Hondas and Acuras are.  The Integra is no exception.  The initial quality of my car is great and I've had no problems to date.  The quality of the Integra is probably best reflected in its resale value.  Look online or in the classifieds and you'll see the Integra has a stunning resale value.

The performance, reliability, and practicality you get for just under $23,000 makes the Acura Integra GS-R a tough car to beat.
