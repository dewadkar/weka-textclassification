            I was looking for a digital camera that was easy to use, reasonably priced, and had the ability to transfer a high quality digital image to my Macintosh (USB) computer without any extra accessories.  I found that in the HP PhotoSmart 315 Digital Camera. This camera will also work with USB Pentium Computers that are running Windows 98, ME, NT 4.0, or 2000 Professional. 

This camera has three image quality settings which render the images in JPEG format.  The lowest quality setting produces an image at the 640 X480 pixel resolution, which is ideal for sending as attachments to email, or other internet use.  The two higher image settings produce images at 1200 X 1600 pixel resolution with differing amounts of JPEG compression.

This camera comes with an 8 Mb CompactFlash Memory card.  That is equivalent to a 20 print roll of film when shooting at the fine (medium) resolution (20 pictures).  About 80 pictures can be stored on the card at the lowest resolution, and under 10 at the highest.

I found the Users Guide very understandable and easy to follow.  I was out snapping pictures about ten minutes after it arrived.  It was very simple to use since everything is automatic.  No focusing or setting exposures.  The pictures are excellent.  To me, the colors seem to be more accurately rendered and brighter then those taken with regular film and scanned in to the computer.  To bring the pictures onto your computer you simply plug in the included USB cable and download.  

I would highly recommend this Digital camera to anyone who is looking for an easy to use digital camera that will give you a high quality picture.  To me, HP has been known for their high quality imaging hardware, and this simple camera proves they still are producing that quality in an easy to use package.
