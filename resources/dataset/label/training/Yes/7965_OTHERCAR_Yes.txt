            I remember it like it was yesterday.  It was the summer of 97.
I had just sold my 1974 BMW 2002.  For those of you who don't know what one looks like all I can say was that it was very unique.  I had grown tired of it and I wanted to get a new car.  I'd always wanted a Jeep and went to test drive one.  The one I actually picked was the same one I test drove (I think it was at least).  My first problem was with what I learned afterwards.  I live in Canada and at that time there was a special interest rate offered by Chrysler but guess what, the sales people didn't tell me that.  I got it with something crazy like 10% interest.  I didn't care since I really wanted one.  The Jeep was great but the gas will kill you.  You must be prepared to buy gas every 2-3 days depending on your driving habits.  The warranty is first class.  Anytime I had any problem I would go in and they would fix it right away with no questions asked.  The shift no matter how much you try still gives a little jerk at times even with soft shifting.  The resale is terrible, if your going to get one and you can write off the payments go for a lease to avoid having to get stuck selling it later when you've paid it off.  They're fun.  There are even places you can go to and participate in a Jeep weekend camp full of off-roading fun.

Overall if you ready for a big investment of money then the Jeep's for you.  It's a great looking vehicle and not bad at impressing the ladies either.  If youï¿½re a woman it'll impress the men too!


Later,
