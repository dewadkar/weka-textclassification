            Overview:
�99 Saab 9-5, silver SE with black leather interior, power windows, seats, CD Player, cassette, ventilation fans in front seats -- really!  We seriously looked at BMW�s but found the 3 series too small, the 5 series to expensive and too much �nickle and dime-ing� regarding options like folding rear seats.
  
Rants � just a few minor ones
There was a rattle in a rear head restraint, it took two trips to the dealership to fix it.  A bit more wind noise around the sun roof then I expected � not awful by any means but just a bit more then expected.  Would be nice to be able to turn off the �Shift Up� instrument panel light.
 
Raves � many raves!
Turbo 4 cylinder has been criticized in some of the magazines as being �small� but I find it more than sufficient.  Mountain passes are a piece of cake -- plenty of power with a std transmission.  3rd gear is magic!  Engine compartment is very well laid out and cleanly designed.  Excellent gas mileage, mid 20�s around town and low 30�s on the highway.   The interior of the car is well designed and an easy place to spend a lot of time.  Front seats are very comfortable with have adjustable height, seat angle, back tilt and seat heaters.  Finding a comfortable driving position was easy.  Front seat fans (aka �flatulance extractors�) are very effective at cooling down a sweaty back.  Rear seat heater is on/off for a fixed temperature.  Automatic climate control is excellent with dual (driver vs passengers) interior temperature selection.  Distribution of air between the floor, dash and the defrosters is automatic depending on interior/exterior temperature.  Sun sensor on the dash automatically shifts airflow to the dash and drops the temperature to maintain the dialed in temperature. The AC is actually on all of the time when the temp is above 38 degrees, warm air is mixed in automatically as needed to maintain the interior temperature.  The climate control is smart enough to know that a cold engine will not provide heat to warm a cold car and stays on low until engine heat is up a bit.  The automatic climate control can be overridden though I think I have only needed to do that once.  The dash is real wood and overall well designed.  The AC vent in the glove box (another really!) can be closed -- I have actually used this feature to keep a drink cool though not cold.  The center section of the dash is a bit busy with controls but a major portion of it is related to climate control and can be forgotten about.  There is a button to disable all dash lights but the speedo (0 to 85 lit separately from 85+) to minimize nighttime distractions.  Nice design touch that an instrument, such as the fuel gauge, will light up if its needs attention.  Front in-dash cup holder is an engineering marvel � the one between the front seats is useless.  Rear seat back folds down 60/40 split for sharing the rear seat with long items in the trunk.  Rear seat also has a ski pass through and a fold down tray with two more fold out cup holders.  Many customizable features including 3 seat memories that also remember the outside mirror settings, radio speed sensitive volume and turn-on volume, automatic interior air recirculation in traffic (i.e. slow vehicle speed).  Doors open wide for easy entry and egress. Huge trunk with large opening and without hinges intruding in the trunk.  

Can�t say enough � it�s a wonderful car!
