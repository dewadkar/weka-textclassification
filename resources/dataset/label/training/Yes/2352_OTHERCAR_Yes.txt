            About 4 years ago I bought my Toshiba PDR-M4.  Digital cameras had just started to become mainstream, and a lot of the techno-junkies I knew had bought new digital cameras.  I needed something to take pictures of my stuff for eBay, so I would borrow different people's cameras from time to time.  I kept getting bad, almost useless pictures from most of the cameras I would borrow.  And then someone let me borrow their PDR-M4.  Wow.  I was impressed.  So easy to use.  Such quick viewing and loading.  Such good pictures.  I had to have one.  Awhile later I managed to find a new PDR-M4 on eBay for $360.00.  I have taken over 700 pictures since then and it has worked very well all that time.

STRENGTHS:

The PDR-M4 takes excellent pictures with good, natural lighting.  During my honeymoon, I took pictures of the California coast that were absolutely stunning.  They look as good as postcard photos.  The camera takes pictures very quickly and loads them up into the viewer almost instantly.  The user interface is easy to learn and navigate.  The thumb wheel selector makes this camera so quick and easy to use.  The camera also comes with a good photo editor on CD-ROM, all the cables you should need to hook your camera directly to your computer for downloading, as well as a Flash Path disk in case you need to load the pictures onto a computer through the floppy drive.

WEAKNESSES:

The PDR-M4 generally does not take good photos indoors.  The software provided with the camera does have a "touch up" button that removes a lot of the yellow/orange tint you get with indoor photos, though.  The camera has a "close up" setting, but it doesn't work as well as I would like, as the photos can be fuzzy or grainy.  After a couple years, the thumbwheel broke on my camera.  I was able to repair the camera myself after ordering a replacement part, otherwise a repair by a camera shop would have cost more than the camera was worth.  The 2X zoom is pretty worthless, this is not the camera to use if you need to zoom in on your object.

OVERALL:

When I initially purchased my camera, it was the top of the line of the day.  But, over time, digital camera technology has become cheaper and better.  Compared to newer cameras, the PDR-M4 may still leave the cheap ones in the dust, but the higher end ones probably perform even better.  I have enjoyed using mine and will continue to use it until it eventually wears out.  If you are planning on buying one, I would recommend not spending more than $150.00 for an unused one (they aren't exactly "new") in a box or $80 for a used one.  Either way, make sure your camera includes the following:

-Instructions

-SmartMedia storage card (this is the "film")

-Lithium-Ion battery

-Image Expert for Toshiba by Sierra Imaging (CD-ROM)

-FlashPath Smart Disk*

-USB adapter cord*

-DIN-9 adapter cord*

*if buying used and not all parts are available, make sure you get at least one of these that will work for your computer.
