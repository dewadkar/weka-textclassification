            I've had my MVC-CD1000 for about six weeks now, and despite a couple of quirks, am pleased with it.

I needed a digial camera that would allow me to keep shooting throughout the day. With the limited storage capacity of my old digital camera, I had to stop to download every 21 images. Now I can shoot all day long, maximizing the time spent with models who are on the clock.

Two cautions worth mentioning...

First, the blank mini 8cm CDs are horribly hard to find; at least here in New Hampshire. The store I purchased the camera from, Best Buy, didn't carry the blank CDs. Neither did any of the other electronic stores in the state.

Five CDs come with the camera, and I was getting about 200 - 300 images per CD. However, after burning up the first five, I spent a frantic week trying to locate more. The only ones I eventually located were at www.sony.com, and I had to have them FEDEX'd to me. The two boxes of five disks each were apparently all they had, as when I called back to order more Sony said they were out of stock, and receiving several calls a day from people trying to locate some.

Secondly, don't fill the CD up with images. What the manual doesn't tell you is that &quot;finalizing&quot; the CD for viewing in a puter consumes CD space. If you've filled up the CD there is no space left for the disk to finalize. Since you can't recover space on the CD by deleting images, the only way of viewing and accessing the images on the CD is by hooking it up to your puter and viewing them in the camera via the USB port.

Don't toss your old digital away. You can't just snap a picture or two and use it. You need to &quot;reinitalize&quot; and then &quot;finalize&quot; the CD each time you want to access new images. It can be done, but each time you go through that process it consumes space on the CD. I keep my old digital handy for those needed quick couple of shoots.

I agree, the shutter delay can be a problem, especially for motion shots. It hasn't affected me much, as most of my shots are posed. On occasion, I'll click the shutter only to have the model move during the following 1-second interval of when the photo is actually taken. At least with the screen you can see the picture is messed up and take another.

Despite these shortcomings, it still works well for me. I can shoot all day long without stopping, and the image quality is fine. It has four image capture resolutions, and I've mostly used the second from the bottom, as most my pics are for the web. 

The apperature settings meet my needs as well. My experience has been that digital photography has problems with certain colors such as red. Subjects with lots of red come across much too brightly, almost floresecent in color. I now get suitable exposures by cranking down the apperature.

The batteries last the advertised four hours. However, they will not charge while the camera is on. I'd highly recommend purchasing a second battery if you plan on shooting more than four hours a day. Usually one battery lasts a day of busy shooting, but as the end of the day nears it gets rather close, so being able to pop in a fresh battery is one less thing to worry about.

Check out some of the photographs on my web site. You should be able to see the difference between my old digial camera and the new MVC-CD1000. An example of some of these pics compressed at 10% can be viewed at: http://www.scottssweaters.com/s1.htm

Roam around the site and you should be able to tell the difference between this new digital camera and my old one.
