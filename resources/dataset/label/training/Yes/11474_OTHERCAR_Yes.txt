            When my parents offered to buy my a new car I was set on getting a Honda Civic.  My mother and I passed the Saturn dealership on the way to check out the Civic and decided to stop in.  It was one of the best things I've ever.  There we were, two woman with little knowledge of cars, being given a detailed tour both the inside and outside of the Saturn cars.  Our salesperson spent a lot of time with us, explaining each safety feature in detail and answering all of our questions with direct, no nonsense answers.  At no point did we feel pressured to make a deal.  It was quite a change of pace.  Before we left, we put a deposit down on an SC1.  

Since then my Saturn has driven me back and forth from NYC to Albany for college, gotten my through many of the Albany winters with great handling in the snow and now commutes with me back and forth to work. And the mileage per gallon allowed me to keep a few extra dollars in my pocket for snack food. The service centers allowed me to easily and effortless maintain my car whether I was home for the holiday or away at school. And who wouldn't love the endless invitation to take part in Saturn weekends or other Saturn events.  I would and have recommended this car to a friend and she is now the proud owner of and SL.<br><br>
