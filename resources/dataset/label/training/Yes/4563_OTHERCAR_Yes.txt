            I got this car as a graduation gift from my parents in 1995. When I first saw it, I was less than impressed. It's a very plain looking car with not too many frills. I was fortunate enough to get the automatic moonroof option. Anyway, 8  years and over 150K miles later, the car is running just as well as it was in '95.

Driving Experience:

For a middle of the line compact, the Prizm handles surprisingly well and 'feels' very sturdy, particularly at high speeds and while cornering. I have the 1.8L engine so my Prizm accelerates very well. It also responds very well when it needs to (when swerving out of the way of roadkill and small children and stuff), and is relatively good in the snow. A small problem is driving in very windy conditions (just keep both hands on the steering wheel and you'll be fine). As far as road noise is concerned, the car generates just enough to be slightly annoying (the after-market sound system I installed takes care of that issue though).

Mechanical Issues:

Over the years, I've had the standard problems that one should expect when owning a car (hosed alternator, misfiring spark plugs, flat tires, etc.) Every problem was fixed very easily, quickly, and at a low cost. Very recently (over the past year) however, small things are starting to go. The antennae doesn't work anymore, the rear view mirror broke, the engine light doesn't go off, and just the other day, the ignition mechanism stopped working (I now have to start the car with a screw driver...until I get it fixed). But I guess after 8  years, you have to expect these kinds of things.

All in all, I've been very happy with what I've gotten out of my Prizm. After close to 9 years, I can say that the car was worth every penny. I can still get it going 95 mph and I feel very comfortable driving it to and from work (30 miles each way) every day. Though I expect to be buying a higher end auto in the near future (read: BMW), I would completely recommend purchasing a Prizm. I fully expect the engine to go another 100K miles before it ever breaks down (though you may have to start it with a socket wrench).
