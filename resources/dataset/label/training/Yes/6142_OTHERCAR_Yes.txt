            I just love my 2000 Chevy Impala LS!  I test drove one model and that was it.  I had to get an Impala. They did not have the color or extras I wanted so I ordered one. I ordered it in September 1999 and received it in November 1999.  So far I  have not had any problems with it at all.  I did run over a nail and had a slow leak in one of the tires, but the tire monitor told me I had low tire pressure and warned me before it went flat.  The seats are really comfortable and it has all sorts of room in the back for big passengers.  It has great pick up, so is excellent at passing other vehicles.   I would recommend this car to everyone.  Many types of people could use/like this car, not just people with families as it is being advertised, &quot;As the new family sedan.&quot;  <br><br>
