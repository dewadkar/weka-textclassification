            <b>OVERVIEW</b>

Digital cameras seem to be on almost everybody�s �Gotta have� list these days.  The selection offered in the marketplace tends to become overwhelming, with options ranging from the Polaroid Jam Cam for less than $100 (sometimes offered as a �loss leader� for less than $50) to the Nikon D1 at more than $5000.  Confusing lists of features and conflicting �quality� claims make the search for the �perfect� digital camera a consumer nightmare.  What may be the best overall solution for many users is the Nikon CoolPix 880.  Many photography �Pro�s� are calling Nikon�s newest digital camera the �baby� Coolpix 990, since the 880 offers the same 3.34 megapixel CCD chip as the 990, and many of the features of its bigger brother for three hundred bucks less.

<b>IN THE FIELD/OPERATION & HANDLING</b>

Thanks to a friend who manages a local camera shop I was able to spend some �quality time� with the Nikon Coolpix 880, here are a few of my impressions.  Images from the camera are fantastic, sharp as a tack; the color is bright and well saturated, with a neutral color balance. The camera is compact, with excellent ergonomics, it fits well in the hand (weight is 11.3 ounces), and all the controls are logical and well placed. The camera most resembles a fat upscale �zoom� point �n� shoot.

  The 2.5x optical zoom (35mm equivalent  38-95mm) provides exceptional resolution, and is comparable to the 990�s 3x optical zoom. The 1.5 FPS full resolution image capture (the buffer is almost as good as the one offered on the 990) and 5 area multi point auto focus are great features for accurate composition and capturing action sequences. The fast (f2.8) maximum aperture is very helpful in low light situations, where many digicams fail to measure up.  The 880 also offers macro focus to 1.6 inches, manual focus, and a bright easy to see 1.8 inch TFT LCD monitor.

<b>NEAT FEATURES</b>

Exclusive to the Nikon Coolpix 880 is <b>�Scene Mode�</b> which allows the user to choose from eleven different scenes, the camera then optimizes all settings for the scene chosen.  The scenes available are: <b>Portrait, Party/Indoor, Night Portrait, Night Landscape,  Sunset, Beach/Snow, Fireworks, Close-up, Backlighted, and Copy</b>.  The 880 features an exclusive �CSM� (custom) mode, that allows the user to choose personal settings (exposure mode, flash, focus) and save them, for later retrieval.  Exposure modes are the standard Program, Auto, Aperture Priority, Manual, Exposure Compensation, and Auto Bracketing.

The <b>Quick Play Mode</b> is also unique to the Coolpix 880, when you activate  �quick play� a small window opens in the LCD, and displays the photo you just took. <b>Playback Mode</b> offers all the usual options (Thumbnails, DPOF, Zoom & Scroll, etc) plus you can delete any photo that you don�t like (as opposed to the <i>one or all</i> options offered on many digicams) plus <b>Movie Mode</b> which allows the user to shoot up to forty seconds of �quick time video� 

The Nikon Coolpix 880 menu has more options than the Coolpix 990.  <b>White balance</b> (seven settings) <b>Metering</b> (four settings) <b>Continuous shooting</b> (six settings) <b>Best Shot</b> (takes multiple shots, as long as you hold the shutter button down, the camera will then choose the best exposure) <b>Lens</b> (for using optional wide angle & telephoto adapters) <b>Image adjustment</b> (eight settings) <b>Image Sharpening</b> (five settings) <b>Quality/Size</b> (seven settings) <b>Sensitivity</b> (equivalent to ISO 100, 200, & 400 film) <b>Exposure Options</b> (3 settings)  <b>Focus Options</b> (3 settings)  Plus many other user selected set up options.

Manual Mode allows the user to set both the aperture (either f2.8 or f7.8) and the shutter speed (from 8 seconds to 1/1000th of a second) there is also a �bulb� setting (tripod use is recommended) which keeps the shutter open for up to sixty seconds (as long as the user keeps the shutter button depressed)

<b>SUMMARY</b> 

Does the Nikon Coolpix 880 have a downside?  The  2CR5 lithium batteries will break the bank if you shoot a lot.  A better option is the Nikon EN-EL1 rechargeable battery (optional $45.00) and the charger EH-21 AC (optional $65.00) The included 8MB CompactFlash Card (type 1) is much too small, buying an optional 64MB CompactFlash Card is recommended. 

Overall the Nikon Coolpix 880 is an exceptional value, you get many of the same features that Nikon offers on the more expensive Nikon Coolpix 990 for considerably less.  The 880 offers a couple of neat features that the Nikon Coolpix 990 doesn�t provide like the �scene mode� and "CSM mode� Factor in manual control options, an excellent macro mode, a great playback mode, well designed user friendly controls and menu, and you may have the best over-all balance between features and cost of any digicam currently available in the marketplace.
