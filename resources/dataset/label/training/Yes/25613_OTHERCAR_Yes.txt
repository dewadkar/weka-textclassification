            I've owned 3 bmw's previously so was getting a bit burned out and feeling too yuppified.  The Saab is definitely more understated, yet elegant.  You either hate love it or hate it.  Spent a bit of time in Boston and noticed it seemed to be the car of choice, versus bmw's in CA.  So I went for the lower key style and am very pleased.

4-cylinder turbo is quick, though i wish it had 6. 

Ergonomically not as good as the bmw's.  For example, the electric window levers are a bit off to reach and also it's easy to get mixed up with the sun roof. 

Cup holder locations simply suck.  Radio and CD are good.  A bit of rattling sound on long drives and oversteering to one side gives you a shrieking noise.<br>
