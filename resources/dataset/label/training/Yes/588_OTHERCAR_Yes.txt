            In just over a few years, Lexus has come to be known by many car enthusiasts as the brand for luxury.  The type of engineering, design, R & D and that is invested has been producing great profits.  It goes without saying that Lexus has been marketed to an upwardly mobile, rich and professional group.  Lexus's target customers are the ordinary people who may be working at the same company as you do.  Most of them have worked long hours and saved to become the proud owners of their dream car.  They hope to drive this very exciting, elusive piece of luxury.  As soon as they can, they try to get the most value for the vehicle they were driving.  They trade it in.  Such was the case of a co-worker of mine who ended up trading her Toyota Camry for her new Lexus.  The wife of a dentist, friend of mine, who was not satisfied with her recent Mercedes Benz because of its electrical problems ended up trading it in for her own Lexus.

<b>What differentiates the Lexus RX 300 from any other SUV?</b>
<i>Let's look at some of its key features</i>
Unlike any other SUVs on the market, the Lexus exudes the threshold of comfort and convenience. While it may not be as big as a huge Ford Excursion box, it has all and even more amenities found in those huge SUVs.  The Lexus R300 makes you realize that your body does not have to suffer so much from the poor conditions of the road you are traveling on.  This goes without saying that you can negotiate any difficult terrain, pothole, river without any problems.  With fully independent MacPherson strut suspension and front and rear anti-vibration subframes, the 2002 Lexus RX 300 will provide you with a ride you have never had before.  All you need to concentrate on is your task ahead.  You will be able to take your mind off the journey itself and focus it on what can help you become more productive.  While your eyes may be focused on the roads, your mind will have already engaged you on finding solutions to some of the problems at work.  The moment you spot a Lexus RX 300, you will be attracted by its appealing design.  You know it's all about pleasing your senses and satisfying your most intimate dreams.  Take a look at the chassis and the cabin.  You will find the rich walnut accents, available leather trim, optional power tilt-and-slide moonroof.  The one I was test-driving had all these amenities.  When I sat behind the steering wheel for the first time, I sensed that my head was about to touch the roof top.  All I needed to do was to adjust the seat.  In fact, the sales person who accompanied was rather short.  That was his level of comfort behind the wheel.

<b>What else do you want to know about the Lexus's safety and reliance?</b>

The RX 300 is equipped with the advanced safety systems known as Vehicle Skid Control with Traction Control.  Can you imagine, for an instant, what these safety systems can do for you when you encounter bad road conditions such as snow, rain, and so on?  In addition, the RX 300 was selected as a "Best Pick" in the frontal offset crash test by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.  Now, this is big news.  Just read about the performance of this SUV in Consumer's Reports for example.  

You will like the interior styling.  The leather trim, walnut accents, instrument cluster, upholstery and dash board layout all highlight a high-tech environment.  With easy access to your CD player, you can truly travel in high class.  If you have an affinity for order, organization, you will rest impressed by the the RX 300's modern and coordinated looks and feel.  While it may be compact in comparison with the average SUVs on the roads, it seats 5 passengers without any problems.  It has quite an spacious trunk that allows you to load up your luggage and groceries.  After all, this is a family car.  You can use it for the short trip to the local stores and various other errands in your downtown areas.  

I recommend this SUV to anybody who wants to purchase a luxury vehicle.  If you want to show it off, do it in a Lexus RX 300 this year!
