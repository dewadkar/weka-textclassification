            I bought this product because of the size, the design and the features.
2.1 megapixels are far enough for me, so a resolution of 1600x1200x32bit is great quality. the camera is built in stainless steel.
The compact flash shipped is to small, so I recommend to buy some bigger ones.
I only had good experiences with it. it's small, it makes perfect image. the connection to the pc is perfect, the software shipped with is powerfull.
this cam should be bought by semi-professionals and hobby-photographs that want a small, great looking camera with all features that it needs.
the Shot-button is perfectly made, the zoom selector, too.
over all, a great piece of technic<br><br>
