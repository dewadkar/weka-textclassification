            The ford explorer is a very tricky car. when i first bought it, it was as if it was a dream. it drives like no other, and its very comfortable. but after a few months of driving, it began breaking down. and loosing parts very fast. not only did it stall all the time, and had to change light bulbs, batteries etc. the cost became very great. since i was having to fix it all the time, it got expensive. the parts where also expensive. the car is a very safe car. but you cannot take corners fast, it topples over easily. it is a very top heavy car. it has room. and has a big engine. it handles nice  in the snow. over all i give it a three out of five stars<br><br>
