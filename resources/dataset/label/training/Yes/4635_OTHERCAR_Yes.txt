            OK...I have never admitted it in public, but I love my Cavalier. It is the second one I have owned in the past 10 years, and is a great deal for the price. Considering owning one? Check out the following:

Gas mileage: My current 1996 4-door Cavalier has 80,000 miles on it and I still get excellent gas mileage. I regularly drive to see relatives over 400 miles away and can make it on little more than 3/4 of a tank. My husband, who drives a Toyota Corolla, can't make it on a full tank and has to refuel about 40 miles from our destination. Consider the cost savings in fuel over time versus other models when shopping.

Design: Sure, it's not a luxury car, but the design is much more contemporary than previous years (my last Cavalier was a '91 with a much boxier shape). The sedan (4-door) model affords plenty of room, with a fold-down rear seat for additional trunk space.

Driving: In comparison to other vehicles, I find that my car rides relatively smoothly. With both vehicles, the promised &quot;100,000 miles before a tune-up&quot; has held true. Pick-up (speed) is comparable with other 4-cylinder engines (and faster than the Corolla).

Perhaps the best benefit has been the relative lack of maintenance this car has required. As a female that admittedly knows little about cars, I have found it easy to maintain with few problems.

Some caveats to consider:

-Just like any other vehicle, repairs increase in number and cost as a vehicle ages. With both vehicles (1991 model at 100,000 miles and 1996 model at 70,000 miles) I have had to replace head gaskets and hoses at an expense of approx. $300. At the 130,000 mile mark with the 1991 model, I replaced the flywheel as well (a cost of $400 as the engine has to be taken apart for this repair). 

-Make sure, especially when purchasing a used Cavalier, that the exhaust clamps are not rusted and hold the exhaust system firmly in place. The exhaust system on the 1991 model fell when the clamps snapped and the exhaust on my 1996 model rattles occasionally due to ill-fitting clamps. 

Overall, the Cavalier is a good family car at a decent price. Expect to pay 11-13K new; I paid 6K used for my 1996 model at 50,000 miles and feel I got a good deal. <br><br>
