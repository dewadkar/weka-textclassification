            A few years ago, I had the pleasure of driving a Ferrari 348 tb.  If I recall correctly, the model year was 1993.  I was fortunate to get myself in this machine since one of my best friend's family owns a famous exotic cars dealership in Asia (Ferrari, McLaren, Lotus, and Maserati).  Having this incredible resource, I am always &quot;test driving&quot; something for them every time I have a chance to visit.  The Ferrari 348 tb is definitely one of the most memorable experiences (more exotic car reviews coming up... lol).

Ferraris are known for their beauty, performance, and exclusivity.  This Italian exotic definitely carried the extraordinary family traits.  After stepping into the 348, your urge to drive overwhelms your other senses.  The interior of the 348 is somewhat plain, however tasteful.  The seat hugs your body with a big welcome.  The 3-spoke steering wheel is small but comfortable and functional.  Twist the key to start the ignition, the famous Ferrari engine fulfills your ears' senses with a low rumble and faint chain noises.  Have a moment of silence with the car; you are in car lover's heaven.

Stepping on the HEAVY clutch, shift into 1st gear with the distinctive metallic click from the famous metal shift gates and sphere shift knob, and step on the throttle--now you are cooking.  I admit, the initial acceleration on the 348 is not that exceptional (about 5.5 sec to 60), but this car seems to accelerate faster and smoother as speed climbs.  The 348 really start to kick butt after 60mph, and is a phenomenal performer after 1/4 mile.  The steering feel is extremely direct and the execution for input is pinpoints accurate.  The engine feels like it will never run out of power, full throttle this car even at triple digit speed will push you back into your seat.  I was thinking, &quot;If this is a V8, I can't wait till I drive the V12.&quot;  Send the Ferrari into a turn, the car will obediently accepts your orders.  There is no evident body roll, and there are no hidden surprises.  The harder you drive this car, the better the car performs.  Although forgiving enough, this car is not foolproof, try to bend the laws of physics, you will get a spanking (not the good kind).  As long as you do not make errors, the car goes, stops, and turns like the super car you've built on your video game.  Keep in mind, going recklessly and make errors in this car will result in COSTLY consequences.

Sure that owning and driving a Ferrari would be fun for a car lover.  However, before you max out your 20 credit cards to put the down payment on this beauty or any Ferrari, make sure you can handle the actual ownership.  Ferraris are not good daily drivers.  The ride is not smooth enough, you will need to work out your left leg for a few month to handle the heavy clutch, and last but not least, you have the high maintenance costs.  A Ferrari is built like a racecar and it needs to be taken care of like one.  On your major schedule maintenance, the technician needs to lift out the engine to give it a thorough tuning (about $4,000).  Again, Ferraris are known for beauty, performance, and exclusivity; they are not known for reliability.  Any Ferrari needs meticulous caring by her owner.  If you expect a Ferrari to run trouble free like a Toyota or Honda, you need to look elsewhere.

So, is the car worth it?  If you can afford the maintenance and the sticker price:  &quot;F%&amp;k Yeah!&quot;  Unlike many other sports cars on the market, the Ferrari is a pure bred.  A Ferrari does not try to pretend to be an exotic supercar and a luxury GT at the same time.  No, a Ferrari is not confused with her personality, nor does she try to pull that B.S. on her owner.  No compromise driving, pure high performance and real motoring excitement, that's what a Ferrari is about.
