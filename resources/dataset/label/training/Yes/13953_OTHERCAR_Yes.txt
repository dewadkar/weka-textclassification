            My husband and I purchased our 1998 two door Chevy Metro in the Spring of 1998.  We were tickled pink to get this car being that we were a young married couple on a tight budget.  For the first year our Metro was a hit!  It is never thirsty for gas....We spend about $10.00 a week to drive it EVERYWHERE. It is small and compact, which makes it very easy to keep clean. I am a tall women, 6' feet tall.  My husband is a car salesman and I always have a chance to sample certain cars.  I found out that surprisingly, the Metro has more leg room in the drivers' seat then the Neon. For being a little car, it also has a nice amount of room in the back for my long-legged body.  The Metro overall was a very good decision for my husband and I.  That is, until the baby came.Our little Metro is cheap but, not roomy for a baby carseat! We put the carseat behind the driver side seat. First, I have to actually stand in the car to get the carseat safely fastened in the back seat.  Then, the drivers' seat is no longer comfortable for me to drive because my knees are in the dash. Finally, if going grocery shopping with the baby don't plan on getting a weeks order. There is not very much room left after the &quot;big&quot; carseat is in the &quot;little&quot; car.  But, like I said the Chevy Metro is a cheap,reliable car....just not a good choice for a family larger then two.<br><br>
