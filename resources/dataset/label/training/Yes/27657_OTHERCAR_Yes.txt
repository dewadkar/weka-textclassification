            I bought my accent when they were first introduced in 1995.  I paid a significant amount more for my car than they go for now.  But, that was because the car had just been introduced.  

This car has been through the good and the bad, and yet it has survived.  I have gone for up to 5000 miles without an oil change, and it still runs.  I have driven it with no oil, and it still runs.

I am not proud of the way in which my car was treated, by all means, but I must say...I have never in my life seen a car go through what my car has gone through.  And still run.

If you are looking for an affordable, cute, car I would recommend this car for you.  I especially think it's a good car for young people, maybe in college or just out, who may have to travel quite a bit.  It's affordable and yet you can have a new car, to relieve yourself of the worry of being stuck where you are.<br><br>
