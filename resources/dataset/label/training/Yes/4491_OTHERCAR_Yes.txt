                This is a different type of car. It�s too �cool� to be a minivan (at least that is what my friends say), and doesn�t resemble a car, or even a truck for that matter. 
    First and foremost, this is a more �practical� Mercedes. Does this imply that the famed S500/500S is not practical? In a manner of speaking, yes. The S series, though better in most aspects, doesn�t compete in 3 categories:
1. This is four wheel drive. The S has a little problem in snow that the ML doesn�t
2. Its not too big, and parking in rarely a problem, the same cant be said about Ss, as they are very large and cumbersome to park
3. The MPG, which is better than most SUVs, is much higher than the S, an important property with the rising gas prices.

    A nifty thing about this car is that it is still a Head turner, though not as much as when it first came out. 

Now the negatives:
1. Leg room 
    First thing I think of when ever I get into this car. The driving position is horrible! If you�re a tall individual you will not like the driving position at all. This might just be me, as my BMW 750il is very, very comfortable and now I just can�t get comfortable in many other cars. Definitely a quality that the S has over the ML. Even in the passenger�s seats, I feel cramped. On long trips, I don�t like to sit completely up in my chair, but have to as its more uncomfortable not to, even if the seats are all the way back on their tracks.  
2. The loved Arm Rest�. The second problem
    In most cars, you can rest your elbows on the center console and the inside of the door, thereby allowing you to rest your arms since they are not suspended in air. The arm rest is too low to allow tall people to actively do this. This is not a problem for short trips, but on long trips it becomes an endurance test. 
3. Handling
    The handling is good, as the car is responsive and controlled, but in a different way from Mercedes/BMW sedans. If you get used to one, you will have a tendency to get frustrated with the other. If your not experienced, the problem of under/oversteer becomes evident handling is different than a true car and true truck.
4.The Reliability 
    Since it was still a relatively new type of car when it bought, many of the bugs were not hammered out of it yet. And as a result, the car is not very, very reliable, but still decent. As with all Mercedes, Small problems can cost a lot to fix.

Quick note: This, as many other cars, is not designed for high speed fun. Though at speeds in excess of 90mph there is little body shaking, the car "feels" very unstable, and control, though still good, is hindered by this "feel." Hard turning at these speeds is NOT suggested. This is not a race or GT car, in sport terms the V6 is a baby, as "flooring" the pedal wont push the car that much, when compared to some cars.
