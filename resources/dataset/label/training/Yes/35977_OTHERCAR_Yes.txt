            I have had my 1999 Civic SE for 11 months, so far I have had no problems.  The service is the best that I have seen.  

Unfortunately, the civic is not as peppy as I hoped, but it isn't to bad, I guess you need to buy the Si if you want peppy.  I find it handles very well, in the city and on the highway.  Plus, the seats are comfortable, for a small car.  I have found that I get alot of wind noise from the from door windows, and the dealer will not do anything about it.  Apparently all of the 1999's have the same problem, it is very very annoying.  If I did a lot of highway driving, I would not tolerate it, however, I do most of my driving in the city.

All in all, it is a great car for nearly anyone.
