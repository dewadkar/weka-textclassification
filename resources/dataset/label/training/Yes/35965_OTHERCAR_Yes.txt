            A Honda Civic EX is a great car for those that want reliability, lots of toots and whistles and style for a great price. A Honda Civic EX sedan retails for about 17,500 fully loaded with all kinds of options such as power windows, power moonroof, A/C, CD Player,etc. 

This car has many pro's- great gas mileage, we have had it for almost 2 years and it has not had to be taken to the shop for anything other then oil changes. When you rev this car up you get a good deal of power. 

My complaints are small and may seem unimportant to some people; the plastic components used on the dashboard and door panels seem to be low quality compared to my 2000 VW Jetta (where they seem a lot sturdier). The shifter (on the 5spd) seems cheap. It doesn't shift as smoothly as other cars I have driven. The seats are a tad on the cheap feeling side.

If you compare this car to any other car with similar options you will generally notice a great savings by purchasing the Civic over the other vehicle.

Other important things to keep in mind about Hondas in general:

They generally have 3-4 trim levels depending on the car:
     There is a Honda DX &amp; CX- These are the 2 most basic Hondas you can  get. Depending on the years they will sometimes come without a radio or cassette. They sometimes don't have power steering (on the CX anyways). No A/C, Sunroof, power windows.

     There is a Honda HX- The big pro on this car is that it has exceptionally high gas mileage compared to the others because it uses a special VTEC-E engine set up.
      
     We next move up to the Honda LX. The LX has a great deal of options: A/C, Power Brakes, power steering, Cassette, Tachometer, keyless entry.
    

     The top of the line model is the EX. The EX has all the LX options plus a moonroof and a better engine. It also has a CD player.

Honda has changed models and what is included on each model of the years so this is a very general summary.
