            I can remember all the way back to Sept. 1996 when I saw my first Expedition at the local dealership. The style, the size, and the respect the vehicle got was just amazing. Lets move forward 3 1/2 years later. My family finally purchased an Expedition. It is a XLT 4X4 w/ the towing package (doubt will use that), Comfort and Convenience package, and all the standard equipment. The Expedition is, by far, the &quot;Great American Vehicle.&quot; 

    What I like: The seats are very comfortable (I'm 6'5 so most vehicles are uncomfortable for me). Because the vehicle is 78.4&quot; tall, the driver has a very commanding view of the road. I have always had a problem with the styling the Tahoe and the Suburban suffer from, but the Expedition is pleasant to look at. I would call it &quot;contemporary.&quot; The layout of the dashboard is very logical and does not look busy or cluttered.
 
    What I don't like: I don't have very many complaints about this vehicle because I think it is extraordinary. The complaints I do have are minor, but here they go. When getting off an expressway on to a onramp the driver really has got to slow the speed down or the vehicle will suffer from body roll (Feels a little uncomfortable at times.) The reason for this is the Expedition is a top heavy vehicle, but isn't any true SUV top heavy. Fuel economy needs to really improve. Ford has claimed that in the next five years fuel economy will improve in all their SUV's. I have gotten as low as 12mpg's and as much as 17mpg's. 2wd Expeditions do get better fuel economy. When parking this vehicle I just automatically head to the outer reaches of any parking lot. I don't want some careless person to open the door of their car into mine. Because, the Expedition is a wide vehicle (78.6&quot; wide), I don't have enough space on each side of my truck to feel comfortable parking it in a normal size parking space.
