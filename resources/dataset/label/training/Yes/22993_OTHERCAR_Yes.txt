                 For Christmas 2000, I decided I wanted to get a digital camera.  Since I am not really a serious photographer, I didn't want to spend over $250 on one.  I did extensive research (including Epinions!) and came to the conclusion that the Polaroid PDC 640 was the best pick for me!  Not only was the price terrific, but the little camera packed a bunch of features that few others in its price range do.  I decided to head on over to Wal-Mart where they had it on sale for only  $149 and purchased my very first digital camera.  I got the &quot;Plus&quot; package which included an 8 mb card which allows for TONS of storage.  Depending on the resolution setting you can attain each of the following:

45 images on Super High quality (4 stars)
90 images on High Quality (3 stars)
142 images on Standard Quality (2 stars)
330 images on Low Quality (1 star)

Keep in mind that by &quot;High,&quot; &quot;Low,&quot; etc. quality they mean the size of the picture (resolution in which it prints).  For example, if you want to print out the photo in a large size, it's reccommended that you take the picture in the &quot;High Quality&quot; setting but if you're just planning on using the picture for email, the internet, or anything that's just on-screen, a &quot;Low Quality&quot; setting will do just fine.  The only thing affected by the setting is the size of the picture itself, not the actual quality of the photograph.

So far, all of the pictures I've taken (even in low light and indoors) have turned out marvelous!  It picks up facial features, colors, and textures perfectly.  I highly reccommend anyone who is looking to buy a digital camera to try the Polaroid PDC 640 Plus!  It's price, features, and image quality make it an excellent buy.<br><br>
