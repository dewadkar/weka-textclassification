            In 1995, My husband and I started the search for a new vehicle.  At this time neither one of us had ever owned a new vehicle.  Well after a few months of searching and driving several different vehicles we still had not made a decision or even knew what we wanted.  At around the same time, Volkswagen came out with the commercial on the Jettas.  Both my husband and I are into sporty type cars so we thought we would go and check it out.  Let me just say that I was dead set against ever owning a Volkswagen though, because of the image that it conjured up in my mind.  That being of the Volkswagen bugs that were so popular in the 1970's. 
Anyways, we get to the dealer which is about forty-five minutes away from where we live.  Immediately, I spot a little red 1995 Jetta in the parking lot.  Red, being my favorite color in a car, I decide I just have to drive it.  Well, we get out of the car, tell the salesperson that we would like to take it for a test drive.  I drove it twenty mintutes and fell in love with the car.  I have always owned small cars and this car was just perfect for us at the time we bought it.  Needless to say we bought the Jetta on the spot, with a whole lot of negotiating. 
One of the pros of the vehicle is that it handles very well in all kinds of weather.  For example, when we first bought the vehicle we lived in Laramie, Wyoming where it snows constantly during the winter.  In the two years following buying the Jetta I never had a problem in the snow with it and it is not four-wheel drive nor did I have chains on it.  Another point to consider is that the gas mileage is excellent. I also like the fact that the front is roomy and comfortable for the driver and the passenger.  Alot of compacts are not that way.  
We have only had a few minor problems with the vehicle since we have owned it.  The first problem was that we have a sun roof in the Jetta, and one week after buying it the microchip went out in it.  I believe this was just a fluke though and the dealership we bought it from immediately fixed it.  The other minor problem was that the dash lights going out after three years, because of a short from the cigarette lighter.  That was immediately fixed though also even though the warranty was up.  The major down side to me when we bought it was the it was only under warranty for twenty four months or 24,000 miles.  I do not know if this has changed or not.
And last but not least is the fact that we have two kids now and the Jetta is getting quite cramped for the four of us.  Overall, I would recommend the Jetta for a couple with no kids.  So I think we are off to look for another vehicle, but we will be keeping the Jetta also.<br><br>
