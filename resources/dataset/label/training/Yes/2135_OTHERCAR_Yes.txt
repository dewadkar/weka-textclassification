            In February 2000, my old Mercedes station wagon was finally starting to complain about commuting from New Hampshire to Boston every day, so I decided I needed a car that was safe, good on gas and nicely-priced.  I'm not a huge Japanese car fan, so I decided to start my search at the local VW dealer.  I was so impressed that within an hour of walking in the door, I was signing the paperwork to take possession of my new VW Golf GL.  A few things made up my mind:

Price -- The sticker price was $15,525 but without even trying I got it for $14,900.  There aren't many quality cars for under $20,000 these days, but a new car for less than $15,000? -- you'd be hard pressed to find a *used* car that's such a good value.

Standard Equipment -- air conditioning, power door locks, remote keyless entry (with the coolest transmitter / key you'll ever see!), alarm, good-quality stereo, tinted glass, really neat headlights, heated power mirrors, full size spare tire, folding rear seats (which give it almost minivan-sized hauling abilities) and more.

Gas Mileage -- I always got 400 miles on $20 of gas.  That's like 32 mpg.

Safety -- driver and passenger front and side airbags, anti-lock brakes, etc.  I was hit pretty good by a stoned teenager one morning.  Slammed right into the side of the car.  He did about $4,000 in damage to the car, but no damage to me.

Driving Pleasure -- This car drives better than some cars costing twice it's price.  It's got excellent road manners and is exceptionally tight without feeling like you're riding really hard.  The engine is pretty weak (2.0L 4 cylinder engine -- 0-60 in about 10 seconds) but I'll compromise for the sake of excellent gas consumption.

Miscellaneous -- Free scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance for 2 years or 24,000 miles.  12 year unlimited mileage warranty on rust and corrosion.  If you live in the Northeast, that's pretty important.

What didn't I like?  Two things.  First, they've got to get rid of the awful pattern on the cloth GL seats.  I mean, really.  It's pretty bad.  It's definitely not as bad as some of the early-90s Golfs with the neon graffiti, but gimme plain-Jane not this weird stuff.  Second, they've gotta come up with a better bumper-to-bumper warranty.  I mean, I put 28,000 miles on the car in 9 months and my bumper to bumper warranty was gone.  2/24?  Come on, that's lame.  The 10/100 powertrain warranty is nice but as I later found out, if you sell the car, the new buyer has that warranty cut to 5/50.  Lame, lame, lame.  When you've got Hyundai offering 10/100 bumper to bumper on their cars, it's gotta make you wonder.

In addition, I kinda wish I had gone for the GLS model for a few reasons, all personal.  Manual windows + toll booths = nuisance.  No arm rest on long trips gets old.  I wish I had a sunroof.

One interesting thing that is quite telling about the car:  I've had three friends drive my car who have within a year purchased a new-style VW based on loving mine.  One bought a new 2000 GTI, one bought a new 2000 Jetta GLS VR6 and one bought a used 1999 Jetta GL.

All in all, an absolutely fabulous car.  I defy you to find a better value.
