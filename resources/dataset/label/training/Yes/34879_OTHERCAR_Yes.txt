            After our 1985 Volvo with 260,000 miles went down in flames, we knew it was time to buy a minivan (although we swore, before marrying, that we NEVER would).  With 2 kids and one on the way, it's the only way to go.  I am a big fan of Honda's and Toyotas, and just knew this was the one I wanted .  I felt the Toyota was too small and wanted the roominess of the Honda.  I was fortunate to have taken a test drive when the 99's first came out because now it's not even an option.  The magic seat is a godsend...have it down when travelling and the car is packed.  Put it up when you get there to get all the relatives in the car.

My only &quot;beef&quot; is with the color.  We ordered the Granite Green and I have yet to see any green.  It and the Gray are too much alike.  You can't even see the difference on the road. I really wish I had gotten the dark green.  Even if you can see the dirt more!

I love this car and am can now tow my 3 kids in it with sense of security.  We also got excellent service from our dealer.  I highly recommend it.  You can't compete with the reliability of the Honda name either.  That makes a big difference in my book.<br><br>
