            The 1998 Chevy Cavalier is a small, very dependable, and very affordable car.  I bought mine brand-spanking new for a little over $13,000 including lots of options.  For the stripped down version (minimal options, or no options) it's around $11,000.  Now that two more model years have gone by, the '98 Cavalier is even less expensive, and still as reliable as the day it was made.

<b>The Good:</b>

Antilock Brake System:  I can't tell you how many times this little feature has save me.  Where I live, we get unusual amounts of snow/ice on the roads at certain times of the year, and it's helped me out more than a few times.

Driver &amp; Passenger Airbags:  Haven't had to use these yet (knock, knock) but just knowing that they are there gives me a little more peace of mind.

Daytime Running Lamps:  The DRLs are a great safety feature, and some insurance companies give you discounts if they're on your vehicle.

Cruise Control:  Set this baby, and kick your feet out however you want.(just keep one close to the brake, though)  This feature is a real &quot;leg-saver&quot;.

Power Door Locks:  I LOVE THIS!  Instead of having to reach over the passenger seat to unlock the door for them, just push a button!

Cupholders:  THREE!  Two for the front seat, and one for the back.

Stereo:  My Cavalier has the factory stereo in it.  There's three levels of audio pleasure to choose from.  AM/FM Tape Deck, AM/FM Tape Deck (premium), and AM/FM CD Player.  

Fold-down Seat:  This gives your trunk even MORE storage space.  Did you buy something that's a little too long to go in the trunk?  Fold down the back seat and all your prayers have been answered!


<b>The Bad:</b>
�In 1998, the cavalier coupe didn't have an option for power windows.
�The cupholders are a little shallow, and some taller drinks have a tendancy to tilt.

There you go, I hope this has helped in your decision on buying a '98 Chevy Cavalier or helped you to decide more on what you want out of a car.<br><br>
