            I have owned my Oldsmobile Bravada since September of 1998.  The area in which I live requires a 4WD vehicle to &quot;get around&quot; in the Winter months. 

The &quot;Smart Track&quot; system that the Bravada uses is second to none.  I am very appreciative that I do not have to push any buttons when I feel that I need my 4WD as it senses it automatically.  

I have taken this vehicle in 10&quot; of snow as well as 3&quot; of packed snow and ice and have never had a problem.  More recently, I had to drive in a white-out condition in which I had no problems, except for the need for a slower vehicle.

Further, the Bravada is wonderfully comfortable with its electric lumbar adjustments incorporated into the seats.  

The only problem I have had with this vehicle is that the passenger side electric window button &quot;fell into&quot; the door panel, but that problem was fixed quickly. 

The only complaint I have with this vehicle is its gas mileage.  The gas mileage isn't too terribly bad, but I have had better.
 
I would recommend this vehicle for anyone that needs a reliable SUV at a very good price.
