                  Wow! that was my first reaction when i grabbed the keys and jumped into a new 2000 infiniti qx4 around a year ago. This car is great, it has almost everything i could ever want in a suv. The car was roomy, covered with leather, and walnut trim, every corner was crafted exquisitly. i've drivin toyota 4runners, land cruisers, land rover discovery, and even a pathfinder, all of which are great vehicles, but something was just mission from all of them. I think they are all great and still do but the infiniti was just all that and more. The land rover, was well a land rover, it was a great outdoor car, but just not a commuter. The land cruiser was one of a kind but felt too heavy and sluggish, it also swollowed gas as if it was water. I loved the 4runner though, in many ways it met the qx4 in every way, but the infiniti just had that touch of class to it, the 4runner seemed to have more room, but i found that i could still manage with the qx4's space. 
      I thought the qx4 was very similar to the pathfinder but to my surprise there are many changes, the pathfinder's back seat is very uncomfortable and has just eneough leg room to get in. The qx4 is not much better but seems to have a bit more room and according to friends, feel much better then the pathfinder. The 4 wheel drive system is also different, in all the other suv's i've been in it has a manual shifter thing, in the infiniti there is a switch like the a/c switch, and the car automatically changes for you. This can be annoying at times, it's a little slow on changing but works pretty well.
     Some quriks i have about this car it that on 2wd it feels underpowered and on mountain roads such as hwy 17 and 1 (to santa cruz) it's impossible. This car needs more power. On 4wd this car is superb, it does everything i need it too, accelerated on demand with no lag, and gives you that confidence that you're king of the road again, but it wastes so much gas on this setting, that i don't think it's worth it since gas is so expensive here in the bay area. 
    Other then that and some minor peeves this suv is great, once again it has everything i can think of, and will be problem free for a long time to come. I heard the 2001 qx4 is even better, with a new body, lights, and the analog clock. Well i hope i've helped you out, good luck!
