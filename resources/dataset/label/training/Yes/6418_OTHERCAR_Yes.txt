            I have owned a lot of different makes and models of vehicles and I can say with great confidence that the 97 T100 is one of the best engineered trucks produced during that year.  I drive this truck 100  miles per day and have never been let down.  Currently with 146k miles, it runs like the day I bought it and shows no sign of slowing down.

The center portion of the dash is odd.  The cup holder is above the AC controls and radio.  I often find myself removing coffee drips from that area and have a hard time accessing the vent controls with the cup holder extended.  For some reason, Toyota did not put a clear coat paint on the truck.  Mine is red and I live in Florida, so that is a double whammy for paint fade.  I find Zymol is the absolute best and easiest wax to take care of this problem.

The 3.4l V6 is plenty powerful although nothing to brag about acceleration-wise.  It does have plenty of torque for towing reasonable loads, which I have done a lot of.  

There is no comparison between the T100 and any conceivable competitors like an S-10, Dakota, etc.  I have full confidence that I will be driving this truck for at least 200k with none of the "routine" crud you would have to replace on a Chevy, Dodge or Ford.  God Bless America, but drive a Toyota.
