            Have you ever wanted a car that had style, power, and also looked great. Well the new Cadillac Escalade has it all. It has the style of a Mercedes ML 320, or a Lexus, and the power of a Lincoln Navigator, or A Ford Expedition. This car is fairly large, but no bigger than a suburban or a Ford Excursion. This car actually looks much like a suburban. You don't see many of these cars on the road today. I would say because they are so high priced. You can find them for somewhere around 45,000 dollars, but believe me they are well worth your money. Also if you have kids, there is no need to worry. This car is big enough to hold at least 6 kids comfortably. No matter how big this car really is it still drives and handles like a car the size of a Porsche. Excellent Buy.

Overall this car has everything you could ever want. If you have a lot of money to spend this is a good buy. If not maybe go for a smaller car like a Honda SUV instead.<br><br>
