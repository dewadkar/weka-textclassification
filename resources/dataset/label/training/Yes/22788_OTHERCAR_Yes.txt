            I have owned my 1999 Accent for about the past six months and I have been extremely pleased with it.  In the 20,000 plus miles I have put on it so far it has required no maintenance except for the usual 3,000-mile oil changes.  It has also been getting great gas mileage on the highway as well as the city.  The 1.5L 4-cylinder engine produces a good amount of bang for the buck as well.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a dependable car at a great cost.  <br><br>
