            This is my third attempt at writing this epinion.  The last two times I have tried to write it, my browser has had internal errors and I have lost the reviews.  I am getting very frustrated with my browser and that epinion of Microsoft Internet Explorer is coming soon.  As for now let�s try this one again�

My parents have owned a 2000 Chevrolet Impala for about 6 months, and I think that now it is safe to say that I have fallen in love with yet another Chevrolet automobile.  It�s amazing what these people can do.  This car is selling off the lots faster than the car dealerships can get them onto the lots.  The reason for this is because the Chevrolet Impala appeals to all age groups.  For the new drivers, the 16 year-old teenagers, this car appeals sporty and fast but not too aggressive where the insurance will be sky high.  For the experienced drivers, the adults or even the elderly, this car appears as a luxurious grocery-getter.  If they need something to travel to work in or even take family vacations in, then this is the car for all of them.

<b>Good</b>:

When purchasing this car there are two engine choices to choose from.  The base model is the 3.4-liter V6 that produces 180 horses of power.  This engine is all right but I would recommend going with the bigger LS 3.8-liter V6 engine that produces 200 ponies.  The 3.4-liter will travel 0-60 MPH in about 9 seconds while the 3.8-liter will run it in just about 8 seconds.  Quarter mile times are 17 seconds and 16 seconds respectively.  The 3.8 liter is obviously a much better choice because, of course, it�s much quicker and there are loads of options that come with this engine choice that you have to pay for when purchasing the base model engine.  

Some options that come with the bigger engine are a sporty suspension that handles curves and bumps with ease.  Speed bumps are no problem for this suspension no matter how big they are.  The car also comes with traction control.  This option detects slipping in the rear wheels and locks them whenever it is detected.  It keeps the tires new and also is a great safety feature when you�re traveling in rain or snow.  Speaking of tires, another option is high performance tires on 5 spoke alloy (very sporty) wheels.  This comes with a very handy tire inflation monitor meter as well as anti lock brakes.  

The exterior styling of this car is perfect.  The rounded edges make the car perfectly crafted.  To me it looks like a look into the future, and what cars will start to look like as we travel into this new millenium.  The rear of the car features four round brakes that add to the stylish look.  They are very bright as well and are great for putting the car into reverse at night.  You can see everything behind you just like you can in the front of the car with the front headlights.  A sportier look can be achieved by adding a spoiler to the rear of the car.  This might also keep the car aerodynamically glued to the ground for with all that power I have fear that it might take flight without one.  The front of this car looks very aggressive�it�s almost as aggressive as the muscle cars of Chevy, the Chevrolet Camaro and the Chevrolet Corvette.  This mostly appeals to teenage boys, like me, who want a mean look.

The interior is very stylish as well.  The front and rear seats are very comfortable and are suitable for long road trips.  The front seats give you the sensation that you�re sitting in a cockpit.  They tend to take shape around you from my point of view.  Chevrolet designed the interior perfectly by putting everything within perfect arm�s length reach.  The MPH gauges as well as the fuel and oil gauges are within perfect eye view even with the tilt wheel steering wheel in any position.  The radio and air conditioner controls are also within arms length reach so that you never have to take your eyes off of the road while driving.  Another thing that�s very nice in this car is the automatic gearshift.  It seems to be angled toward the driver and has finger notches that fit perfectly around your hand for perfect shifting ability.  Sifting could not feel any better in this car.

The Chevrolet Impala also has a great amount of legroom, both in the front and the back.  There is room for three people to sit in the back seat and two up front.  Although I have crammed 8 people into this car without complaints I would only recommend four to sit comfortably in this vehicle.  The trunk is also huge.  I have fit up to 4 people into it at one time�as you can see I have been to several drive through movies.  But seriously, there is room for tons of groceries along with tools and other objects.  If you tend to carry long objects such as skis or plywood, then the back seat folds down for extra room.


<b>Bad:</b>  

I have found very few cons when driving this vehicle around.  The few that there are can be fixed though, with a few touchups and a little amount of money.  First of all let me start where I do in the <i>Bad</i> section of most of my car epinions, the radio.  It flat out stinks.  Although the deck itself is strategically located within arm length, the buttons on the deck itself are very unorganized and in no pattern whatsoever.  The speakers are also horrible and I can hardly pick up any radio stations in any town.  I attribute this to a poor antenna for Chevy makes a very poor one at that.

The storage space is also very limited.  With the exception of the trunk there is one middle compartment and the glove box and that is all the storage space.  There is hardly enough room to store CD�s, cell phones, pencils, pens, notepads, maps, or any other tools that are good to keep in a car in case of emergencies.  There are also only two cupholders that hold only small glasses and cups.  The ones that you buy at your local convenience store will not fit without having to be crammed and forced in.  After this beating, when removing the cup, the rubber interior of the cupholder comes out and has to be glued back in.  It�s a real nightmare over something small like cupholders. 

The brakes on this car are also very poor.  For such a light car, this vehicle takes forever to stop.  When I buy a car I want brakes that stop me in a few seconds for fear of safety, and I�m sure that you do too, so when test driving this car give them a good stop and see if they�ll be good enough for you in case of an accident.

The brand new Chevrolet Impala has few flaws and is full of good points that should make anyone want to own one.  I suggest you go out and test drive yours today for I guarantee that you�ll be pleased and you might even want to get rid of your old car and get into a brand new Impala today.  For a great price of around $20,000 I think that for all the options this car has, that it is very affordable too.  Thanks for reading!
