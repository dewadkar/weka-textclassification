            I have to say, I have always been a jeep fan...that is until I drove the 2000 Pathfinder.  Smooth, quiet and very comfortable.  

You owe it to yourself to drive one before buying a Grand Cherokee...you'll never look back.  It is solid feeling and hasn't got a rattle or squeak anywhere.  The only drawback is Nissan dealers in the Mass area are very unhelpful.  They are hard to deal with.  Bought this one at Bancroft in Worcester, MA.  Best price, great service department, terrible knowledge of the product with lots of &quot;run around&quot; in the sales area.

Get past the experience, however and you'll find a car which I find terribly fun to drive.  The Bose Audio system sounds nice too.  Could use a sub, but otherwise pretty sweet.

Favorite Feature:  The back seats recline!  Sounds like a simple feature, but SUV's can be pretty uncomfortable back there.  This one is comfortable even for long hauls<br><br>
