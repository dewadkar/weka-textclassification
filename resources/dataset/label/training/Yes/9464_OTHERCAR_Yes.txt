            The Dodge Ram is the best truck I have ever seen.  It is the most durable, dependable, and stylish.  Unlike the Ford trucks the front of it is not just a plain old rectangle.  The Dodge Ram has some dimension the the front of it which adds extra style.  This truck is amazing.  The truck I have has to go into and out of NYC 5 days a week and it usually has to go places other than the city for delivieries.  If you want a dependable, durable, stylish, and smooth driving truck then I would go for this.  It has 4 wheel drive and you can get an extended cab.  If it was my chose this would be the only truck out there but for now lets just say it SHOULD be the only truck out there.  
I give it 10 stars **********<br><br>
