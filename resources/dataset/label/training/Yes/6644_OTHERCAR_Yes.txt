            For several years I had owned only used cars, mostly Hondas.  Then one day I saw a brand-spankin' new silver Jetta on the street and knew I had to have one for my very own.  The new design was much more refined, and the Jetta had exactly the look I was searching for.  I was in love and soon bought a brand-new 2001 VW Jetta GLS. After considerable time spent negotiating a fair deal at the dealership, I walked out with my sparkling new "baby."  Almost 2 years later I am still absolutely thrilled to own my silver-arrow exterior with black interior, fully-loaded Jetta. So far the Jetta has fulfilled all my expectations and then some. It is peppy and very fun to drive. The front seats are exceptionally comfortable.  Most of the options you have to pay extra for on other cars come almost all standard on the Jetta, including side-impact air bags and a great security system.  My favorite feature is the electric blue and red nighttime dashboard display. It is like a mini disco! I opted for alloy wheels, sunroof, and Monsoon stereo system. My only wish is that I had invested a little extra for the leather interior.  The black velour interior is nearly impossible to keep clean.  It collects every single piece of lint that must removed VERY REGULARLY by vacuuming, using a lint brush, and DUCT TAPE.  Even then it doesn't take much for the interior to start looking sloppy again quickly.  Who should buy this car?  Anybody who wants one!  The Jetta can be appealing to young and old alike, although I have tended to see mostly younger females like myself driving them.  But, my grandparents think my car is wonderful, too, and loved being escorted around town in my lovely Jetta.
