              My name is John and I am a Suzukiphile... Yes, I guess I expect my favorite motorcycle manufacturer to make the same quality cars as they do motorcycles. After all, Honda does it. The Esteem, the Civic's competitor, the unsung champion of mileage, quality, and performance...I am a bit disappointed. As I mentioned before, I get to drive a lot of cars in my job, mainly Tauruses, Camrys, and Accords, and I jumped at the chance to grab the Esteem for a couple of days. First off, styling. The style is far from unique but better than the Sentra, Corolla/Prism (same car)or Mirage. Attractive grill styling, long hood, short trunk and that chrome "S" in the center says sporty and stylish. Second, room. The front seats are quite good and the pedal placement is better than the Saturn S series (those pedals are too close together for a size 12 1/2 foot).Rear seating is suitable for short trips or for children. Switch gear is typical Suzuki and slightly less than solid but reliable and well placed. I like the stereo placement above the climate controls. Whether in the southwest (HOT, need A/C) or when I was in college in Wisconsin (COLD, need heat) I adjusted the stereo far more than the climate control. Either place was a set it and forget it arrangement and I tend to channel or CD surf. Power? Simply not enough. I understand that the 2001 Esteem has a more powerful DOHC 1.8l to make it competitive but the 98, although 200cc's greater than it's Honda competitor, is seriously lacking. By comparison, my 92 Swift GT felt like a real sports car rather than a Metro with enough engine to compete with a 10 year old CRX si.
  
   Now the subjective part: Suzuki can compete with Honda. I am dissappointed in this car because they don't seem to be trying. Honda does not market a CBR750. Why? Because Suzuki seems to own that class. Suzuki makes the world's quickest and quite nearly fastest production vehicle. The Hayabusa.(I said QUITE nearly Lamborghini and McLaren fans...besides, we're talking MASS produced. It will take the Lambo 10 miles of open freeway to catch the 'Busa) Why has Honda not responded and upped the ante on their own Blackbird? Because Suzuki will compete. The Suzuki GSX-R600 makes 100.5 hp, at the rear wheel on the dyno. The Honda CBR600F4i makes 95.5.(I don't think Honda will give up on this one) Suzuki has the technical prowess to make a world class sport compact. They just haven't applied it. Until then the Civic will rule. The 2001 is supposed to be better. Maybe I'll go see.... Until then it appears that Suzuki is going the way of Isuzu, abandoning all car production in favor of SUVs. It's a shame too. Suzuki still makes a wagon that outperforms, on road, the CRV. For those of you secure enough in your man(orwoman)hood enough to drive a wagon and never go off-road, this would be a good choice.
