Pontiacs target clientele is those with a touch of &quot;flair&quot; &amp; &quot;charisma&quot;... much like this car. The 1998 Firebird that I drive daily is far and away the best car I've ever owned. It gives you the &quot;feel&quot; of being in control, with it's Performance Handling Package and sleek, attention grabbing design. One of the major selling points is that 1998 was the first year of the current body-style, meaning it' will look &quot;new&quot; longer than a car that comes from the tail end of a body-style period. Mine still turns heads and gets comments... two years later!

The cars handling and suspension is dynamic, and even the 6 cylinder engine and 5-speed manual transmission gives you a feeling of incredible power at your disposal.

The removable t-tops and Pontiac Monsoon sound system gives the car an all-around comfort and makes it a total pleasure to drive and own.

In my years, I've owned many cars and driven many more. This 1998 Pontiac Firebird is far and away my favorite. Drive one for yourself... but bring the title for your trade because you WILL NOT want to drive your car back home!

<b><i>We've just passed the one year ownership mark. The car had 15,000 miles when we bought it; it's just past 36,000 (past the Manufacturer's Warranty) and thus far the only problems the car has had: A window motor needed replaced and the car started running rough; turned out there was a recall for bad spark plug wires! (We didn't know because we didn't buy the car new and got it used from the &quot;Jeep&quot; dealer I used to work for...)

The '98 Firebird is STILL pleasing in appearance and style and a whole lotta fun to drive. I'm taking off in it for Ft. Lauderdale in just a couple of hours to see Ringo Starr's All Starr Band... okay, actually I'M going to see Eric Carmen... Ringo just happens to be there too. :-) I'll be writing a review of the concert in the Eric Carmen section; or in the Concert section if they have one.

Sorry for the digression... my point was that I STILL get excited about taking a road trip in this car! I mean, it's summer time and there's nothing like driving with the tops off and the Monsoon Sound System blasting out your favorite music! Fortunately we're in a drought and I won't have to worry about rain!</i></b><br><br>
