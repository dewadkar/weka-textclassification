            Toyota designed this car to be flexible to the drivers wants and needs (with some extra money, that is). With available ground effects, 17&quot; wheels, sport suspension (which lowers the car a full 1.2 inches) and vastly improves the handling but sacrifices the smooth ride. TRD is also releasing a supercharger that is rumored to boost the car to 250+ hp and 270+ lbs/ft of torque!! TRD shows off their Solara at many big car shows and as the pace car at some races. It is sooo sweet!

The main reason I bought this car was because it had a 200 hp V6 with a five speed manual transmission. No other 'quality' car in its price range can claim that. I never learned to drive an automatic and find them annoying at best.

My car rolled 12,000 miles on the way home from work tonight and I have not had a single mechanical/functional problem with it yet.
