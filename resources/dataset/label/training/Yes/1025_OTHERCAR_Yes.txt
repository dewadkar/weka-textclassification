            I must first admit that I am in no way ~ shape ~ or form a person who likes Dodges... NOWAY!!!  I've seen far to much and know a little bit about Dodges to ever be persuaded to want to own one.  

But I will say this, I have spent a day driving a 1998 Dodge Intrepid.  And I must say, that the car actually is a very nice car...  I am not going to speak about the mechanics of it, because I am no mechanic, that's for sure, but give it a few years I'm sure it will prove itself to be the "Dodge" that it is...  It's still a little new to start having the typical problems that the majority of dodges I've seen and heard of have.  

The car is very sporty looking, even for a 4 door, and the trunk space is amazingly large... That's a great feature that's for sure.  It's a very roomy car and comfortable to drive and ride in.  The car handles excellent, and is quite powerful, but then again any V6 car would be powerful I guess, so I can't just say that about this particular car.

It takes a little getting used to in order to judge exactly where the front end of this car is when you are parking, but I'm sure if I actually owned the car or drove it everyday it wouldn't be a problem... The Dodge Intrepid has all kinds of neat little gadgets and gizmo's in it... I actually enjoyed driving it.... <i>ohhh nooooo did I just say that???</i>

The car was bought used, and had only one owner, other than a few little dings that you can see at just the right angle, the car appears to be like new, (Inside and out) my boss just got the car about 3 weeks ago, and had only paid $10,500 for it.. With only 45,000 miles on it, I would say she got a good deal.  But I still don't like dodge products... Sorry!!!  :)
