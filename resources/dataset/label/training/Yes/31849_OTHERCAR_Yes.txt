            Dodge Dakota, 1994 Sport 4wd automatic, Aluminum Wheels. BF Goodrich 278's  I bought this power house used in a private sale. I was never so impressed with a vehicle than I was with this one. With the Magnum V6 engine, This baby has loads of power for towing.  At the time I owned a 25 foot power boat on a twin axle trailer. Now this is a lot of weight for a 6 cyl to be towing around, but I had not complaints from the engine. I of course had problems with gas mileage when towing something this heavy but hey, anyone would ( see my other review of the Full size 2500 with the Cummins diesel engine) . The mileage with good for the truck of it's class about 20mpg.
Being the sport the suspension was a stiff, little better than stock.  It truly rode like a car on the highway. Made many trips form Maine to New York with it and never had any problems to speak of. One of the only problems I expernced with the truck was the transaxle. I chattered and clunked when I started up. Had it looked at on several occasions but the shop could never find a problem. It never presented a severe problem to general operation. 
In the snow it was a dream for a 4 WD vehicle. The BFGoodrich tires lent to that better quality.  Never got stuck no matter how hard I tried.
All in all the Dakota was a good vehicle for a fair price and had loads of power to spare.
Always sorry I got rid of it.
