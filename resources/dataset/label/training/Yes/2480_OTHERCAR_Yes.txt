            Hyundai cars are like Frankenstein. It seems that Hyundai engineers take apart five or six of their competitors' cars, replicate the best parts of each, and cobble the pieces into a new car. In the case of the Elantra, the front is like a Nissan Sentra, the midsection looks like a Honda Civic, and the back resembles a Chevy Cavalier. The engine feels like that of a Mitsubishi Mirage, and the interior looks like a Toyota Tercel.
I think this is a good thing. It's like getting the best of everything. My own 1995 Elantra is more blocky than the current model, but it has served us flawlessly. The few problems it has had have been minor, and for the most part, were the fault of either the dealership or me.
It once failed to start due to a malfunction in the dealer-installed alarm, and about a year later, wouldn't start because the negative battery cable had burned up. I am suspicious that this was a result of the dealer's error in installing the alarm.
This car goes through spark plugs quickly. It eats up a set every eight months or so, and mine blew the valve cover gasket because of spark plug misfiring. Other than that, there have been few mechanical problems.
My Elantra GLS came with a lot of equipment for the price. It is loaded with every option available on a car of its class. A buyer should take into account the amount of options he/she gets for a very reasonable price when considering the Elantra. The low price occasionally is evident when taking sections of the car apart. Often, Hyundai has used plastic fasteners and parts instead of more durable metal ones. Of course, you always get what you pay for, and the Elantra was not conceived as a masterpiece of engineering.
It is good, reliable transportation with lots of bells and whistles. I would definitely buy another Hyundai, especially considering their exceptional warranty. Next time, however, I will strongly consider a larger model such as the Sonata or Santa Fe, as my family has outgrown our Elantra.<br><br>
