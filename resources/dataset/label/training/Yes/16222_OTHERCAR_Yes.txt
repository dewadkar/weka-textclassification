            I bought this car because me beloved Subaru finally gave up after 309,000 miles.  See my review of the <a href="/content_107913186948">1990 Subaru Legacy</a> Since I commute 800-1,000 miles a week I needed a replacement ASAP.  I decided to go a little newer with fewer miles to start, but I still needed something cheaper that I could put a lot of miles on.  I had researched passenger cars new and used for about the last year so I knew I wanted a Corolla or a Sentra. I found some almost new Sentras for about $10,000, but then I came across this car for $6,630.  
I bought the VE model.  I think VE must stand for very economical. This car is a 5-speed with radio/cassette and an A/C. The car has 120 hp and gets 36-38 mpg on the highways with an average speed of 65mph. 

THE RIDE
	Okay is the best way to describe it. The engine makes the same noise as my dads little '91 Ford Ranger Truck.  Not a deep vroom, vroom noise but more like a toy noise.  Going down the freeways is fine, but going threw the gears it makes the noise as the engine revs up. A side note: Do not put coins in the coin holder, this is a very loud and annoying sound, just put your coins in the ash tray. 
	The acceleration of this car is okay.  You can&#146t expect too much from 120 hp.  If you want to really push the car and go you can, but it wasn&#146t designed to be treated that way.  If I had to guess I would say that its 0-60 is about 10 seconds.  It has about the same acceleration as my old Subaru, so I can not complain too much. 
This car is fun to flip around little corners, but old my Subaru gripped the road a little better.  This car has brand new tires on it, not some cheap ones but some 60,000 mile Michelins.  The car is really light and so it doesn&#146t hang on to the road very tight so make sure you hang on to it on windy days, bumpy roads, and tight corners.  My car has nice tight alignment.  I can let go of the wheel for about a ï¿½ mile and it will pretty much stay where I left it in the lane. 
	I really like the suspension, compared to what I was use to, it is very smooth. You will feel the bumps, just maybe not all of them. 
	This car really shifts nice and smooth, but if you have bad knees or week muscles you better just go with the automatic. The clutch is pretty stiff and a little springy. 
	The brakes work well and they also require more effort.  I think this can be a good thing though.  Driving my friends new VW, I always feel like I am braking too hard for the situation.  In this car you get out what you put in.  You jump on the brakes and you will stop in a hurry, you tap them you just slow down a bit. 

INTERIOR 
	Basic.  I must say I like this car's steering wheel a lot better than that ugly one they have in the 2003/2004s. The interior is very basic.  The stereo is at a good height and the climate options are just bellow it. The stereo is suitable to the car nothing fancy, but a better sound than expected.  Like I said I only have cassette, but there is a nice compartment below the radio where a portable CD player could be placed. 
   My interior is the light tan/beige color scheme.  The seats are nice and firm.  I am only 5'2 and I have plenty of room, but someone who is 6 feet may be uncomfortable in this car.  Since I am short I have to pull my seat way forward and this allows more room in the back.  So I would say that two average to smaller size adults could sit in the back comfortably. I recently found out that two booster seats and one narrower car seat can fit in the back.  
   The front seat belts are height adjustable which is nice for me, so the belt doesn't dig into my collar bone and leave an ugly mark. The front seats are not height adjustable or electric and the rear seat does not fold down.  
The trunk is larger than it looks. You could easily fit two really large suit case in there  (standing on side)and one or two medium ones off to the side.  
The climate controls make for a great ride. The year round temperature I drive in ranges from 25-115 degrees F and it keeps me comfortable.  
The lights/turn signals, and windshield wipers are all basic. The windshield wipers do have different settings so they do not have to be on high all the time.  The lights automatically turn on for safety a few seconds after the car is started.  
This car also comes standard with passenger and drivers side airbags so it is relatively safe.

EXTERIOR
	I have always thought these were cute simple cars.  Nothing unusual about its looks, just a few lines to give it some character. My biggest dislike is the gas tank on the driver's side.  I am not a lefty, so why do I feel like I need to be to fill this car up? 
I bought this car with 39,000 miles and it was in beautiful shape. Two very minor scratches that were touched up and one ding and one dent. My car is white and I like its clean appearance, but it does show dirt a lot and dirty water marks do not come off so easily. 

Update 12/15
Squeaks and rattles:
The doors squeak when opened or closed occasionally, I just need to add some oil.  This is probably because the car really wasn't used that much.  Also noticed that if glove box is not slammed closed it will rattle a little bit while driving.  
I have noticed that the paint seems kind of cheap.  I don't know if this is because the car has only been waxed once or twice in its life, or if it is just the way the paint is.  

Took car in for service in Redwood City at Toyota 101, they charged me $20 to patch a flat, and already had started fixing it before asking. They told me 15 minutes, and 45 minutes later car still wasn't ready.  They washed the car but left all the road tar on it. (What was the purpose of wasting my time washing it when they weren't cleaning it??!!??)
