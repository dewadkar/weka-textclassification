            I bought a Camry and I absolutely love it.  It has great handling, and it is very reliable.  I have not had any problems with the car mechanically either.  I call it old reliable.  When choosing a car, I researched all of the different manufacturers and the brands of cars, and I felt that Toyota had the best reputation.  I first fell in love with it after renting one and drove it out of town and I was really comfortable.  Also, it gets excellent gas mileage.  I live in Atlanta and was able to drive to Tennessee and back on one tank of gas.  The only thing I hate about the car is that I did not buy one sooner.  It is family friendly also with all of the child lock features, and also for those who want to haul a big item home, the back seat lets down extending a very large trunk space.<br><br>
