Looking at a number of new trucks including the new Toyota Tundra and following a look at the Dodge Ram, I immediately bought a Dodge Ram 1500 4x4.  I've owned Fords and Chevy.  The Fords were terrible, and granted the Chevys gave me years of decent service, but it was time for a change.  In my mind, the Dodge is a real truck.  The 5.9L is most impressive and has never let me down when hauling heavy loads. The truck is comfortable and has been a reliable vehicle.  I have not had the run of repair problems and defects that some others have sited.  I believe a bit of care, wisedom, and preventative maintenance will ensure years of good service.  This truck has a loyal following so there are numerous people who was familiar with the ins and outs of this vehicle and there are numerous performance accessories for it.  One would never be without help or advise should an issue arise with this truck.  Dodge has a winner and even Ford recognized it having recently copied the Dodge Ram.
