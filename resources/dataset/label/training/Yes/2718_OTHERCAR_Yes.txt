            I just recently traded in a small car for my 1997 Suzuki Sidekick.  It's a four door, automatic with air, air bags, power steering, an alarm system, automatic windows, automatic locks, automatic mirrors, and of course--four wheel drive. 

Before I purchased my Sidekick, I had a front wheel drive car that was not doing well at all in the snow.  Where I am going to live after my marriage, the roads are dirt, stone, and surrounded by trees therefore making the roads very snow covered and treacherous all winter long.  I ran off the road into a ditch in my car and decided it was time to search for a four wheel drive.

My fiance has been living in this area for over a year, and he knows the bad conditions very well.  He himself has a 1994 Suzuki Sidekick, and he recommended the Suzuki for me.  I took his advice and began my search for the perfect Sidekick.

I found several on my journey, and discovered that they were pricier than I hoped they would be.  They are still a great car for the price, but my budget is very tight so I had a hard time getting one at the right price.  I finally found a dealer who went $2200 off the price and gave me a 60 month term, so I was able to drive off the lot with it the same day.

Upon driving the Sidekick for the first time, I noticed that it has a fairly smooth ride for the type of car it is.  It's not very loud at all, and I like that feature a lot because I tend to get annoyed by a noisy car.  It's rather slow on the uphill driving, and you almost have to force it to go up any hill at all.  It's a four cylinder, so I expected as much.  I just try to laugh as people start to either pass me or tailgate.  

The drive to see my fiance is a three hour trip, and I must say that the car did a wonderful job at keeping me comfortable the entire time.  I found no discomfort whatsoever in my trip.  It does a little worse on gas than a small car obviously would, and it's even worse when you are in four wheel drive.  

Speaking of the four wheel drive--I love it.  I am able to go in and out of the dirt roads at a faster than turtle speed now.  I feel a lot safer now because I have total control over my vehicle in the snow.  So far I have had no problems with it in bad weather.

Over all, I love my Sidekick.  It's perfect for me and my upcoming Northern Pa lifestyle.  It does great in the snow, looks great to the eye, and rides quite nicely.  I'm glad I took my fiance's advice to buy this car.  He's had his for several years, and has over 130,000 miles on it.  I'm sure I will get the same satisfaction and dedication from mine.
