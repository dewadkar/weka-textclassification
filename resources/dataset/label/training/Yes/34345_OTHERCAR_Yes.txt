               <b>I</b>n the 1970s, and 1980s, almost everyone thought that Japanese car makers could not build high quality sporty luxury cars; at the time they were right. In time however, we were all proved wrong, most noted when the 1989 Infiniti (Nissan's luxury line) Q45 made its debut, that, and the Lexus ( Toyota's luxury line) line-up came out.



<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

  The Infiniti Q45 offers super sophistication. In a Q45, the ground is covered effortlessly and smoothly, thanks to its uprated <b>suspension</b> even harsh road surfaces feel like a pillow. Despite the exotic engine spec, the 32 valve, DOHC, VVT V8 offers an incredible 90% of its maximum (278lb-ft) torque at a mere 2,000 RPM. But if you want to get a move on, the Q45 is more than happy to oblige. When the engine revs over 6,000 RPM, the V8 emitts the perfect engine note while utilizing all of its smooth horse power. <b>Handling</b> is taut, and the steering is excellent with the optional touring suspension this excellent handling is increased.

    <b>T</b>he basic spec of the Infiniti Q45 V8 sounds impressive enough, but there is more to it than alloy construction, four valves per cylinder and four camshafts. The inlet valve timing changes beyond 4,600 RPM, when the intake cams are rotated relative to the camshaft. Intake valve timing is retarded 20 degrees, improving engine breathing. Below 4,600 RPM, normal timing returns. This system allows good low down torque and high RPM power. A similar system is also availabe in the Lexus LS 400 and many other 2003 modeled luxury cars. 


 <b>Infiniti</b> has followed the in the foot steps of established luxury sedan manufacturers like BMW, Jaguar, and Mercedes in making its flagship rear wheel drive. The space saving properties of front wheel drive are not as important in large cars like the Q45, not to mention that the power can be dealt with more easily, not as much torque steer, etc..


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

  The <b>interior</b> of the 1998 Infiniti Q45 is simply amazing. I have been in some Rolls Royce's that did not feel this Luxurious. The steering wheel is leather wrapped, there is a cool clock  above the stereo system that gives you that 'old money' feel, most commonly felt in Jaguars. There is a perfect blend of wood and quality leather; not too much wood like in some cars that give it more of a tacky feel than luxury. The door handles inside are my only complaint, they are very foreword on the door, and are made of thin metal. 
The power seats are comfortable and supportive, ergonomics are perfect, and unlike many new luxury cars there is not that much clutter to deal with. The drivers position in the 1998 Q45 is excellent, offering tons of vision in all direction.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

    The <b>exterior</b>, while no Mercedes in terms of presence, it is very sporty, and bold. In response to the allegations that the original Q45 styling was bland, Infiniti has given the 1997-2002 models more conventional sports luxury car styling. This is not a car that will turn heads, but its also a car that won't get lost in traffic.


<i>Pricing:</i>

   The <b>price</b> for the Infinti Q45 ran around $50,000 new for 1998, this price is fair considering the advanced engine, the handsome looks, and all the standard luxury. Today the price remains high for a 1998, Infiniti has excellent resale value, and a Q45 for '98 will probably cost you near or over $30,000.

  I can not comment on reliability because I have not owned this car, but I have had the chance to drive one, they seem very solid. <b>Consumer Reports.Org</b>
