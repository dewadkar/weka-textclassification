            The SD100 is a good addition to the stable of high quality Canon digital cameras.  The market is becoming so saturated with choices in the low-mid price range that one can find many relatively equivalent choices amenable to simple price comparisons. While many reviewers on several sites have expressed some preference for the SD10, the SD100 is a good first foray into the SD category rather than CF for Canon.  
   Furthermore, the SD100 has most of the features of the S400 that any beginning digital camera user would actually use on a regular basis, for a significant amount of savings. 
   The SD100 battery charger is improved over earlier models, with a pretty quick charging time that can be a life-saver on vacation or before your kid's birthday party, etc.  It is a very small and light camera that easily fits into pockets for on-the-go users.
   On the downside, the camera does not come with a cover or protector, and the Canon website said they were on back order.  Thus, I am still using the styrofoam that it came in for protection in my pocket or briefcase, risking damage to the LCD screen.  
   The camera can feel a little flimsy in their efforts to make it light.  The on/off button and zoom button are very delicate and unlikely to last forever.  Also, the battery and memory card compartment door has spontaneously opened in my pocket from the friction of walking, not latching securely enough.  Also the rubber protector of the connector cable compartment seems unlikely to last through significant use.
   However, in sum this camera is easy to use, with many intuitive controls that require minimal learning to gain functionality, and remains a good choice at below $300.
