            This is one of the last of the 'no-rust' Trans Sports. For folks in the rust belt states, this feature alone makes the vehicle worth the money. My van now has 167,000 miles on it. Repairs: 3 sets of brakes ($1300), one transmission overhaul ($1100) one alternator ($400), power window switches and a motor ($520). GM seems to have an ongoing problem with the power window circuits on both the Chevy and Pontiac vans.
 It looks just like it did the day I bought it! The finish is excellent. The lack of rust, dents and dings, due to the composite body material was a wonderful idea. Too bad that Pontiac and Chevrolet decided to go back to sheet metal rust buckets for the new versions.
 The vehicle has lots of room and easy to remove seats for hauling big loads or large items. The interior looks huge when you sit behind the wheel but if you park next to a sedan and compare the length, there's little difference.
 The 3.8 V6 engine, provides the power and acceleration for highway driving in any location.
 Seating and ride is very comfortable, being more like a large sedan than a van and the driver seat has a high/low setting that elevates shorter drivers about 4&quot; for a better viewing position. The front passenger seat reclines, the other seats do not. You'll find individual controls for passengers in the rear for the radio and the blower and in some models, a second air unit.
 GM provided a multi-level child safety system for these units with Power locks, and a key tag remote control feature. All the doors lock when you engage transmission. Do try to get a vehicle with the power sliding door lock that prevents accidental opening. It requires the driver to use the armrest mounted release button and place the transmission in Park, before the sliding door can be opened by the driver or passengers. Driver can also disengage the power door control located on the door post for passenger use, with the touch of a switch. Dashboard indicator lights for partially open doors. Traction control and slippery conditions dashboard alert light, can help keep the unit on the road!
 
These vans are selling for around $9,000 to $12,000 and they make an excellent value for the family not ready to plunge $30,000 into a new SUV or a great second vehicle.<br><br>
