            This is our second Windstar.  This vehicle was purchased in April and is 1999 model.  We previously owned a 1995 model and there have been tremendous improvements made.  I absolutely love having two sliding doors and especially like having the one that's remote activated.  As a mom of three under 7, this really comes in handy.  There are many times that I could use a third arm and this just does the trick.  The amount of interior room seems to have been increased.  With all the cubby holes for storage, it really makes keeping things organized easy.  We recently took our first road trip and she purred like a kitten the whole 900 miles.  Everyone was comfortable and sleeping for the kids was a breeze.  I personally like the Windstar above all the rest because it handles like a car.  Our other car is a Jeep and there is absolutely no comparison between these two vehicles.  The Windstar is more like a luxury auto than a van and I would recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone.<br><br>
