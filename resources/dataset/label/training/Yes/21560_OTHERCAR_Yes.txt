            <b><i>�What�s this?� you ask?  Suzuki�s somewhat successful attempt at an economy car.</b>  While not the best car out there for the money, it is cute, and it does take you where you want to go.</i>

<b><i>Da Looks�</b></i>
Hey!! What do you want for the price?  It�s available in the regular model as well as a wagon.  It�s whichever suits you.  Bottom line is that the looks are well worth the price, but won�t satisfy a former BMW owner.  The wagon body is 171 inches long.

<b><i>On The Inside�</b></i>
The inside is definitely more impressive than the outside.  Its very spacious (89.5 cubic feet of space to be precise) interior is pleasing.  The back seat splits to provide even more room.  The standard equipment inside includes air-conditioning, 4 speaker Clarion stereo cassette, carpeting, fold-down rear seat, tinted glass, dual cupholders, remote releases for trunk and fuel box, and an electric rear-window defogger.  Other options will be discussed later on with the several models of the <i>Esteem</i>.

<b><i>The Models�</b></i>
The Esteem is available in three models: the GL, GLX, and GLX+.  All models include a 1.6L 4 cylinder engine, 4 wheel independent suspension, rack and pinion steering, and power brakes.  By upgrading the the GLX, you add better upholstery, power windows/door locks, outside power mirrors, tachometer, vanity mirrors, split fold-down rear seat, trunk light, full wheel covers, and larger tires.  The GLX+ is available only in automatic and includes cruise control.  The main feature is the anti-lock brakes.

<b><i>Safety Features�</b></i>
- Daytime Running Lights
- Rear-door Child Safety Locks
- Side Impact Beams
- Dual Front Airbags
- Lap &amp; Shoulder Belts (for all passengers)

<b><i>Who�s It For?? </b></i>
It appears that Suzuki is aiming this vehicle at young families with an active lifestyle.  At such an affordable price, almost anyone can handle it.  If you need that car to drag stuff around in and not have to worry about ruining it, this is certainly the car.  If you are looking for luxury or a great ride, look elsewhere!
