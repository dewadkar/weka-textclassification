            My live-in girlfriend and I recently bought a 1.8T Audi A4, and we have been very satisfied with our purchase.  Here are the good and bad points about the car.

Style--Amazing.  This is a sleek looking attention getting European car.  Audi has done a great job in making a car that looks both hot and smooth.  The A4 looks as nice as the BMW 3-series, and the A6 and A8 stand in a class above.

Driving--Excellent.  The 1.8T has ample pick-up.  We opted for the manual transmission because it more fun to drive and better priced.  The A4 was quick enough, but it is no speed demon.  Overall the acceleration is more than adequate though.  
The most amazing part of driving this car is its handling ability.  The Audi quattro system is spectacular.  First off it is important to understand that I usually drive a 1997 BMW M3, and I think it handles brilliantly.  This A4, with 15 inch wheels (compared to 17 inch wheel on my BMW) handles better.  Yeah, I know I was shocked myself. I took my M3 on a drive, and made a sudden U-turn, the car responded my making the turn, but slightly losing its grip.  The traction control then kicked in and fixed everything in a second, but you could feel the slight swerve. I then took the A4 out and made the same sudden U-turn at the same speed.  Nothing at all.  There was no slippage.  The car stayed glued to the road, and did not lose a thing.  The quattro was really first class.

However, the A4 is not a perfect car. The major flaw in the car is the design of the clutch. The clutch is very long and is not easy to engage. Additionally, the clutch occasionally will not engage properly. I have driven four different Audi A4 and all of them have the same problem. The clutch should also engage at an earlier stage of its long shaft, for quicker smoother shifting. There is just no reason for a car this nice to have such a poorly designed clutch. A simple Honda/Acura clutch is 10 times easier and better to drive. 

Interior--The inside of the A4 is sleek and nice, but has room for improvement.  The headrests are slightly too big for the car, and get in the way of the driver's line of vision.  The control panel on our A4 had too many buttons.  This may be because we opted for the Bose sound system, but that in addition to the climate control buttons makes it hard to find the right button without first taking your eyes off the road for a while. 
The highlights of the interior are its nice comfortable seats, folding down rear seats, and sunroof.  The front seats are great.  You can adjust the seats to just about any conceivable position, and get cozy for a short or long trip.  The back seats are OK, but I would not recommend them for any one over 6 foot unless there is a real short person in the front seat giving them more room.  
The sunroof was also well designed.  With the simple turn of a button you can either open or shut the sunroof, or keep it in some place in-between.  
The back seats also fold down completely.  This feature came in very helpful when we went to a friend's house and picked up a futon.  The entire full size futon fit in the trunk with the seats folded down. This was so incredible. 

Overall this is a good car.  We purchased the car for around $26,500.  I think the car was a good value, although this is still a lot of money, and there is the clutch problem.  As most people know if you want a nice sleek European car you better be willing to pay for it.
