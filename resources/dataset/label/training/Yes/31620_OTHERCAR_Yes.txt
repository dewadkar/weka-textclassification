            When I was a kid I always wanted to take lots of pictures but it was TOO expensive to develop the pictures. Also, if I didn't like a picture I still had to pay to develop it! The Nikon Coolpix 800 makes me wish I was a kid again. 

My father purchased the Nikon Coolpix 800 before our family trip to Hong Kong. Unfortunately during the trip my father was not feeling too well and several days we went out without him. Fortunately I had brought my PowerBook along with me. Using the CompactFlash card (used by the CoolPix 800 to store your pictures) and a PC card CompactFlash adapter I was able to instantly download the day's pictures to my PowerBook and show them to my Dad so he didn't feel quite as left out. 

I have a 14 inch screen on my PowerBook and the images from the digital camera filled the whole screen. They are very pretty pictures with lots of details and great color. To me these pictures are higher quality than standard photographs! and so much more flexible.

Steps to download pictures to my PowerBook
1. Turn the CoolPix off
2. Take the CompactFlash card out of the bottom of the CoolPix
3. Insert the CompactFlash card into the SimpleTechnology CompactFlash adapter (the CompactFlash adapter is a type 2 PC card)
4. Insert the CompactFlash card adpater into your PC card slot
5. A disk will show up on your desktop named Untitled
6. On the disk you will find all of your pictures named DSCN000n.
7. DoubleClick the picture and you will see a stunning picture with very high quality.

SO EASY! You can copy the pictures to your hard disk, send them in e-mail - whatever you want. 

The CoolPix has a nice 1 inch LCD on the back so you can view your images. If you take a picture that you do not want to keep you can easily delete it. The interface is very simple. You can take pictures in Automatic mode and the camera will make all of the decisions for you (such as turning on the Flash automatically (you can turn it off though). You can also take pictures in Manual mode and change the camera's settings.  A feature that I really like is the ability to take a sequence of 16 pictures. I used this at the park with my dog to take a sequence of pictures of him running towards me. I am hoping to make it into a little movie. 

If you want to have fun with pictures I recommend the CoolPix as an easy to use camera with very good picture quality. <br><br>
