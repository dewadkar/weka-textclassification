            I now own a 1988 Toyota Camry.  I haven't been extremely impressed with it like I thought I would be.  It's probably one of the most reliable and long lasting 1988 models.  However, the car has some mechanical flaws that I found pretty disappointing.
First of all, the engine can be extremely anemic and surges going up hills, especially if there are ANY passengers in the car.  The engine is very smooth running though and is whisper quiet at idle.  The quietness of the engine is mostly ignored by occupants because the engine vibrates harshly at idle.  I have had too many problems with this car leaking oil.  For a while, it was leaving basket-ball size oil stains in my driveway.  So, I took it in to the shop to get fixed.  I've brought it in three times so far and that seemed to fix the problem for a month or so.  Except it's leaking oil again!
  The 4-speed automatic transmission is smooth shifting, except in full throttle acceleration when it tends to slam into each gear.  I live in a very hilly part of the U.S where a car that has power to get up hills is important.  Most people that live in fairly flat parts of the country probably don't experience this problem having no power on hills.  
The build quality also is somewhat disappointing.  There are just too many squeaks and rattles.  The shocks are extremely squeaky and some interior trim pieces buzz and rattle.  Over-all though, it's well built for an '88 when compared to other 1988 American cars.
I also own a 1992 Plymouth Acclaim (my granny car).  So far, I've gotten 180,000 miles out of the original engine and transmission and it still runs good!  So, when I hear stories about someone getting 200,000 miles out of a Camry, I am impressed but not impressed.
I wrote this epinion because I am considering buying either a 1992 Camry or 1992 Honda Accord.  They are both nice looking cars inside and out and are both reliable.  They both have a 2.2L 4-cylinder engine.  However, the '92 Camry is actually a larger car than the '92 Accord.  The Accord has a more expensive looking interior that I like though.  I can't decide!  I will take a test drive of each car before I make a definite decision.
