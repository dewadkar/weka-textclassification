            My husband and I have needed a larger car for several years now. I pushed for one when my son was born because with a large car seat and diaper bag, there was no room in our small car for anything else. My husband always argued saying there was no way he would be caught dead driving a minivan. He would get an SUV before it came to that. 

Then...one car seat became 2 and he finally accepted the fact that we NEEDED a larger car. Imagine my joy when he finally said "okay, we'll just look at minivans."...

The car salesman showed us to the only minivan they had in our price range, a 98 Plymouth Voyager. As he opened the doors I hung back and watched the expression on my husband's face, certain that he would grimace and say "we'll go home and think about it." Meaning that under no circumstances would we be back. I was shocked when he grinned at me and said how nice it looked. He hopped in the drivers seat and opened the passenger door, I was amazed at the room! I had never been in a minivan before and was surprised at all the room! My husband was pleased that it only had 42,000 miles. Our old clunker had well over 120,000, and was breaking down every 2 months. The salesman showed us all the perks, such as the grocery bag hooks on the back of the seat (never have our groceries stayed so neat on the trip home), all the compartments and drink holders. "Do you want to give it a test-drive?" the salesman asked. My husband was all too eager, so I stayed at the dealership and watched our 2 little ones while he drove. "It handles great!" he said as he walked up to me a while later. We filled out the paperwork and my husband beamed as he got back in the minivan to drive it home. 

That was several weeks ago and I finally got the chance to drive it myself. (My husband insisted on driving everywhere, he loves it so much.) It handles like a dream, and is perfect for 2 kids. Shopping is no longer a chore, (oh no, I can't buy that. It's too big to fit in the car!), and we are looking forwards to Christmas shopping this year. We will be able to buy all the things we wanted to last year, but could not fit into the trunk! So far we are very happy to buy a Plymouth Voyager. Even my husband, who originally said he would never consider it, says this is the best vehicle he has ever bought.
