            Coming from a large, rather un-affluent family, my 2 brothers and my father were always working on cars.  In the freeze of winter and into the heat of summer somebody's car needed a fixing.  

I was never into cars, and quite frankly, rarely helped in their oil-dirty endeavors.  So, when it came around to me getting my first, brand new car, my father steadfastedly proclaimed it would be a Toyota.  The question, in which I acquiesced, was &quot;Is it going to be a new, affordable Corolla, or a used Camry?&quot;  The Camrys are beautiful, even at 3 years old.  But, it didn't surpass my desire for a brand new car.  The reason my father pushed Toyota so hard was that he's getting ready to retire and he wouldn't have to do much more car work.  And, a brand new car comes with a very good warranty.  Repairs would be somebody else's problem, not my knuckle-scarred father's.

I purchased a 1999 CE, the middle of the Corolla line.  I really like it.  It's dependable, and I finally have a car with some kick when it comes to dodging around the interstate.  Despite its 4 cylinders, it does have some &quot;go&quot; in it.  But, when the car is full of people, you notice a sizeable decrease in performance.  Probably won't make a very good commuter car on the California interstates when your bogged down with four adults in the car.

I did not like very much the power of the rear-defogger/deicer.  It is weak.  Further, why isn't there a rear windshield window wiper?  The windshield is at an angle where fallen rain just likes to sit.  I definitely would get one.  

I DO NOT like how when you pull the handle to get out it won't automatically unlock the door.  Either you have to pull the knob manually or use the electronic locks which open all four doors.  I like to use my electronic locks minimally, only when I need to, because they're always the first thing to go.

You'll love the lever that unlocks the trunk.  I do.  Same with the lever for the gas cover.

I wish the vehicle had a little more interior lights.  But this isn't enough to decide a tie.

Overall, I am proud and happy with my first new car purchase.  There's a certain responsibility that comes with a new car.  You treat her better, you drive slower, you're more careful on the road.  This was an unexpected bonus because my chances of survival are now greatly enhanced.  I can't think of a better car to have that bonus with.

Good Luck in you car search!!!<br><br>
