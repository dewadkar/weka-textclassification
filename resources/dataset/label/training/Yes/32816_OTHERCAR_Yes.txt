            The first stick shift I ever drove was a brown VW van.  I was raised in Hawaii and it was the ultimate surf vehicle.  I remember my grandpa looking over from the passenger side seat and saying, �What Bobby?  You chicken?  You jus� put da ting in firs geah and go foh it.� (For a rough translation ask somebody you know who grew up in Hawaii and speaks �Pidgin English�)  I�ve had several cars since them.  Some of them were great and some were lemons.  I have to say that my current car, a 1995 Chevy Cavalier, is up towards the �great� end of the cars I�ve owned.

My wife owned a 1985 Chevy Cavalier as we were getting married.  She bought it used with over 100,000 miles on it and drove it imprudently.  After a new water hose, starter and a set of brakes the car still plugged along faithfully.  She actually sold the thing for more than she bought if for and it continued to run without a hitch.

I brought my 1995 Chevy Cavalier into our marriage after making the original purchase with my first wife.  It was the first car we test-drove and we bought it because she thought it looked �pretty�.  I didn't really disagree with her statement.  It actually was a very good-looking car.  And it was kind of sporty for a four door, which is a necessity when you have children. (The 4-door part, not the sporty part)

  But it's been more than a pretty car.  It�s approaching 100,000 miles and my service log has included some 30 odd oil changes, a new set of tires and one new set of brakes.  Actually, there was some additional bodywork done on the vehicle that involved a new rear quarter panel and bumper, but we'll save that story for when Epinions.com has a review section on Utah drivers.

All in all the car has been rugged, functional, and �pretty� to boot.  The cavalier came standard with several extras like 4-wheel ABS, cruise control and child safety locks.  My one complaint about the car would be its lack of trunk space.  Although I do realize that the car is more of a compact than anything else, the trunk effectively holds one stroller and that�s about it.

If I had to explain what a nice low maintenance car my Cavalier has been, I would have to use the words of my wise (if not somewhat unrestrained) grandfather.

�You jus� put da ting in firs geah and go foh it.�
