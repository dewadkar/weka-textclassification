            Right before graduation, my '87 Grand Am finally rolled over and died.  Faced with college and a summer job, I needed a car, Quick!  After searching the Tulsa car market and coming up broke, except for a '95 Eclipse with known mechanical problems, my uncle's wife's sister's 1997 Dodge Avenger was our solution.  I paid $6,000 for my "pull me over red", 2.5 litre 4cylinder and could not be happier with it.  
  The motor runs almost silently, and with 96k miles on it, the biggest repair I'm currently looking at is replacing the idler belt and the timing chain.  These motors, along with the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Eagle Talons have a known problem with the timing belt/chain.  In the Avenger, the problem has been acknowledged and the housing for the timing chain is on top of the motor for easy access, unlike those in Chevrolets and Fords.  
   My biggest complaint is the ambiguity of the owner's manual; my dad is a do-it-yourself mechanic and refuses to take cars to the shop.  The owner's manual has a few vague solutions for when the "Check Engine" light comes on, as mine recently has, so dad is having to systematically go through the engine and make small repairs while trying to find the real problem.
   Also, my Avenger has a very low turning radius; friends make fun of me when I back in and out of a spot trying to line it up, and I haven't quite nailed parallel parking in it yet ("Sean, will you come park her car?  She doesn't know how!") Also, I have to turn off the air conditioning to get up enough speed to enter the expressway; the acceleration is very slow, but all in all, I love my new car.
