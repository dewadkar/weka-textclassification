            I recently went shopping for a car.  I visited all of the main car companies.  Each place I went I was greeted within seconds of getting out of my car.  You could see the salesman swarming towards.  If it did not look bad they would have ran at me and tackled me.
  In some cases I was approached by several salesman from the same dealership.  Where did I end up?  I stopped looking when I got to Saturn.  There is no salesman rushing out to me to open my car door and escort me all over the lot.  I was able to look at my leisure.  No one approached me.  Even when I went inside.  I was able to go up to them when I was ready.
  The salesman answered all my questions.  I took a test drive.  The entire process was great.  The car runs excellent.  Saturn cars have a high resale value.  The get great gas mileage.  The service from the dealer continues even after the sale.
  The one thing I do not like is the leg room.  But for my budget I got the best car.  Saturn has luxury cars you can purchase.  The best bargain for the buck is Saturn.  You get no haggle over price.  You get a good car buying experience.  
   My next car will come from Saturn.  That is unless of course I come across a zillion dollars and get that lamborghini.  Until then though it is a Saturn for me.<br><br>
