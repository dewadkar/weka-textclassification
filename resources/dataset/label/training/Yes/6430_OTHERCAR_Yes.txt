            I needed a camera that was large enough to hold steady yet not so large that it was a hassle to carry around.  The camera is designed with a grip on the right and allows you to click the shutter button without moving the camera. 

The menu system is simplicity itself, without most of the complex settings you will find on other digital cameras.  If you are a professional photographer this isn't the camera for you.  If you want point and shoot with good quality pictures, high definition and good color you will enjoy this Fuji.

You choose 0.3M, 1M, 2M or 3M pixel resolution, it has manual settings (very few) and a sport setting that allows for motion, and my favorite, two video settings with sound, you can take up to 40 min on a 128MB card, perfect for the internet.

The LED screen is very Large and the menu is also large so you don't have to squint to read the setting choices, as I don't take pictures with my glasses on this is very helpful.

It uses XD cards which are hard to find and expensive to buy.  Also very few of the card readers and photo printers read XD cards so you will find yourself uploading directly from the camera.

I love that it's battery is 4 AA, I use rechargeable camera batteries and have yet to run out while using a 256 MB card. I use the video, always the flash and the large LED screen and still haven't run out of batteries.  Amazing, my other digital cameras eat batteries.

It has a 6X Zoom, however I don't like where the control is located, I'm used to the zoom being with the shutter button so I'm continually turning the camera off.  To use the zoom you need to pull away form the camera to find the control which is above the LED screen.

It's not going to fit in your pocket, but it is light weight even with the batteries in.  It comes with the neck strap, and the lens cap strap and you are set to go.

The picture quality is great and the colors are bright and true.  I'm really enjoying this purchase.
