            We purchased our used 1991 Plymouth Voyager about four years ago. We were looking for a bigger vehicle due to the birth of our third child. This was the best investment we have ever made. We now have almost 150,000 miles on it and it is still running great. Sure we have had a few minor, problems such as the rear wiper motor going out but with that many miles we are not complaining. I am the main driver of the Voyager and with two teenagers needing to go here and there it gets the miles put on and it has never let me down. I love the seating room it has. The air conditioner still works great and has never had to be recharged. The Plymouth voyager is a great family vehicle. We have taken it on long trips and it is comfortable to ride in. I will drive it until it dies and then go to a dealership and buy another one.<br><br>
