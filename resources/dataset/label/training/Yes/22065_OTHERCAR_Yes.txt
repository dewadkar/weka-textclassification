            We decided to buy a digital camera so we could send pictures over e-mail to our family who all live hours away.  So I talked to everyone I could about what features I should look for in a digital camera.  The Kodak DC215 was the lowest priced camera that had all of the features I considered important.

I absolutely love this camera,  it is so easy to use,  and being able to discard the pictures that I do not want when I take them is great.  Unlike a traditional camera I am not stuck with pictures of the kids making strange faces or with their eyes shut.  I can just shoot until I get the 'perfect  picture' and then off to grandma they go.  The little view screen on the back is my daughter and niece's favorite,  they just love seeing the picture after I take it.

I had no problem with the software that comes with the camera,  for downloading to our computer, if I had a complaint it would be that it is kind of slow,  I start the process and then do other things while waiting.
My husband however has yet to get the hang of the right steps to go through,  his would like a much simpler program.


I really like the features on the software that lets you play with your photos,  you can add text,  make the photos in to cards.  (Great for e-mail cards) And all sorts of other things.  However maybe it is just an oversight on my part but the feature that takes the red-eye away,  I can not make work.  However there is a flash feature to help eliminate this from happening when the photo is taken.


I would definitely recommend getting the AC power cord other wise this camera seems to eat batteries for lunch.  In the first 3 weeks I went through a lot of batteries,  then my husband got the AC adapter,  and I have bought batteries twice since then (5 months ago),  the downloading was using up all of the batteries not the actual picture taking.

Also,  I use the 'best' quality feature so I can only store 12 photos at a time on the camera,  since I use this around home it is no big deal for me,  but when we go on our next big trip I will definitely invest in a memory card that holds more photos.

I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend this camera for a novice like myself.<br><br>
