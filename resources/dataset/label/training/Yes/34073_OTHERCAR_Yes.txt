                 In a motoring world where generalized ergonomics continue drawing design, function and economy closer together for all makes, the personal luxury car itself has become almost stereotypical, and is less likely than ever to stand out from the crowd.

     Most manufacturers today seem to be stumbling and fumbling for new ways to have their dream car for the upper class exceptional in desire-ability. Innovations, however ridiculous in function or ghastly in appearance, have generally found their way on to the luxury car platform over the years simply because there had to be to create interest for potential buyers. That trend continues even today. Indeed that engineering and design mind-set remains unchanged as we witness total redesigns and new directions in the luxury car field. Thinking today seems to focus on one premise. What can we do to identify this car as one of ours yet make it so entirely different than anything before that people will buy it? What can we do that no one else is doing and how outlandish can we dare to be and still get away with it. I won't volunteer specifics here, but the definitions for what constitutes a luxury car are becoming more obscure with each passing model year.
   
    Being the owner of my second Mark VII (a 92, Green, moonroof, CD)
has proven to be such a consistently satisfying experience, I concede
that this one will be in my stable of American Classics for many years to come. A classic to me is one which was innovative in the beginning, stood out amongst the crowd throughout its reigning years and continues to draw interest, compliments, and admiration of others.

     This luxury vehicle package, provides the ultimate in classiness without the abundance of glitz, pomp and ceremony usually associated with personal luxury coupes. The functionality of the car is almost without compromise. The overall excellence of my ownership experience however lets me overlook just two small objections. One, in that there are no storage pockets in the frontal area of the doors and two, that you cannot
expect anything you set on the console to stay there once the car is in motion(common problem with most makes).
     Having owned many other luxury cars, as part of a larger stable of vehicles, this model offers the most in comfort, reliability, power and
functionality while remaining virtually unchanged for nine model years. It's lines are timeless. It's elegance is equally apparent and appealing in any setting, in any neighborhood. It draws admiring glances (although well disguised),from other luxury car owners and stands out significantly amongst the many &quot;look-alikes&quot; vying for recognition today.

To me, an enthusiast, participant in many modes of motor-sport and much accomplished on the car show circuit, the Lincoln Mark VII does exactly what it was created to do. To get you there in comfort, and once there declaring to those witnessing the event that you have arrived.
