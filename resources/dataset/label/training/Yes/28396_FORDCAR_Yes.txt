            The Taurus Wagon 2002 is not the station wagons of the 70's.  You know the ones you learned to drive in with the wood grain paneling and was mostly referred to as the Tank.

I previously owned a 1997 Taurus Wagon and when the lease was up we had to decide whether to buy or find something different.

Being extremely pleased with the 1997 car I really didn't want anything different, so we decided to upgrade and bought the same exact car but a newer year.  

I have been that pleased with the Ford Taurus cars.

The wagon has power windows and locks and gray cloth seats.  This 2002 model also has a power seat on the drivers side.

It is an automatic with a traction control button which is to help your front tires from spinning if stuck.  Haven't had to use it yet, but being in Michigan, I'm sure I will soon enough.

The one thing both my husband and I like about the Taurus Wagon is there is ample leg room in the middle, unlike many other wagons we tried out.

This 2002 model has added 2 cup holders for the passengers who sit in the middle.  This was a big plus for my kids, since they missed all the holders we had when we owned a Windstar Mini Van.

One difference is the brakes which seemed a little squishy on the 1997 version seem to be much better on the 2002.

Having only owned the 2002 version for a short time and not needing any maintenance work I can only speak in regard to the 1997 Wagon and say that other than regular maintenance, I never had a problem with the car. 

This car has a CD player and I have experienced no problems with it.

We have taken the car on a road trip and find it very comfortable.  This car has a luggage rack and if not using the back pop-up seat you can use the back for luggage as well.  

We had a sun roof added to the car which makes my driving experience even more pleasurable.  When not busing several children here and there, I forget it is a wagon I am driving.
