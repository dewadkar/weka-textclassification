            My husband surprised me with this camera for Valentine's Day last year.  We were headed to Hawaii.  What a great place to test it out for the first time!!  This camera is very user friendly and takes great pictures.  What I love about it is that I can send pictures right after I take them.  My parents live out of state, and my husband travels, so I send them pictures of the kids and they can see what they are doing and even what they are wearing that very day!  We are also building a house, so it makes it fun to show my mom the progress!

It doesn't have a zoom feature, but it does have 3 settings for distance from your subject.  It has 4 flash settings.  Automatic , No Flash, Always Flash, and Red Eye Reduction which is an automatic, double flash.  This camera has 4 resolution settings.  On the highest resolution it can take 12 pictures.  You can purchase extra memory cards, so that if you are out and can't download, you can take more pictures.


There are only 2 negative things that I can think of about this camera.  But I believe you will find these to be issues with any digital camera you purchase.  The first issue I have had is that it is very expensive to get prints made from the digital.  I combat this problem by taking my regular camera with me everywhere as well.  I can also print them on my own computer, but the results aren't very high quality.  

The other issue I have had is that this camera can eat up some batteries!  My solution for this has been to buy 2 sets of rechargeable batteries.  So now I have one set in the camera, and the other is always recharging!<br><br>
