            Two years ago my husband nagged and nagged for a digital camera.  We had a perfectly good 35mm, so I viewed it as an extravagance.  However, we shopped the stores and the internet for all the information we could find.
We decided on the Sony for one reason--floppy disks.  This camera is incredibly user-friendly.  It is the best investment we have ever made.
I have cases of &quot;photo albums&quot;.  This is the only line of digital camera with no memory cards to download, a real inconvenience if you are on vacation and don't happen to have a laptop.  It has a fully rechargeable battery, unlike the others, so that you are not eating up big bucks for batteries and carrying all that extra weight around so that you don't run out of batteries!  Using floppy disks makes it easy to e-mail, copy, and generally share your photos with everyone.  The viewing screen makes it easy to know if you missed you shot in time to take another one.  The various picture effects and special effects are fun.  The menu is very simple to use. The only slight inconvenience is the few seconds you must wait between pictures while the camera records.  But this is a very short interval and hardly noticeable.  For anyone who doesn't want to be over their head in computer technology, this is a wonderful camera.  Now you can even purchase a photo viewer and a photo printer, so that a computer is not even necessary for digital photography.<br><br>
