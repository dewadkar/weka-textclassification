            I recently got a 1997 Lumina as my company car.  This vehicle replaced a 1994 Dodge Caravan.  I initially thought, &quot;what a nice generic car!&quot;.  This opinion is changing the longer I have this car.  This car runs great and is very quiet.  There is tons of room inside, with plenty of room for three in back.  The front seat will also seat three but seemed a little tight to me.  The seats are like a comfortable couch.  

The heat and radio controls are in a convenient location.  I no longer need to bend down to change the heat or radio station as I did with the Caravan.  The radio gets good reception and you can do some adjusting of the type of reception depending on what you are listening to (Talk, Rock, pop, Country Western, etc...).  This make as big difference in the sound. 
Soon after  getting the car, I took a trip with lots of child stuff and luggage.  The trunk handled everything.  I was able to fit more stuff into the Lumina's trunk than I was ever able to fit into the Caravan.  One of the things that I like about the car are the storage pockets in the door and on the back of the seats.  There is a cup holder on the dash but it is in front of the radio controls.  When a cup is in the holder, it often rubs on the radio buttons.  The power windows work well with a convenient window lock to keep the kids from playing with the rear windows.  Visibility is good in this car.  I have not noted any blind spots.  My wife loves the reading lights on the rearview mirror.  While a &quot;generic&quot; looking fleet car, I am very impressed and happy with this car.  If you want a dependable car that is a great value, I recommend the Chevrolet Lumina.           <br><br>
