            The title may sound odd but I have an arthritic neck and therefore I didn't want a car that did not ride smoothly. We needed a new car and looked and drove all the cars in the same category:  LexusES300, Acura, Volvo, etc.  The I30 had the smoothest ride and was the easiest car to move in and out of.  It also had the best configuration giving one the sense of space and head room.  I love everything about this car--everything.  It accelerates rapidly and easily.  It has a great Bose audio system.  It has easy to use cup holders.  it is a dream to drive; it even takes potholes well.  Anyone who can afford this category of car should buy the I#0--I mean, everyone.<br><br>
