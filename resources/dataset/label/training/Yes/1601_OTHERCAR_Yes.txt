               I have purchased my 1995 GEO PRIZM used with only 11,000 miles which is not much for a Toyota engine. That is just the point of the Geo prizm a merge between Chevy and Toyota to form the New United Motor Corp. they have made a strong but affordable compact car that is using the same engine as the Toyota Corolla (all years). 

  I have made the discovery car shopping for the car and looking under the hood . If you look you will see the parts on the corolla and the prizm are the same ,when you buy parts some will say Toyota style . Well I have driven Toyota before and had good luck so I figured I would give it a shot and never has the car been to a shop for major repairs. I just tune it up,. I am very pleased with the car. 

  I have driven the car very long distances and have never had a problem 
if you are looking for a car that is good on gas and great on the road,then you are looking at the  Geo Prizm . Very Value priced,  usually depends on the year you buy  about $10,000 - $15,000 .<br><br>
