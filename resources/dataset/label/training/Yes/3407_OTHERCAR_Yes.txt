            We bought our Chevy Suburban new in 1993 and have thoroughly enjoyed everything about it except the gas mileage and parkability (Is that a word?). To put it bluntly, the fuel economy stinks. Thirteen mpg around town, sixteen mpg highway. However, if one can afford to pay thirty to forty thousand dollars for a heavy duty grocery getter, one should not complain about the gas mileage, or lack thereof. Also, in a crowded mall parking lot it is sometimes difficult to park. Gas mileage and parking aside, this has really been a good vehicle for us. During the summer we load our two kids with all our beach gear and tow our twenty three foot Hurricane deck boat the twenty miles or so to the coast. The vehicle is equipped with the factory towing package and the 3.73 ratio rear end, but to be honest I wish we had purchased the 2500 series 3/4 ton vehicle with the small block V-8. From what my friends with the 2500 tell me, the 3/4 ton tows trailers MUCH better than the 1/2 ton. We also enjoy the increased safety that a 5000 pound vehicle affords us as well. We have experienced a couple of problems with the vehicle, one is a nagging water leak that originates somewhere in the seal area where the two back doors meet near the top of the vehicle. The other was a corroded fitting on the rear of the intake manifold that one of the heater hoses attached to. This was a potentially serious problem due to the fact that had the fitting corroded to the point of breaking completely off, a rapid loss of engine coolant would have occurred and if not detected immediately would have caused the engine to overheat, possibly damaging it, not to mention stranding the vehicle and it's occupants. Had I not been blessed with the services of a local non-dealer mechanic, this would have been an expensive repair job due to the fact that the dealer was going to remove the entire intake manifold in order to facilitate repair. My local mechanic repaired the vehicle without removing the intake, thus saving us a good deal of money. The dealer worked on the leak (under warranty) several times and it is somewhat better but still leaks a little during a heavy rain. Other than these two incidents, we've had virtually no problems. I would buy another one, but instead of new I would try and find a good used one. Thirty two thousand dollars (32,000-40,000 now) for a way to go is a bit much for me.<br><br>
