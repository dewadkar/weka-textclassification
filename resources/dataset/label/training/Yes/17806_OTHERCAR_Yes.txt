             My title says it all: this car really is the best RWD car for the money you'd spend on it! Let me tell you a little about my experiences with mine...
 I bought my 91 240sx Fastback for $2200 after my Nissan Pickup detonated a cylinder. Tragic, I know. Anyway, a buddy of mine told me he was selling his 240 and I jumped at the chance to buy it.
 Since that purchase, I have had nothing but great experiences with the car. When I purchased it, it already had an Injen intake, NGK wires, Fireball headers and an ECU mod installed! The suspension was modded with Eibach springs (which lowered the car 2 inches or so) and rolled on lightweight 17" Seneca rims wrapped in 225/45/17 Yokohama AVS Sports.
 The 240sx is a well-balanced car, even in its torquey, KA-powered configuration. (For those who do not know, the Jap-Spec 240sx, called the Silvia, is powered by a much more impressive engine, the turbo SR. Look it up.) While it certainly isn't the fastest car on the road, it's still pretty quick. This car opened my automotive world up to _real_ driving, and I began experimenting with drift and torque steer. Needless to say, these adventures have caused more trouble than they might be worth, but that's what driving hard is all about.
 There are drawbacks, sadly, to such a car. As far as utility is concerned, the fastback model seems to fit more stuff behind the backseat, but it's still a small space. The backseat itself is a little more than a seat-shaped shelf for stuff you might throw there. It's really not practical for transporting humans. Also, some people may not like the noise of the engine (it's pretty loud, even in stock form) or the tire roar in the rear. As for myself, I don't mind it.
 If you can get ahold of one of these machines, do so. I'd be the first to admit that it could use some more power, but once you realize the flexibility of Nissan's Silvia/240sx, this problem will be something to either be overlooked or corrected, depending on your needs. All in all, this car rocks and I would recommend it to anyone who really _enjoys_ driving.
