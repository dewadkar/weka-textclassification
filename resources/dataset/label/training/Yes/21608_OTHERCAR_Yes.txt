            My brother, who likes to venture out into the wilderness wanted a vehicle that could tackle &quot;4WD only&quot; trails as well as trips into the snow. Originally, he was looking for a Jeep Cherokee with 4.0 liter Inline-6 cylinder engine, but when we saw a high mileage 1994 Grand Cherokee with 5.2 liter V8, leather seats, top-of-the-line sound system and almost all options in the classifieds for $16,500, we decided to check it out. That was about 3 years ago. He still owns the SUV. On occasion, I tag along with him to camping, hiking, and cross-country skiing trips. I get to drive it most of the time, too. 

<b>High Mileage, but Not Abused</b>
When purchased second-hand, the Jeep had almost 80,000 miles on it. The interior was clean, and the undercarriage didn't have any trace of dirt or &quot;off-road stains.&quot; Of course, the body looked brand new. The previous owner claimed the car was mainly used for freeway commuting, hence the high miles. When I test drove the car, it felt pretty fresh for ~80,000 miles. When my brother took the car to a mechanic for a check-up, everything was A-OK. This is a testament to the Grand Cherokee's ruggedness, even for mundane commute duties.

<b>Plenty of Power</b>
The 5.2 liter V8 is an evolution of the solid &amp; reliable Dodge/Chrysler 318ci small block. Using multi-port fuel injection, the engine outputs about 220 hp. On the freeway, I have no problems passing other cars, and getting to 100 mph is pretty easy with the Grand Cherokee. When I go off-roading, horsepower is the least of my worries.

<b>Full-time 4WD</b>
All V8 equipped Grand Cherokees in 1994 came with the &quot;Quadra-Trac&quot; full time 4WD drivetrain. The driver can choose &quot;4WD Hi&quot; for regular driving and &quot;4WD Lo&quot; for low speed/high torque situations like off-roading. Shifting between the two modes takes a little practice, as it has to be done while the car is moving about 5 mph.

The transmission is 4 speed automatic, with Overdrive on 4th. 

<b>Too Much Luxury</b>
Although leather seats, premium CD Sound system with equalizer, and other gadgets are nice, these luxury items are not necessarily a good thing. When we take the Jeep for a wilderness trip, we rarely use the sound system as places we go don't have good radio reception, and we don't carry around CDs that often. We are always afraid to get the leather seats dirty, and cloth seats are just as comfortable, at least for me. Had my brother managed to find a less luxurious 1994 V8 Grand Cherokee for better than $16,500 at the time, I'm sure he would have bought it.

The directional compass and the gas mileage readout &quot;gadgets&quot; are actually quite nice. I used them once in a while.

<b>Interior Room</b>
The Grand Cherokee seats 4 people very comfortably, and can seat 5 (3 in the back) adequately. The cargo room in the back is average when the rear seats are not folded - two backpacks, two sleeping bags, two pairs of boots, and a tent will just fit along side the spare tire. However, when the rear seats are folded, cargo room is quite generous.
 
<b>Driving It Around</b>
My brother and I have taken the Grand Cherokee to the Mojave Desert, Death Valley, Grand Canyon in winter, Yosemite National Park all season, and various unpaved roads on mountains in the wilderness. Who knows how many other places he's taken the Jeep without me! Although we haven't done hardcore off-roading like driving up a steep grade full of boulders, we have driven on a lava bed near the Mojave Desert, which was challenging for me (but not for the Grand Cherokee), as the surface was hard &amp; rough. We've also driven through small canyons, creeks, and streams, without a sweat.

The Grand Cherokee handles quite nicely on pavement as well, with minimum body roll on turns. In fact, I can drive it through turns as fast as most cars on the road. The steering ratio is a bit too high for my taste, so I do have to turn the wheel a lot when I turn. For people who aren't used to torquey engines, the Grand Cherokee will literally jump on the throttle, requiring the driver to be smooth &amp; gentle with the accelerator pedal. Gas mileage is pretty bad, at 15-16 mpg for commute driving. The best I've managed is 18 mpg for about 200 miles on relatively flat roads - I pulled all the tricks (no A/C, windows closed, antenna down, 65 mph or slower, no cruise control, drove extra smooth).

<b>Summary</b>
The Grand Cherokee is still running fine, even after 120,000 miles on the odometer. My brother has been using it for what it was designed to do, with emphasis of <b>S</b> in SUV. We are looking forward to more years enjoying the wilderness with the Grand Cherokee. <br><br>
