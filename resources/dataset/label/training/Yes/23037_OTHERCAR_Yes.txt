              I wanted to get a digital camera that I would be able to use all the time and transfer the pictures to email fairly easy.
  I bought one Christmas 2 years ago and have not to this day ever learned to use it.  So I bought the Barbie Digital Camera.  Thinking if a child could use it surely I could too.  Well, unfortunatly I could never get the pictures from the program to the email. 
  I decided that after hearing great things and seeing wonderful pictures from my friend (from her PDC-640)  They were great and she had an easy time learning to use and installing is the easiest in my opinion.
  I spent 4 hours working with this today and now that I know how to use it I can not leave it alone.  I have taken so many pictures today and sent so many attachments to friends and family.
  With 3 young children its very nice to be able to send pictures out so easily.  My father loves to see pictures of his grand kids as he doesn't get to see them often and my brother only gets to see my kids once a year and its only for a brief time on our visits.  As he is in the Navy based in California and we live in NC.  So this is the only way he can see them except for the regular 35 mm pictures we send to him.  But this is so much faster and he can see all sorts of pictures as often as I take and send them.
  This is the best and most user friendly camera I have ever seen.  And I would recommend this one to anyone. There are other great ones I am sure but they are very expensive but for the money you get terrific value and great pictures.
