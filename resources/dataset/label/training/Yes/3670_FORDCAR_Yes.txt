            I have been using a  1992 Crown Victoria as my work vehicle for the last 8 years. It had 96,000 miles plus when it was replaced on December 6, 1999 with a 2000 Crown Victoria. I asked the purchasing department for a new Crown Victoria because I had received such excellent service and product reliability with the 1992. The new vehicle has that excellent ride that I associate with a Crown Victoria and it handles very well. The new lines of the 2000 Crown Victoria are a little more boxier than the 1992 but I am getting used to it. The tape player and radio give excellent quality sound and the interior looks nice. This is a great vehicle to take long trips in, as it has a smooth ride, it is a little heavier than the average medium priced vehicle. Someone who travels a lot and spends time on the road would do well to purchase this vehicle. I haven't had time to evaluate its economy on gas, but if it is like the 1992 it will get about 24 miles per gallon on the highway and 16 to 18 around town. <br><br>
