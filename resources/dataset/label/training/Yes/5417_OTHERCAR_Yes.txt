            I consider myself the digital camera expert. I've owned them all. Sony, Kodak, Olympus... to name a few.  The reason I recommend the Canon A5 is because of its size and image quality. It's the smallest digital camera out there. The 1.5 mega-pixel resolution is perfect for all around picture taking.  Keep in mind, when printing, the type of printer you use is just as important, (see my review on the Epson Stylus 900). When I print pictures taken from my Canon A5, you have to look real close to tell it's not a professionally developed picture. The one drawback is it takes a real odd-ball battery and it doesn't last very long, especially when using the LCD display.  The viewfinder is one of the largest I've seen. All around great camera and to top it off... affordable.<br><br>
