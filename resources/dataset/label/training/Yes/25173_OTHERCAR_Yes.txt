            I just leased the Mazda Protege 2000 a little over a month ago. First of all, I want to point out that I was the first in my immediate and extended family to purchase a 2000 vehicle. That's important to mention. Next, I need to point out that my vehicle of choice (aside from a Lexus) was the Mazda 626 or even the Mazda Millenia, but my credit wasn't good enough for either of those. (which is just as well, since I quit my job 2 weeks ago and my poor husband is reluctantly supporting me).

 Anyway, back to the car. I really like it. It's cute, sporty, easy to handle, a touch of luxury with the interior, all the accoutrements(did I spell that right?) like a CD player, air, power stuff, and a real nice paint job.  I'm truly enjoying the &quot;smallness&quot; of the car, its ease of handling, and, once again, impressed with Mazda. I do prefer the luxury of the 626, but if one needs a less expensive vehicle, you could do a lot worse than this one. Even my teenage daughter's friends have commented to her that my car &quot;looks cool&quot;. 

 The only drawback I've noticed is it's a little LOUD. Yes, compared with the more expensive ($20,000 and up) vehicles, this one is a lot noisier inside. Mazda needs to work on this. If they fixed this, the Protege would be a true contender for small, cheap, car of the year. ptp<br><br>
