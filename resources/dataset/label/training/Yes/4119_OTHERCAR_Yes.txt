            My husband and I bought our pathfinder because we were expecting our second child.  We needed more room.  We wanted something dependable, and also be able to retain it's value. Comfort was also a big deciding factor.  

The thing we like MOST is that it is a safe, fun driving vehicle.  We live in a small northern community, where we experience harsh winters and rough road conditions.  Which is not a concern for us now that we have a Pathfinder. We also like the luxury and comforts that it provides inside the cab. 

The thing we DISLIKE the most is probably the gas mileage.  The best we ever reached was 24 miles per gallon.  The worst we ever experienced was 16 miles per gallon.  With rising gas prices this should definitely be a factor in a purchase decision.

From a short persons perspective, I especially enjoy being able to have a clear view of my surroundings when driving.  We found this vehicle to be the best for road visibility. It also boasts a higher back seat, enabling the passengers in the rear to have a much clearer view of the road.  Some of the other vehicles we tested were &quot;Jeep Grand Cherokee&quot;, &quot;Toyota 4 Runner&quot;, and &quot;Honda CRV&quot;.  With the Jeep , we found it a rough ride, and not as a comfortable interior.  The 4-Runner had poor road visibility, seemed like it's interior space was smaller.  And lastly, the CRV had a lot of road noise, and again did not offer a very luxurious interior.

I would suggest a family with more than 2 children strongly go to a larger vehicle.  But for anybody else, it is definitely the top choice vehicle. <br><br>
