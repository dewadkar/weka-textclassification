            When I first went to test-drive an Xterra, I had pretty low expectations. I knew that this SUV had been built on the structure of the Nissan Frontier (with body styling influences from Land Rover) and I knew that trucks are not typically the most comfortable ride. I also expected it to be somewhat like the Pathfinder, Xterra's big brother, which I had previously test driven and found to be stiff and bumpy. I was happy to find that the Xterra has a very smooth ride.

Opting for the SE Supercharged package gets you a lot more car. 3.3L 210 horsepower 246lb-ft of torque, compared to the 170hp 200lb-ft V6 engine, or the 4-cyl 2.4L with 154lb-ft. In addition to more speed and power, you get 17" charcoal color aluminum alloy wheels as well as styling changes inside and out. The cons of this package include increased weight (4,175lbs) and decreased gas mileage (15/19mpg). Completely worth it in my opinion.

The Xterra was designed for outdoorsy people, with a signature roof rack standard on all models and other telltale signs that this SUV is for the rough and rugged. For those of us that don't fit these characteristics, once in a while one of the features will get in the way. For example, the "Loadwarrior Basket" has to be removed before you can really use the sunroof, and that's sort of a hassle. In case you're wondering about that funny little square bump on the back...it's a built-in first aid kit. Shift on the fly allows you to switch from 4x2 to 4x4 mid-expedition.

One of my favorite things about the Xterra is the sound system. It has a 6CD in-dash changer, powerful Rockford/Fosgate amp, 8 speakers, 210 watt, AM/FM radio with 18 presets, and steering wheel mounted audio controls. This has to be the perfect system...earthquake-inducing bass, very low distortion, plenty loud, convenient steering wheel controls, and no messing with a trunk changer; you feed CDs into the dash mount like putting quarters into a pop machine.

The interior is dark, dramatic, and absolutely beautiful. Leather seats aren't even offered (in keeping with the no-nonsense, anti-luxury car attitude) but with the SE SC upgrade you can get charcoal (black with light blue specks) cloth seats. The titanium accents are really nice; the cheap plasticky look of the accents in other models gives you one more reason to upgrade. Extremely comfortable black leather-wrapped steering wheel and transmission knob, and the tinted windows in back, all add to the somewhat dreary, sophisticated ambiance.

New feature for 2002: a re-designed face. Instead of blah rectangle-shaped headlights, these have adorable VW Bug-style ones, like one of its competitors, the 2002 Jeep Liberty. I guess they're supposed to make the car look more aggressive or something, but I think they're cute. Xterras also have a new "power-bulge" hood, and more exterior colors to choose from.

Perhaps the most important decision you'll have to make when buying an Xterra is color. I went for the yellow; my favorites are solar yellow and the limited availability new-for-this-year shock blue. If you're not really into bright colors, I suggest cloud white or silver ice. Gold rush is sort of pretty too, especially in sunlight, but the other colors are kinda ugly. In interior fabric you choose between gray celadon and sage, or supercharge it and get charcoal (SE models only).

I suggest this car for people that need a serious, no-frills sport-ute, or people like me who just want a really cute car to drive.
