            	Two years ago I turned sixteen and my dad decided to give me his old 96 Avenger while he bought a new car for himself. I didn't complain then, and I'm not complaining now. The car is beautiful and sophisticated, a great deal of my friends have congratulated me on getting such a &quot;high-priced, luxury car.&quot; The car gives me a smooth ride whether I'm driving on an interstate or an old dusty road. The car makes little noise, partly because of the decent sound system that comes with it right off the lot. The inside of the car is roomy and comfortable. The seats and steering wheel tend to get very hot in the sun when the car is off, luckily you have a powerful air conditioning system that handles that problem quickly. 
	However, with all the luxury it has some great performance as well, although it looks faster than it is. The V6 engine gives you decent acceleration. I've used it in a few car races and it has performed fairly well. One caution though, don't let the speedometer fool you, while it says you can obtain top speed in the 130's, I've never been able to get it above 115. The gas mileage is pretty good for that power, I get about 20 mpg on average.
	The car now has 40,000 miles on it and the engine still runs great. The only work its needed is a change in brake pads and a wheel realignment; an occasional oil change and tire rotation should keep it running smoothly.
	There are two pet peeves I have with the car. Its maximum turning ability is limited, so it can be difficult to park it in a crowded parking lot or make a good U-turn. The other is the low front bumper. If your not careful, you will scrap the front coming off a steep hill or going into the stopper in a parking space.
	The recommend this car for anyone who wants a &quot;cool&quot; car but doesn't want to pay a big price. Also, its great for anyone who likes an overall vehicle. I wouldn't suggest it for anyone who is looking for a family car, or who travels a great deal as today's gas prices can make those trips very expensive. Finally, parents don't give it to your kids for their first car and be surprised when they get a speeding ticket:)<br><br>
