            The Passport first grabbed my eye with its good looks. After a test drive I was convinced that this was the SUV for me. It packs a strong engine which provides plently of power for passing/merging on the highway. It handles great at all speeds and has rather comfortable leather seats for those long drives.

It lacked a few features that I really would have liked, such as climate control, body side moulding, and a cargo mat in the trunk. But it defintiely doesn't sacrifice performance.

Rough road/terrain is where this truck really excels. Though the ride may be bumpy because of the stiff suspension, I feel totally in control at all times. You can feel the road surface through the power-assisted steering, and the on-the-fly Power/Winter and 4WD buttons allow you to adapt to new road conditions in seconds.

I've had the misfortune of blowing out 2 rear tires at highway speeds (on separate occasions) and both times never experienced a loss of control. The blowouts were caused by debris (bolts from a construction site).

It's been a real pleasure to drive, and I always hear compliments on its appearance, fast acceleration, and comfortable interior from my friends.

It the year and a half I've owned this car I have already driven 42000 miles with the only repair required being a jammed ignition shift-lock. This one is probably a keeper for me.<br><br>
