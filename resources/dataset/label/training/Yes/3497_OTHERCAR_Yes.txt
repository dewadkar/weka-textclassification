            The Mercedes-Benz E320 is by far the absolute best value of any MB. This car is beautifully detailed for the $42,000 price. As long as I have owned this car I have only had one complaint. I have broken it down below into sections enjoy!

PROS:

Handling- The handling on the E320 is excellent for the price of the car. This Benz has tight cornering and a low center of gravity which allows for safer corner's at higher speeds. The wheel also reacts nicely.

Engine- The V6 in this car is absolutely flawless. It provides beautiful acceleration and cruising speeds. There is absolutely no need to upgrade to the V8 version (E420 or the newer E430). The engine has large cylinder heads. The engine is terrific, no complaints.

Interior- The interior ergonomic's are also very nicely set up. It is very classic while having innovative features. Everything is directly where you reach for it so you can keep your eyes on the road. The leather on the seats is soft and comfortable. In any seat there is leg room. The trunk has more than enough room for a 3 - 4 person family.

Exterior- On any MB car the paint job is absolutely beautiful. Any color shines when washed and keeps the new look. The exterior is very classic and stands out, not sticks out. 

Value- I can't stress this enough. This is a excellent value. Make a comparison with any car in its class.

CONS:

Maintanence price- I am cheap. I do not like paying $500 per scheduled maintanence. It is very high as with any foreign car (Volvo and Jaguar is worse i must add). 

Windshield Wiper- I love the single washer except in heavy rain. It takes longer to wipe the full windshield than two does.

Overall this is a unbelievable value. You will recieve quality and performance in one package. This car is perfect for anyone (30 to 80) seaching for a luxury car with value and performance fused together. Definately consider this car if you are in the market!<br><br>
