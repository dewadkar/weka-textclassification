            My mom owns a 1995 Toyota Camry and I love it.  At first we didn't want a Camry, but instead wanted a Rav4.  It turned out that we couldn't afford it so my mom was looking at used toyotas and we found a used Camry.  It is probably the best car my mom has ever owned.  Good gas mileage, quiet, good looks and comfortable.  My mom was actually in a wreck the other day...2/09/00...scary, but she was okay.  There was four cars involved and my mom was the first to be hit at 60 MPH.  SHe was stopped on the freeway ans the guy slammed in to her, and her into the guy in front of her and then him into the guy in front of him.  The only damaged part of the car was the bumper, which cracked and was bent a little.  So I definetly recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
