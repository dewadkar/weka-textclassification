            With the new Suburban out by GMC, you can now take your entire family along with you when you go on vacation.  I personally own a Suburban, and with all of it's features like rear and middle A/C, plus rear control of heat and air control the passengers feel like they are in the front seat.  There is enough leg room for the passengers in the back, even if you are a large man.  The third seat in the back can easily hold three people, and if it is not in use, then you can simply take it out for more storage space.  Even with the third seat in there is plenty of room for your packages or boxes.
The down side to this extremely large vehicle is the inability to find adequate parking, but in the end, a vehicle that is not only safe, but roomy,is worth the price and the double parking.<br><br>
