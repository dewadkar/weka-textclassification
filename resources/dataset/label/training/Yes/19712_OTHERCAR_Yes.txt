            We leased a new 1999 Saturn Station Wagon in June of 1999.  We needed a dependable family car to replace my old lemon.  Having one child at the time, we really thought little about the space factor.  It soon became apparent that the amount of space in our car was sparse.  There is very little leg room for the average sized adult, even in the front seats.  If we take it on a road trip of just 100 miles, the driver's legs get cramped.  The seats are also extremely low.  
Besides the space factor, this car is a dream!  It is very practically priced, and we have had no problems with it ever.  It fits into all parking spots, drives great, and is a fun little car.  
I recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for a fun, dependable car for commuting and such.  The gas mileage is great.  As for a family station wagon, this car is not.  Also, anyone who is quite tall may not enjoy this car.<br><br>
