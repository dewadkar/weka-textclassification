            I always considered myself a Volvo man. But when the new Volvo S80 came out, I didn't like its looks. It looked like the Volvo designers didn't make up their minds about how this car should look. It looked to me like a half-cooked design. I was told it was the best Volvo ever, but you have to LOVE your car, and I didn't love this one.
Audi A6 seemed better designed. So was BMW 330, But I still looked for my dream car.
One day a friend took me on an inter-city drive in his 95 Buick Le Sabre. I was tired, so I put the seat down and slept all the way. Boy, was it a luxurious sleep. I woke up feeling so refreshed, not cramped like sleeping in other cars. This was the beginning of my love affair.
When I began talking to my friends about owning a Le Sabre, they sneered. "Get an S80 or an A6" they said. "Or a Mercedes. But BUICK???"
I nearly gave in to peer pressure. My wife also discouraged me. She wanted me to buy a Volvo. But I was in LOVE with the Buick. 
So after much procrastinating I went to the showroom and signed the order, spellbound.
I Knew in advance it would have to be a dark blue one. The most noble color.
When it arrived, everything changed.
Everybody around me was astounded.
The space, the power, the luxury, the riding on air, the deat quiet coasting, the ironing out of road bumps, the take-off of the accelerator, are superb. The quick, responsive maneuverability, uncanny for a car this size, surprised me.
I don't understand all these car critics who sing the praises of hard suspension for better maneuverability. most of us folks are not racing drivers. We want to ride in comfort, not take bends at 120 MPH. 
On the weekend I had to do some work. My family wanted to go to visit friends in another town. So with reluctance I gave the keys to my wife.
When i phoned them to hear how they were, they were electrified with enthusiasm. "We never wanted this ride to end" she and the kids told me with glee. "We went round and round for some more of this fantastic riding feeling".
My eldest son was quick to assert: "In 18 months you're going to get yourself a new car - and leave this one for me!"
What can I say, riding in a Buick (Whether at the driver's wheel or even in the back seat) is an experience out of this world. No European or Japanese car even comes close. And I've ridden in a Merc S500 - their top of the line limo.
Le Sabre is better.
My friend who swears by his Merc and proclaims to HATE American cars had a hard time admitting: "yes, but this is something else".
This is by far the BEST car I've ever ridden in, whether mine or not.
With other cars you go to arrive at your destination. With this one you never want the journey to end.
