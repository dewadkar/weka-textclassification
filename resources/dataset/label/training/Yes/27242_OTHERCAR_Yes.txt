            In the beginning of 2/2000, I bought a new Firebird 2000. I chose the base model with the V6/200hp engine, T-top etc. I have this car now for 8 weeks and yesterday I put mile #3000 on it.. here are my impressions.
One warning upfront. I am not a technical person when it comes to cars. I am a driver and my maintenance work is limited to fill up fuel, oil, replacement of battery, twice an alternator and fuses.
No infos about the car's differential here :-)


<b>First the good:</b>

The Firebird looks and drives great (what do you expect in 8 weeks?).

In the Firebird, I can take those dangerous windy curves in the Santa Cruz mountains at 10-15 mph faster than in my old Mazda 626.

I can now get from 70 to 90mph in approximately 1.5s; never measured that in the 626.

The trunk is of ok size compared to the Miata (a car that I think looks much better than it drives).

The Firebird comes with a good 500 watt/ 10-speaker/ graphic equalizer stereo system and feels inside comfortable - almost like a Sedan. Sure more comfortable than a Camaro and a whole different world compared to the Miata.


<b>The not so great things:</b>

* when it rains while I park the car, about half a gallon of water collects on the rear spoiler.
If you open the trunk in this situation, some of the water will run inside (about a cup on each side). Enough to soak the back seat safety belts and I guess if someone would be sitting on the back seat, they'd get a free hair wash.

* the rear spoiler together with the missing back side window (it's solid non-transparent there) give you a poor view. Look at the Mitsubish 3000GT, at the Eclipse. Both have a back side window, so you see a car that is right behind you. Some Mustang models have the rear side window too (not really sure).
In the Firebird, you have the largest blind spot that I have ever &quot;seen&quot;.

* the second electric outlet is sort of blocked by the parking brake. Most adapters won't fit in there when the parking brake is released. You don't want to drive with a pulled parking brake? Me neither.
<i>My tip:</i> Radio Shack has an adapter that is sort of L-shaped and fits even if the parking brake is released. Email me for the part number if interested.

* gas mileage
according to the spec, it shall get 19 mpg in city traffic and 29 mpg on the highway. When I drive 50% city and 50% highway at a speed of 70 mph, I get 20 mpg.
Once, on a longer trip on the highway, I reached 22 mpg. That may be because I was speeding a little more, on the other hand, the street was flat, no traffic.. perfect driving conditions. I am still looking for the driving style that results in the promised 29 mpg. I think that it is impossible.

* low front end - driving into most driveways will make you hit the floor with the low front. I guess this is no surprise - the car is not on high heels. Drive into driveways with an angle.

* uneven weight distribution
The earlier mentioned curves in the Santa Cruz mountains (famous Highway 17).. on a heavy-rain day I did slide a few times at relatively low speed (45mph, following the speed limit). A friend explained me that the heavy engine causes the center of gravity to be in the front and the rear wheel drive makes control in such conditions worse.

* the shock alarm sensor is not very sensitive.
The manual says: <i>&quot;Set it to maximum sensitivity and a wind blow will set the alarm off.&quot;</i> Well, I did this but was not able to set the alarm off. I once had a neighbor with a Buick and saw her alarm go off after someone used very little power against the car.
Right in the first week of ownership, I went to the dealer, they exchanged the sensor but no improvement. I finally delivered a hard, sharp blow against the right rear (that's where the sensor is in the trunk). I stood on the sidewalk and put my full body weight in it. My friend said, I slightly lifted the car. And - the alarm did go off. Seems like you pretty much have to have an accident to trigger the shock alarm. Remember: this was the <b>most sensitive setting</b>.
The less sensitive setting can be used as an <i>earthquake sensor</i>, I guess.


<b>Conclusion:</b>

I thought that this epinion would be longer, but I just could not come up with more 'flaws'. The Firebird is good if you drive mostly on highways/ freeways, because you don't want to have it go at 25 mph through the city, right? And you'll see your gas station more often.. I get 320 miles out of 15 gallons. All in all, personally I am glad that I bought it.

<i><b>I will update this epinion over time as I learn more about the car.</b></i>
