               The Dodge Durango is a good SUV.  It is easy to get around town and you feel very safe in them.  
  I have the luxury edition and it is very comfortable riding, especially the driver and passenger seat up front.  The middle row is a little less comfortable and the third row isn't a good place for an adult to sit on for a long trip.  
  The third seat has come in handy many times.  You don't think about it, but 2 extra seats can comes in handy.  
  The sound quality is excellent but there is no middle zone for volume.  It seems like there is no middle zone, but it is ok unless you have sensitive ears.  
  Riding in this car is a pleasure.  It is extremely quiet and smooth.  Unilke many other SUVs, noise is not a factor and a conversation is easy to have.  Also, the engine in this vehicle is excellent.  The V8 really picks up quickly.  
  Gas is moderate for a sport utility.  I can get about 270 miles to a full tank.
