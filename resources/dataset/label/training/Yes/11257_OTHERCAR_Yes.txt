            I recently rented one of these swoopy mid size Dodges for a week and put on over 500 miles, and must admit that although I have never owned a Chrysler product, I would seriously consider adding one of these to my personal fleet!

The interior is reasonably well laid out, with the exception of the ash tray, but I guess that they are trying to tell me not to smoke!  The seats are comfortable and adjust to just about any driving position when combined with the tilt steering wheel.  There also appears to be good room for passengers in the back seat, although I never actually got to sit back there to check it out.  The trunk is huge.

On the highway, the car cruises quietly and smoothly.  The power initially seems good, but with only a 2.7 liter OHC V6 and a curb weight of over 3,000 pounds, the car is not really going to generate much g forces on acceleration and push you forcefully back in your seat on take off.  The car tracks straight and true, with the exception occurring on gravel roads where it has a tendency to get squirrely at higher speeds.  Braking was smooth and steady with the ABS system.  Gas mileage is in the mid to upper 20 mpg range.  The climate control works smoothly and quietly.

But no vehicle is 100% perfect and certain design flaws are built into the design.  This is one of Chrysler's cab forward designs, and the swoopy design means that for tall people the top of the windshield comes close to ones forehead.  Also the dead pedal where one rest their left food is close due to the intrusion of the front wheel well meaning that you actually have the same amount of foot room that is found in many compact cars.  The sheer bulk of the exterior make it had to park, and the blind spots where the body disappears from your line of sight makes it hard to place the car in the parking spot.  Another concern of mine is that Chrysler transmissions of late are prone to premature failure as I have heard this to be true from other owners of this model.  The aerodynamic body also makes servicing the engine very difficult, especially timing belt and accessory drive belt replacements.

But overall this is a fine, solidly built family sedan.
