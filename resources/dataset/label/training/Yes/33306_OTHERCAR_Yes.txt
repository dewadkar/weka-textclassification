            I bought the Forester because I had previously owned two other Subaru's and they both were remarkably dependable.  In addition, Subaru's tend to be just a tad unique as well -- and I like to be a tad different than the normal crowd.

I now have 45,000 miles on my '98 Forester S (manual transmission) and it is wonderful. It has only been to the shop for a minor brake recall notice .  It is truly a superb vehicle -- great AWD performance, wonderful gas mileage, adequate storage, great ABS system, and a very peppy 2.5L engine.  If you want an SUV -- but you loathe the thought of spending your hard-earned money on gas -- you need to check out the Forester.  After a test drive, I think you would agree that it bests it's nearest competitors: the Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4.

Subaru also seems to take safety very seriously.  The Forester is the only SUV out there that does not have to carry a roll-over warning.  I know, from experience, that the thing will not roll.  I was in a very, very dangerous situation on an interstate highway and put the thing into a 
complete 360.  The thing did not roll and there was NO damage to myself or the vehicle.  In my experience the 4-wheel discs and ABS (on the Forester S) work great, and the vehicle has done very well in crash tests.

UPDATE:  (01/25/01)
I now have about 65,000 miles on the Forester and it is still going great.  No expenses other than a new set of tires and oil changes.  I do need to get it in for my 60,000 mile checkup soon, but I am still running original plugs and the thing is getting 27-28 mpg.  The family (wife, daughter, and Golden Retriever) packed up during the holidays and headed to Kentucky to visit family.  We were able to fit all our luggage and Christmas presents in the car -- but it was starting to get tight.  Might have to look into buying one of those luggage bins that fit onto the luggage rack.  Also, expecting a baby boy in 5 weeks and I am starting to wish the Forester was a little larger -- but hey, I would hate to have to pay for lower gas mileage.

UPDATE:  (06/20/01)

I'm now at 80,000 miles.  I just had the timing belt changed and new plugs put in (Subaru recommends doing all this at 60,000 miles).  Other than that those maintenance items, no problems at all to report.  The little digital clock by the rear view mirror went out.  I am trying to find a replacement so I can install it myself.  Other than that, no problems. The car keeps ticking nicely.  I have added a Subaru trailer hitch which I installed myself (took little over an hour).  I really could not be happier with my decision to buy this car, and I think the changes that Subaru has made since the '98 model has improved the product even more.  Subaru also now provides a customized web site.  You enter your car's VIN number and it will inform you of needed maintenance or any recalls that you should know about.  Very thoughtful service. 

UPDATE (08/09/02)
I now have over 121,000 miles on my Forester.  A couple months ago I had to have all the front engine seals replaced and I went ahead and had all belts replaced.  This is to be expected for a car over 100,000 miles.  The total cost was about $580.00.  I still am on the original clutch -- which is amazing considering the very early '98 Foresters were considered by many to have weak clutches.  All in all this has EASILY ranked as the best vehicle I have every owned.  The interior has held up very nicely -- and we have a dog and two kids (one of which is a baby) to transport around.  The exterior is in excellent condition as well. 

UPDATE (12/10/02)
Now at 132,000 miles. Still nothing bad to report.  Amazing vehicle and, still, I am using the original clutch and it hasn't even hinted at slipping yet.

UPDATE (8/30/03)
Now at 155,000 miles.  At 140,000 I had clutch replaced - even though it wasn't really going out yet.  I just knew that I would keep this car for some time and wanted to play it safe.  A/C, brakes, everything is still in great shape. This car is super.  We now have another baby in the house and have purchased a 2003 Honda Odyssey -- but the Subaru is still my main ride for going to work, trips to store, etc.
