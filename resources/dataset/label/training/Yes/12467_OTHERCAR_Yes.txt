            The Volvo S40, although rather small, is one of the most luxurious cars I have ever owned.  My biggest pet peeve in the winter is having to commute in below freezing weather, when my car cannot produce hot air until almost ten minutes into the ride, when I already am too cold to move my joints.  Not only can the S40 almost immediately spew out warm air, it also offers a winter package (which is well worth the cost) which gives you seat warmers, and other extras.  Next winter will be much less painful with these options.

Another plus is the suspension.  The streets of DC are more potholes than actual road.  I can drive over all these spots without feeling a single bump in the S40 however.  The only other car I have driven in that is similar to the S40 is the Toyota Camry.  Although the Camry is much roomier it does not offer nearly as luxurious or smooth a ride.  I would recommend the S40 over the Camry to anyone who does not expect to have more than one passenger too frequently, and can spare the extra $4,000 to drive smoothly in extreme comfort.
