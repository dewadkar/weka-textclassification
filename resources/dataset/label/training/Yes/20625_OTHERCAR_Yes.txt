            I was looking to buy a classy affordable durable vehicle.    The Audi A4 was professional yet sporty.   I love the look and feel of driving the A4.    
The worst part of owning a 1996 A4 is the never ending brake dust.  After every drive it accumulates on the wheels.   Although after replacing the brakes in November 99, the dust was reduced, but still visible.
The A4 quattro handles extremely well on turns and high speed lane switching.    This vehicle would also be ideal for bad weather conditions.
Young or old professionals would enjoy this vehicle.  I think it is comparable to the BMW.   It is great for entertaining clients.  A small family would also enjoy this car.  The back seat would accommodate a baby seat very easily. And with the four door sedan, getting in and out would be a breeze.
Tall or very big people would not enjoy sitting in the back seat of this car.  The space is limited when the front seats are back.    <br><br>
