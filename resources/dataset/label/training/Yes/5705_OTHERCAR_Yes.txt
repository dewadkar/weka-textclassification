            The lease is up on our 1998 SE Altima. 44,000 miles later, here is the scoop from a car guy. We had another Altima in 1995 (a GXE), and traded up for a "loaded" SE. It has ABS, leather, auto & sunroof. It was $22,500
We never had any problems with the car other than the drivers sun visor falling off, but overall the car feels cheap. There are numerous squeaks and rattles that drive me nuts. The paint is faded in several spots. The leather for the seats must have come from some diseased bovine. 
The car is tremendously underpowered. Is is nerve racking just to merge on the freeway. I have to really wind the engine up to get any decent forward movement, and it shure makes noise then. The auto transmission is ALWAYS in the wrong gear at low speed around town. I end up "flooring it" to prompt a downshift, and end up jerking the passengers around and giving everyone a dose of engine noise. It's embarassing.
The seats must be on someone's torture implements list. They started out bad, and got worse over time as they settled in. There is acually a void in the seats where the lumbar suppoert should be.
Even with the SE package the car did not handle well, it did not handle bad - but certainly not sporty as the nameplated suggests.
Overall, I was more pleased with our first '95 GXE more than this one, probably because it had no "sporting" aspirations. I think with all the options, I made a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
Not to leave on a negative note (remember, we had NO mechanical failures or unscheduled service stops during it's tenure) Nissan dealers write some great deals! The '98 was 0 down, $279/mo, 12k mi./yr. and they took back the lease on the first '95 with body damage, and needing tires.

We looked at another Altima, and the G20, but passed and got a loaded VW Jetta GLX instead.

The Altima is a really good vanilla-flavored appliance.
