            I had a 1994 Oldsmobile Bravada which I liked, but my wife hated because of its rough ride.  My only problem with the Bravada was that there was not enough room to haul large paintings.  I started searching for something with a larger freight area, and a smooth ride, and found the 1998 Oldsmobile Silhouette, which I purchased about 18 months ago.  I've already put over 28,000 miles on the car (or I should say my wife and I have, as she usually drives it and leaves me with what was her &quot;smooth riding&quot; sedan).  It has good gasoline economy, the seats go in and out easily for freight or passengers, and it's one of the smoothest riding vehicles I've ever driven.  I intend to buy another just like it whenever this one wears out (which I hope is never). <br><br>
