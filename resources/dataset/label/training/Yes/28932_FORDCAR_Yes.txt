I used to be very skeptical of SUVs because I drove a pickup and figured if you were going to drive a truck then drive a TRUCK. But I rented a 2000 Ford Explorer automatic over spring break and it changed my opinions.  It was a very smooth ride on the highway, town road, and even on the beach at daytona.  Suprisingly it also had a lot of room inside opposed to some crappy SUVs like the Xterra. I fit my surfboard, two skateboards, two wetsuits, beach towels and tree suitcases in the back with room to open up the back door and lounge at the beach. After driving to daytona we drove all the way to Boca Raton and it was a great drive. Nice and quiet, and even in traffic it handled really well. As far as acessories go it was great. CD player, lots of interior and EXTERIOR lighting!

The only problems i found were it was a little sketchy on tight turns on streets but nothing really worrysome.  (We had to drive it accross the median of a highway because of an accident and it drove just fine then!!!)
