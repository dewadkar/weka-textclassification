            In 1999, I test drove several cars until I finally decided to buy an Acura Integra GSR (frost white). I considered the Eclipse GS, Volkswagen GTI, Mazda Miata but ended up with the Integra.

The purchase price was $19,090 excluding taxes and fees.

Likes:
Plenty of power for the pint size 1.8 engine.
Comfortable seats.
Sleek cockpit design.
Plenty of aftermarket parts.
Fully loaded.
Affordable.

Dislikes:
Not fuel efficient at all if driving at above 4400 rpm.
Not enough bass with the stock cd stereo system. 
Cd player is very basic.
Stock tires are not good at all (poor wet traction).
Expensive to insure.
Nobody want to sit in the backseats.
The power windows seems to be slower than other cars.

If you go vtec and accelerate fast, it easy to notice your fuel gauge notches down a bit. I presume fuel economy may be cut in half in the mid to upper rpm range. I love the 8K redline. The engine temp doesn't even move up a bit when I spend some time in the upper rpm range.  This car's powerband begins at the rpm where most other car ends. The only thing is though your gear selection is critical to rocket the car around, especially on the streets.
Someone should not buy this car if they are not willing to spin the engine. Shifting early or shifting for &quot;economy&quot; will make the Integra GSR feel like most other &quot;econobox&quot; cars. The vtec has to be kicked in to get some life out the little beast.
As stock, the car is quite awesome. Unless you are an enthusiast, you should be happy with the car out of the box.
The overall design of the car is a bit conservative in my opinion. The spoiler certainly adds some style to it. Also, consider clear corner lamps...I really think it improves the car's front view. <br><br>
