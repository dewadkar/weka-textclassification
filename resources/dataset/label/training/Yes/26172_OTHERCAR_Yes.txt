            This review is all about attitude.  If you're looking to buy a Lincoln Mark VII you can get all the tech specs and cold, hard numbers you want on this car.  But screw that....what you really want to hear about is what this car is all about.  Attitude, baby!

The Lincoln Mark VII LSC makes no apologies for what it is.  Politically correct, minivan driving, Starbucks swilling yuppies be damned....this car thumbs its nose at everything held precious by today's soccer moms and dot.com dads.  It's a relic of Reaganomics.  A standing tall, shining city on a hill, All Amurrican kind of vehicle.  Viewed from head-on with its front wheels turned to a rakish angle, it looks you right in the eye and says, &quot;If you don't like it, then stick it up your tailpipe!&quot;  And, like the outspoken governor of Minnesota, it has the muscle to go with the attitude.

Gawd, I love this car!

I've loved this car since it first hit the streets in 1984.  For the next few years I could only dream of owning one, but today I can look back and count four that I've owned, including two currently.  In its first two model years, the Mark's makers put more emphasis on luxury and leather than sportiness.  But beginning in 1986, with the LSC sport coupe leading the way, the Mark VII found its groove with a pumped up 5.0 liter V8 (same as the Mustang GT), improved suspension and steering, dual exhaust, performance rear end, etc., etc., etc.

Ford kept pouring on the power until the &quot;VII&quot; was replaced with the &quot;VIII&quot; in 1993 and the end of an era for those of us who believe this to be the best looking luxury coupe ever produced.  For the lead-footed folks, the pinnacle of Mark VII attitude was the SE model, a sinister looking, nearly chrome free version of the LSC series.  It came in black or red, but black was the color of choice for this brute in velvet gloves.

The Mark VII was also a test bed for Ford's leading technology of the eighties.  As a result, the cockpit is chock full of buttons, lights, buzzers and chimes.  The car rides on four air bags instead of coil springs and uses a unique German made anti-lock brake system.  Features like these promote a love/hate relationship with current owners who must get down in the technical trenches or shell out big bucks for repairs.  Most owners, however, would agree that the Mark VII is very reliable - even when rolling through the second hundred thousand miles - but when things do break, they're expensive.

The upside to all this is that the cars are relatively cheap to buy.  But if you do, consider the purchase price as a down payment and go into it knowing you will have to cough up more down the road.  But don't let it scare you away, my Marks have delivered many thousands of low cost miles to me over the years.  Besides, if you would actually consider buying a Camry or some other faceless, econo-clone.....man, you're in the wrong place!

So get behind the wheel of an LSC and.........hey, whaddayou lookin at!??
