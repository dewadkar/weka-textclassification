            Seeing that I came out of college a few months ago, I have been looking for almost a year in anticipation of purchasing my first car. My family comes from a background of import car buyers, mainly because of the resale value and quality we have experienced with them.

My sister owned a 98 Eclipse and I was looking for the same, but realized over time that not only are they tough to come across that generation, but the resale on them is higher than she paid. So, I looked around at a variety of cars in the sports market.

I was a bit skeptical at looking at the less attractive newer generation and it did not look like as good a ride as the curvy model my sister owned. So, my first choices were to check out the <b>Toyota Celica and Acura RSX</b> mainly because of recommendations of friends and family. After visiting those dealerships and realizing the pricing, I decided to look at other manufacturers that offered incentives for new cars.

<b>Mitsubishi is offering two decent financing plans</b>
- 0 down, 0% for a year, and 0 payments for a year
- 0 down, 0% for 60 months

This was enticing, so I decided to test drive an Eclipse at the local dealership. <b>After driving the Celica and RSX, I was much more comfortable driving the Eclipse.</b> Once figuring out the options and packages, I ended up buying it a few days later.

<b>Exterior</b>

Originally, this generation of Eclipse seemed like it was missing something, an incomplete look. The 2003 models now have new Euro-lights instead of large red covers, the emblems are chrome instead of red, the front now has more metal to surround the fog lights, and overall the design is very slick. When given a chance for colors, you have two shades of gray, two of red, two of blue, white and black. That alone is great, considering I got the Titanium (dark gray) that matches the taillights and chrome emblems perfectly.

The trunk opens up nice and large, but for small people it could be a pain to close it at times. The trunk does not open by the remote keyless entry, which could also be a small nuisance. The gas tank just opens up without any buttons or special switches, and for $200 you can have that gas cap in aluminum, but unless you buy a silver car, it seems pointless.

<b>Interior</b>

The inside of the car is wonderfully laid out. All gauges and warning lights sit comfortably on the dash, and are easy to read (the Celica, for some reason, used tough to read italic type). Temperature controls are within reach and the stereo is easy to use as well. The top center of the console has your clock as well as your stereo display, meaning that you don't have to look down while switching stations/cd tracks. My car was equipped with a premium stereo and had radio controls on the steering wheel, making it <i>much</i> easier to drive and keep my eyes on the road.

Visually the interior has two options. A sandy beige or a dark blue/black "midnight" mix. Both look nice whether you have leather or cloth, and the design overall on the interior matches and feels complete. Most import cars tend to look cheap and plasticy all over the inside (Honda is the worst at it), so it feels like luxury almost.

<b>Comfort</b>

I am 6'3" and still wonder at times why I bought a small sports car. But, for its purpose (single male commuting to work), it fits the bill. As long as the driver's seat is pulled back, anyone around my height should fit just fine. Of course, though, this also means driving two other passengers is probably the limit you'll get unless there are kids in the back. The seats are deep and comfortable buckets, and wrap slightly. Manual back, seat, and tilt adjustments come on the front seats.

As mentioned before, the console and controls are all within reach and sensible. Turn a knob, push a button, it's all there. This in essence makes concentration on the road easy. While it is nice, you might have to concentrate a bit when lane changing. Looking out the left 3/4 blind spot is tough, but the right side is much more forgiving. <i>The Celica was much worse in this respect, and the RSX was pretty much similar</i>.

Getting in and out of the car is a little tough for larger people, as most cars are in this respect. The low stance on the ground is something to get used to, but not that much of a problem.

<b>The Ride</b>

The ride is smooth and comfortable, with the occassional jitters on rough surface. I was actually surprised to not feel that much bounce over some railroad tracks. Brakes handle well, turns fine under normal speeds, less stiff than other cars I test drove. It was, to say the least, fun to drive and fairly nimble.

Out of the Eclipse, Celica, and RSX, the Eclipse is the only offering a v6 engine. And the V6 pushes fast and smooth, while the Celica and RSX upset me with the little 4-cylinder. The Eclipse RS and GS models have a 4-cylinder as well, but I did not test drive them. Regardless, the V6 was worth the extra money.

<b>Model Breakdown</b>

RS - Base model, very few options available, 15" wheels, 4-cylinder, starting around $18k
GS - Base model with more options/luxuries like power and spoiler, 16" wheels, 4-cylinder, starting around $20k
GT - Sport model with better interior, 17" wheels, many options available, v6 engine, starting around $22k
GTS - GT model with side airbags, ABS brakes, lots of luxuries, around $24k

If you want a V6 automatic, you get a Sporttronic transmission, which lets you have the option to switch gears without a clutch. You can also drive it as a straight automatic as well.

<b>Packages</b>

Major Option - Leather for GS/GT
Sun and Sound - sunroof and premium stereo for GS/GT
Sun, Sound, and Leather - the above with leather interior for GT

<b>Final word</b>

I made the initial mistake of passing over this car while looking at import sports cars. The value you get for this car, especially with financing options available, makes me wonder why people pass up on this over a Celica or RSX. The performance is there, the interior is excellent in many respects, and it's just a fun car to drive.

<b>UPDATE: 1 month, 1,000 miles</b>

Since cars can easily change over the course of a month and after the new car smell fades away, here's a few updates on my car:
- The trunk with folding back seats made quite a bit more room than expected when loading my car with many holiday shopping bags. I managed to easily fit a golf bag and other items in it.
- The GTS is the only model with a rear windshield wiper, and should be considered a little more because of visibility issues you may have. Also, using Rain-X will help that issue (Rain-X helps bead rain on windows)
- The door is quite large and may be tough for you to get out comfortably in tight parking spots. But, it isn't really that big of a matter.

<b>UPDATE: 2 months, 1,800 miles</b>

My front bumper was scratched up because someone backed into my car at a traffic light (???), and I found out a few details about repairs. Although my front bumper stayed intact, repairs aren't cheap for it. The reason why is because in order to remove the bumper, the headlights need to be taken out. The repairman said it's generally a pain in the butt.

Also, I've started looking for car mods and aftermarket items for the 2003 Eclipse, but they aren't as easy to find as you'd expect. Since slight modifications to the model have been made since the 2002 model, some parts are not available or might require a little extra work. Over time this will not be a problem, but it could stall any work you might plan to do on it. Check out www.neweclipse.org for more information about car modification for the 3rd generation Eclipse.

<b>UPDATE: 10 months, 12,500 miles</b>

The car is still running smooth, took it on a road trip from Chicago to Toronto (~9 hours) and it ran fine the whole way while I only stopped for gas and a drive-thru stop.

I'm still looking for decent aftermarket parts, but they're only slowly progressing for the 03 models (namely lighting and body kits).
