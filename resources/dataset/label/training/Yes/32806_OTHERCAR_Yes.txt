            NOTE: You know, some people have asked me through e-mail whether I really am the way I am in my reviews, dry-witty, somber, calculating. So I decided that I would plunk down and, in one big swoop, hammer out my customary two-and-a-half pages in exactly the manner I talk and interact with people on a daily basis. This may be a trifle off-putting, a touch trepidational for some. But for those of you willing to brave the unadulterated brunt of my personality-kind of like what that guy in the tiny spaceship in <i>Innerspace</i> would see if he was tossed into a lava lamp-my blessings. The rest of you puke-puddles have been warned. 

I have, in my twenty-two years, been struck by five cars, I think.

That�s the funny thing about being struck by a car. You remember absolutely everything-the sensation of flight, how many skeeters were in the air(I had time my fifth time, since such things happen in slo-mo, to count every single one. There were thirty-six. Even had time to name them. Getting hit by a car, after all, has that kind of John Woo-action movie slo-mo, where you can have your life flash before your eyes, rewind it, watch it again, stuff it under your bed, forget it for thirty years, come across it when you�re fifty and evacuating the dust bunnies, and watch it again)-save that one minor detail: the car. 

You assume you�d remember something like that. 

It seems kind of important. 

You don�t, though.

When Hiroshima survivors are interviewed, and the interviewer asks,� What would you say is the most horrific event in your life?�, they straightaway answer,� The bomb.� There�s no scratching of head or furrowing of brow in a vain effort to jostle free that lodged bit of datum from their foggy gray cells. They know it instantly: a bomb! They even know what kind of bomb, an atomic bomb. They even know what direction it came from: up. They can tell you what it sounded like: a bomb. For contrast, they can tell you what it didn�t sound like: a whisper-quiet dishwasher. They can tell you what color was the explosion: explosion-colored. And for contrast, what it was not colored like: Snuggles the fabric softener bear. They can describe the size of the explosion: a big one. They can even tell you who was driving the bomb: some nut whooping his head off and waving a ten-gallon cowboy hat. 

Not so with people who have been hit by cars.

For all I know I was hit by the Scooby-do Mystery Machine, or Babe the Blue Ox, or Aquaman�s Aquamarine Aquamobile (Although it�s pretty far-fetched that it was that last one, as he�s not allowed to drive it on land without a permit, which he doesn�t have, which I know because he told me, when he hit me, when I was underwater, at Myrtle Beach, twenty feet under, peeing, that deep so nobody would see the cloud, just the bubbles, which they would assume are from mermaid flatulence. That was number four.)

Did it hurt?

Heck yes, it hurt. 

It sort of felt like how the Wicked Witch of the East felt, just after the house fell on her. Or that guy in <i>Jason and the Argonauts</i>. The one who ran like a girl and got crushed by the terra-cotta titan (But he deserved it. Because the Argonauts were from Athens, which is in Greece. You know, the country next to the country that gave us stuffed-crust pizza and John Lequizamo. Bless and curse their hides. And people in Greece back then were very boring people, who had nothing to but have races and pour oil all over their perfectly-sculpted bodies. They tried to combine the two pastimes, but spectators kept getting blinded by all of the oil flying off of the perfectly-formed bodies of the runners, who were naked, running. Anyway, if the guy ran like a girl, he obviously wasn�t from Athens. He was a spy. And he came to the end that all spies come to: trampled underfoot by a terracotta titan. That�s how they got rid of Harriet the Spy, and that annoying Rosie O�Donnell.)

Does it really feel that bad?

Nope, you persistent, pestiferous pesterer. 

Worse.

Remember the old silents? The ones where the blackhat with the twirly moustache ties the girl to the tracks, and the locomotive is bearing down on her and everything? Remember that? Well, imagine that the hero with the white badge and the white chaps goes to save her, but it turns out that before the bad guy was a bad guy, he was a Boy Scout, and knows how to tie a Granny Knot, into a Turkshead, into a loop-de-loop, then mingled it back through all the other knots, and into a sneaker knot as a final, diabolical touch, the kind of twenty-knot sneaker knots that fourth-graders do. And imagine the good guy with the white badge and the white chaps, before he became GGWTWBATWC, was a badminton player, and knows nothing about knots. So GGWTWBATWC doesn�t untie her in time, and she gets hit by that grilled knife thingamuhjigger on the front of the train. You know, that thing that looks from up above like a gridiron goatee, but from head-on doesn�t look anything at all, except maybe certain death, as nobody is going to be stupid enough to stand in the way long enough to get a good enough peeperful to be able to describe it metaphorically. But imagine the lady is hit, and is diced into as many pieces as there are blades on the grilled knife thingummy on the front, and her inner juices splattered like that kid in <i>Maximum Overdrive</i> who gets run over by a steam roller (And they don�t show it. But the clip made George Romero bison.)

Imagine all of that, concentrated into a sensation of pain, amplify it a thousand times, run it through the washer so it shrinks a bit, bicycle pump it up a bit more, shrink it with the shrinking machine from <i>Honey I Shrunk the Kids</i> all the way down to cell size, imagine that cell-sized pain in every cell of your body and you might come close.

Now you�re shaking your head. You say,� Nothing could hurt that bad. And you must remember at least one of the vehicles that hit you.�

Wrong on both accounts. Yes, it does hurt that bad. And, yes, I don�t remember at least one of the vehicles. 

I remember two.

Remember the Aquaman�s Aquamarine Aquamobile?

The other was a <b>2002 Nissan Pathfinder LE 3.5L 4-Door Sport Utility</b>.

I�m not sure whether it�s left its mark on the market, but it certainly has on me (Just below my last floating rib on the left, the big blotch that looks like the Joker�s face in <i>Batman</i>, after Basinger splashes the pitcher of water on him in the museum.)

The Pathfinder has many wonderful features, which I had plenty of time to enjoy or admire as the panicked teenage driver who clobbered me sped me to the emergency room. Stuff like: Alloy Wheels, Air Conditioning, Cassette Player, Climate Control, Compact Disc Player, Cruise Control, Cup Holders, Fog Lamps, Folding Rear Seat, Full-Size Spare, Heated Side Mirrors, Keyless Remote Entry, Luggage Rack, Power Door Locks, Power Mirrors, Power Windows, Rear Defogger, Rear Wiper, Sunroof, Tachometer, Theft Deterrent System, Tilt Steering Wheel, Tinted Glass 

The cup holders were particularly handy, as they were large enough to fit both my kidneys and my gall bladder, which had been knocked free during the accident, and would have to be surgically reattached.

The rear defogger kept the rear window crystalline clear, despite the anger steam tea kettle spouting from my ears at the absolute aggravation I was feeling towards this moron who had just struck me, which kept re-clouding the window. 

The cruise control left the kid�s feet free, so he could kick my liver back into place and deflect my frenzied attack on him with the one operational appendage I possessed: my tongue (Which I exercise daily by licking my way to the center of a whole package of Tootsie Roll Pops.)

The cassette player had an awesome decibel level, as the kid was playing (Imagine this?) �Children of the Revolution�, top-volume to drown out my strident shrieks of agony.

And the fog lamps actually peered through thirty feet of water after the kid barreled off a bridge when I grabbed the wheel for the purpose of wrenching it out and bludgeoning him over the cranium with it.

The Pathfinder only costs about twenty-nine thousand smackeroos, which is about a tenth of what I got after I sued that little bugger.

The dimensions of the Pathfinder are as follows: Cargo Capacity 38 cubic ft Font Head Room 38 inches Rear Head Room 37 inches Front Leg Room 41.700 inches Rear Leg Room 31.8 inches Fuel Tank Capacity 21.100 gallons Length 182.7 inches Width 71.7 inches Height 70.900 inches Wheelbase 106.300 inches Weight 3,985 lbs Ground Clearance 8.300 inches.

It�s spacious. Not spacious-spacious. Not voluminous. It�s not the Grand Canyon of Sports Utilities, but it does feature a nice echo, and it does take a donkey and a day to get down to the floorboards if you should perchance to drop your drink box. 

Let me put that another way. A gallon of milk dropped in a grocery store will cover an entire aisle and be less than a centimeter thick. The human body holds like what? four or five gallons of blood, and they spread across the floorboards from out of my body less than a millimeter thick.

That�s what I mean by spacious.

You have to go into hibernation if you want to move up to the front seat without stopping the car from the back. But not the sort of thirty-year hibernation that would require a computer to automate it. Which eventually goes stir-crazy, starts making faulty plays in chess, telling naughty little lies, and singing about daisies and carriages, while bumping off fast slumbering cosmonauts.

The country (Like you don�t know already.) which makes the car (If this sort of thing is important to you. And if it is, just allow me to say your jingoistic, NRA patches-adorned khakis will go stunningly with the traditional grey-silver of the Pathfinder) is Japan. I respect Japan. They make affordable, lightweight cars, that when they plow into me going sixty feel as gentle as a dandelion down mizzle. Or, at most, a knuckle-cracking with a ruler by a weak-armed nun (Like that wussy Sally Field sister.)

The fuel efficiency and performance data of the Pathfinder is as follows: Horsepower RPM 240@6000 Torque RPM 265@3200 Towing Capacity 5,000 lbs City Mileage 16 mpg Highway Mileage 19 mpg.

What, pray, does that mean?

It means that going around a moderate-sized city (A minor-league franchise and a stadium, but not enough of a night life that the muggers and the highwaydudes need to stay up much past one. Which is good. A growing goon needs his beauty sleep), to about five or ten hospitals and clinics, trying to find a hospital that pleased me(Would it kill one of them to pay the extra ten-spot to put the premium channels in the patient�s bedrooms?), we only had to stop at a gas station once.

But that wasn�t to get gas.

That was to get duct tape to put over my mouth, so I would stop yelling,� I kill you� in twenty-five different languages (Hey, what can I say? I watch a lot of <i>Sesame Street</i>, and you know how much of a homicidal Elmo can become when he gets reprimanded too many times by Mister Hooper�s ghost for saying ello-meno-pee, instead of L-M-N-O-P.) 

Here�s some warranty information: (500,000=Unlimited) Basic Warranty 36 months 36,000 miles Powertrain Warranty 60 months 60,000 miles Corrosion Warranty 60 months 500,000 miles.  A little hint: They have this kind of funny clause where all of the above is voided if you peg a kid going sixty and he rivers out blood all over everything. But my lawyer said that that was standard. Roughly equivalent to the <i>The Burbs</i>-inspired, warranty-voiding NO CANNIBALIZED CADAVERS OF SUDDENLY-DISAPPEARED NEIGHBORS  IN THE TRUNK clause.

Lastly, here�s some technical junk: Brakes Disc/Drum Displacement 3.5 liters Number of Cylinders 6 cylinders Valves per Car 24 Bore 4 Stroke 3 Fuel System SEFI Location of Engine Front Fuel Type Gasoline Drive Train RWD Transmission Automatic Steering Diameter 37.4/37.4 Tire Size 245/65R17.

Now I understand all of that stuff about as easily as I can understand Boomhauer on <i>King of the Hill</i> doing a Jar-Jar Binks impression, but maybe you do. 

Have at it, Tiger.

Lastly-lastly, the Pathfinder makes a convenient coffin, as can be attested to by the people who (two weeks after) found the car and the kid at the bottom of a ravine, after he snuffed himself for lack of financial ability to cover the legal costs of striking me and his most magnificent Sports-Utility steed.
