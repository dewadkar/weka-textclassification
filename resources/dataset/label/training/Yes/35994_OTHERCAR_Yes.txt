            The title of this review was a result of my brothers reaction when I first brought home my 1992 SVX (charcoal grey) that I purchased in August 2002 with 62,000km on the clock.

10 years on, it still looks like a car that has just been released (even more so considering the exceptional condition mine was in when I bought it, a credit to the previous owner).

Just over 200 were sold in Australia between 1992 and 1997 and new, cost $75,000 - a staggering amount at the time for a car from a manufacturer that was regarded primarily as a maker of sturdy, reliable but basic cars...certainly not flagships with cutting edge styling and a price well into the 'badge cred' brigade of BMW, Audi and Mercedes.

The SVX has the grip of a WRX, the neck-turning ability of any exotic (always fun to drop the windows at a set of lights and watch people in surrounding cars look at the SVX trying to figure out what it is!), the luxury and comfort of any German car and, if it comes to it, the sheer survivabilty afforded by a 1.8 ton coupe with a massively strong cabin cell.

Although a heavy car, it is amazingly comfortable and just wafts over rough roads - people have criticised the perfomance of the SVX but it is often forgetten that a) it has 169kW and secondly, was never designed as a sports car but rather a grand tourer in the mould of the SC400, 8 series BMW and CL class (then the SEC series) Mercedes. Rest assured that once moving, the SVX has an astonishing amount of power and the ability to deploy the same through a variable torque distributioin AWD drivetrain and LSD, backed up by 4 channel ABS.

Problems:
The biggest problem with the SVX, especially the 1992-1994 series, is transmission overheating...which, to put it simply, results in lots of gunk making its way through the transmission till voila, it no longer works. A $4000AU bill follows, in addition to problems with the climate control system if the transmission is not removed in the correct way (it can damage components during the removal/replacement procedure). Mine had been rebuilt, as many have been, but I have yet to fit an auxillary transmissioncooler which is a must!!  Never never never fit a towbar!! The same transmission was also used in a number of other cars including the Q45 which I am told came with a warning not to fit a towbar due to the load on the transmission!

Also, some interior parts are quite fragile including the window switches and also the sunvisors, which have a tendancy to droop.

I would avoid cars that were not owned by either an SVX fanatic or have been through a number of owners - maintenance of the SVX will see 400,000km   before any serious work is needed - but neglect, like any car, will prove to be extremely costly.

Most SVX owners are obsessed with their cars and an excellent site is the global club at www subaru-svx net for anyone reading this contemplating purchasing one.
