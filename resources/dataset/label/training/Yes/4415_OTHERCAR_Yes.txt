            I have been driving the '95 Grand Prix SE for a little while now, and I must say that it is a great car.  The V6 packs a great punch, while at the same time it provides enough room for the friends to come along.  The ride is extremely quiet and I have received many comments on how quiet it is.  Along with the quiet ride and the V6 are the automatic locks, the automatic windows, cruise, AC, tilt, and the AM/FM stereo and cassette.

The '95 Grand Prix doesn't have the new body that the '97 and later models do, but it is still a stylish car.  I have the 4 door sedan and it looks great.  Another great feature of this car is a the large trunk.  Despite the large seating capacity, there is still a sufficient size trunk.  I think the trunk is as large as any sedan's trunk I have seen.

The Grand Prix rides quite well.  It's pick up and handling is great.  For a car from '95, it runs as well as most new cars in its class.  I highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who wants a highly reliable car with a lot of features, for a reasonable price.  If you want a car with the &quot;new&quot; look, you'll need to buy a Grand Prix from '97 or later. But still, the '95 is a good looking car.  <br><br>
