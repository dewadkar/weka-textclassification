            I bought the Finepix based on its excellent reviews and competitive price. In the 18 months of use I've had from it, I've been very pleased with results overall.

The camera is easy to use. The LCD screen can be used, and in bright sunlight a digital viewfinder is available. I actually prefer the digital versus optical viewfinder because WYSIWYG. The six times optical zoom was a big buying point for me, and I was very pleased with the results. The user interface is intuitive and functional. The software is useful, but not as helpful as I would have liked. As far as I could tell, the software was not helpful in producing a photo database, and had a bare minimum of functions. I found filing quite a chore.

The camera also performed well in extreme conditions. I spent a month skiing in Canada and the camera performed flawlessly in temperatures of 30 below (centigrade). Most impressive. In 18 months of use, the camera operated perfectly, with no lost pixels and no memory card problems.

There are a couple of downsides. The camera did not perform so well in poor lighting, and there is (as far as i can tell) no ISO adjustment or aperture settings available. The camera barrel was recently nudged accidentally and requires a fix. At current prices, it will barely be economic to do so, with the cost of realigning the barrel about equal to a new low-end 2 megapixel camera. Also, the camera has a lens cap that quickly became loose and very easily fell off at the wrong times. The LCD is not usable in bright sunlight. Finally, the camera is reasonably bulky so not especially well suited to travel.

Overall, however, a purchase I never once regretted and highly recommend. Although its getting a bit old these days, the 2800 is a solid camera, with a minimum of carefully selected and useful features that should keep an amateur photographer happy.
