             This is my first digital camera and I'm quite pleased with my purchase. I've been a Photoshop user for a few years now and my subjects have been limited to flatbed scanners and a video capturing device. This camera is a breath of fresh air. I get far better results with this camera than the run-of-the-mill point and shoot camera with a roll of film.

 I've gotten great results using this camera in a professional studio setting, in sunlight, in casual atmospheres and even in dark nightclubs. 

 The pros: Good resolution, brilliant colors, ease of use, great depth of field (unless you're taking portraits, then you'll need a good editing program), overall versatility and of course, the price.

 The cons:
 1. X2 digital zoom. This isn't good for close-ups unless they are only staying in digital form (not prints) as the pictures loose definition and will look pixelated {blocky).

 2. The flashing orange light. This could either mean that the flash isn't charged or the auto exposure and auto focus aren't locked. Either way this orange flashing happens more often than I care for. At this point you can attempt to refocus by half way pressing the shutter. When this doesn't work you can do what I do- follow through with the picture anyways. I just touch them up later.

 3. The lens cap doesn't always cooperate. I've found that when it falls off resetting it with a little twist usually takes care of this.

 4. The Camera Dock is extra. I personally haven't used this, but this is suppose to make loading and sharing your pictures easier. It also charges your batteries.   


 Other stuff you'll need:
 1. Rechargable batteries are a must.

 2. The camera itself only has 16mb of internal memory. You're going to want to get an external SD memory card if you plan on a vacation for lots of hi-res memories. 

 3. A tripod and camera bag aren't a bad idea.

 4. A photo editing program is a must for digital pics. I personally use Photoshop, but there are some easy to use and inexpensive ones that will suffice.
