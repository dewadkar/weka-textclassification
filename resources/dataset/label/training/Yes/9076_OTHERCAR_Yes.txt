            As soon as I saw the Kia Sportage 2-door convertible, I fell in love.  I first saw this vehicle a year ago, but was unable to afford it.  So, I continually lusted after it until I was finally able to afford it this August.  Ironically enough, my parents bought the four door, 4X4 version two days before I bought mine.  I went with the 2X2, two door,  dark green version.  It had the CD and cruise control I wanted, and also a 4 cylinder that did not let me down.
The vehicle handles very well, and is not very windy when the top is down.  There is plenty of room in the kia for three people, however, any more that that makes for a very tight fit.  Three weeks after I got it I went to Chicago (about a two hour drive) with myself and three other passengers, and the two in the back where very cramped.  We had little room for our belongings, and my rear passengers felt a bit unsettled because they sat right above the wheel area and could feel vibrations.

  The Kia is noisy when it gets above 65mph, as the soft top rattles and getting  into the rear cargo area is tricky because of the spare tire and soft top.  But, being as I drive mostly alone and am single , this vehicle is perfect for me.  Also, gas mileage in the city is not the greatest, however highway mileage with the cruise control is great

I have not had any major problems with it.  The only things I have encountered are : the soft top started to come apart, so the dealer ordered another, the paint on the back bumper was peeling, so the dealer had that fixed , the window seal on the drivers side was coming off and letting water leak into the car, and there was a terrible rattle in the passengers dash area.  However, all of these minor problems were fixed by the dealership under warranty.  I had no problems at all with them. I belive the the Kia's may have had paint problems, as not only did my rear bumper  peel, but my mom's front bumper started peeling the first time she washed it. 

 I think the the greatest thing about the Kia is that every where I go I get compliments on it, and perfect strangers come up and comment on it. However, when I tell co-workers and friends what I drive before they see it,  they get that grin on their face as of to say &quot;Kia, who would buy a Kia.&quot;  But, I am quick to point out that Kia has been around for a long while, and even produced the Ford Festiva and,  also,the Ford Aspire.  I eagerly await the nice sunny days we have left in central Illinois, so I can take the top down and cruise around town.  I get stares everywhere I go in this stylish, yet rugged suv.     I  love my Kia, and will consider it again!
