            I first bought this car with the pure intent of just getting something so I could go to work after my &quot;never will die&quot; Toyota couldn't be fixed at 150K miles.  I love this car, great sporty handling, I love that you sit low in it, smooth ride, great sound system, it just gets up and goes, beautifully designed and everyone wants to buy my car whenever I get a new one!  I do have to say that the seats aren't as comfortable as can be and the ride can be noisy, but when riding in other people's cars, I haven't noticed a huge difference.  Recently my car has hit 100K and is still trucking.  I would say this is a good car for singles, couples and small families.  Pretty good all around.  I bought mine used in August of 1997.  These cars also have good resale value, so a good buy all around. <br><br>
