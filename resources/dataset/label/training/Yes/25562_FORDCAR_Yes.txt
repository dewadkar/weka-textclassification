            Overall this is a great vehicle.  We live in a very snowy corner of the country.  120"/season on average.  The Sport Trac does all that we ask of it and more.  On and off road we have had reliable service and pleasant driving in our Ford.  

Here are some of our most liked attributes of the Sport Trac.
Excellent 4wd for rural applications. 
A standout in snow.
Very good room in rear seats for adults.
Sure footed on and off the road.
Excellent air conditioning and environmental controls.
Very nice stereo and sound system.
Convenient electric back window.
Short bed extender for those who do not need a full size cargo bed but could use a mid size bed from time to time.
Very good roof rack system.  Easily adaptability to most superior aftermarket roof rack systems.
Very comfortable slim line seats for driver and front seat passenger.
Excellent car like handling around corners.  
Very good tracking.

Some of the drawbacks in our opinion.
Poor gas mileage for a V-6.
Rough ride on the road at most highway speeds.
Alot of wind noise in the cab.
Dealing with our local Ford dealer.
Has not held resale value as expected.
Passenger side airbag cannot be turned off for smaller passengers.
