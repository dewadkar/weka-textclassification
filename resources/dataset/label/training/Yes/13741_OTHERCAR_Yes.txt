            I bought my Subaru Impreza Outback because I am a frequent visitor to the Rocky Mountains and I wanted a car that could handle mountain driving.  It was during a visit to Colorado that I noticed a large number of Subarus and heard them praised by the locals.

It has been driven in mountain blizzards, driving rainstorms and on steep inclines and has never disappointed me. It has almost 86,000 miles on it and at its last check-up, it was declared to be in excellent shape.  

The &quot;all wheel drive&quot; is an aid in hazardous driving conditions. 
This is a tight car with a very responsive steering mechanism. 

The one irritating thing about it is, that various plastic covers inside the car don't stay on. 

I would recommend the car to anyone who wants a &quot;work horse&quot; of a car that requires little maintenance other than oil changes, etc. <br><br>
