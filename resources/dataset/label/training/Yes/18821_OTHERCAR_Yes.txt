            This is my 3rd Jeep.. Started my Jeep habit with a 1969 Jeepster Commando, Then onto a Wrangler in 1989, now I have a Cherokee... Nice ride and great price for all the options you get great warranty. Jeeps just keep on running... That is where they get the slogans, &quot;Only in a Jeep&quot; or it is a Jeep thing you wouldn't understand!!!! Parts are reasonably priced and very easy to repair. They all run great and just can't kill em. The 1969 commando has over 300,000 miles on it and starts up everyday. The 1989 Wrangler has close to 200,000 and is the sharpest one in town..  I have owned other brands of vehicles; not as reliable as the Jeep.  You can go buy a sport Ute for $30k and you will not get your money's worth. I Love My new Cherokee and only paid 17K for it. I am sure I will have it a very long time also... <br><br>
