            You have 3 dollars on you and an empty camera.  You have this hot date where you know the camera will come in handy later in the day...No film, no luck...but wait!!!  A box of floppy disk costs just about that.  What do you do?

What a nifty product.  And the perks of working at sony, so called product training....taking these bad boy toys home for a weekend, can't ask for more.

The quality of this is excellent, though painstakenly slow when you try to use the optimal digital options such as higher resolution, fine quality and larger picture dimensions.  But under normal settings, this camera is on top of my letter to Santa.

Being a Sony Mavica, there are no need for those expensive films to buy.  The Mavica uses a simple floppy drive to record your data which you can convert to mpg, jpg, mpeg.  

Simple snapshots can be reviewed in a nice size digital window to erase those certain pics that captures people with thier eyes shut, wrong angle shot, or taking a picture of  naked women that freak out that thier pictures were taken...whew, yea, you can be glad that you are able to delete these pics as you like.

The movie capture is a neat little feature.  5/10/15 seconds.  The 10 seconds takes half the disk.  15 seconds takes the full disk.  And depending what quality option you have, you can mix the qick movie (5/10) and still have about 6-12 pics on one Disk.  So playing with the options would be advisable.

The floppies are obviously easy PC transferable, and if you have a picture making printer...the benefits are enormous.  But the greatest benefit is taking the floppies to a Kmart, Walmart, or a copying place where they can transfer the image from floppy to Kodac (or other maker) paper with ease (paper for home use is quite expensive not to mention the ink used).  This camera also has AV out connections to view on your tv or even transfer to a digital camera.

The camera is durable enough to take to an amusment park.  And the simple one button snap is not hard to miss.  The movie, picture, review option is done through a switch right on the back of the camera...so fondling with the thing is limited.  Once you actually set the options, there is hardly much more to actually do.  Oh, and the camera also has an option to create neat little pictures like Black and white, opaque, solorized, and so on.  Showing off would be one great benefit, so playing with the functions is a non stop hoopla.

The weight and size is larger than those diposable cameras.  But what do you expect when you are given a blow torch with a swiss army knife features over a simple lighter in combat?<br><br>
