            I previously had and loved a 1988 Porsche Cab.  The AC in the 88 did not keep up in the Houston Area.  I was rear-ended by a Suburban and my baby was toast.  

So when looking for another car I decided to upgrade to a newer year.  I went with a 1995 Porsche 911 Coupe.  I did miss the cab but the 95 coupe was more practicle in the Houston Heat.  The car was great I had it for two years.  I bought it for 37,500 with High miles 77K and drove it for 2 yrs and sold it for 36,000 with 92K.  

Cost of ownership stands up to most cars and I was driving a Porsche.  The men envy you and the women love you.  It was a great car and I am looking to get another 95-98 with lower miles.  The down falls are oil changes.  The car takes 10.5 quarts of oil.  Really recommend Mobil 1.  I also changed it every 3,000 miles considering it had high miles on it already.  Anyway 11 quarts of oil and 2 oil filters about $15.00 a piece.  Also it cost about $140 to have it changed.  2 hours at 70.00.  You basically have to remove the exaust system to change the oil.  The only other problem I had was the AC Condenser went out.  About $ 1100.  The red paint was tough to keep a shine.  I waxed about once a month to prevent fade.  When it shines it is awesome.


The car handles like a dream and I was never even tested when running.  Cops respect you more than the Mustangs and leave you alone.  I normally cruised at 90-95 mph with great control.  The stereo is a little out of the way.  

The 95-98 car is the best Porsche ever made.  It has power and enough driver input to make it fun.  The New ones are way too refined.  This car leans more to a man owner.  The new ones are more female oriented.  Stereo-types taken into consideration of course.  I loved it and will buy another.  Maybe a cab again next time.<br><br>
