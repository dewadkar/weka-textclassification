            I purchased a Ranger August 1999. So far it has been very reliable,
though the ignition switch was defective. They gave me a loaner car, picked the truck up and had a new switch in it that evening, high marks for service. Shorter people and ladies I would suggest you get a step installed &lt;it is somewhat high off the ground&gt;. Gas mileage is ok not as good as my Honda Accord but ok...a larger tank would have been nice...range is about 300 miles. Handles well in the city....bounces some at highway speed if you don't have it loaded down.CD player is very nice and the sound system is near the quality of the Accord. Overall I would rate it an 8 on a scale of 1-10.Used for getting back and forth to work...and camping.On long trips I would suggest taking along some pillows, the seats get a little old after 2 hours. My girlfriend drives it more than I do and gets compliments on the color and its sporty.<br><br>
