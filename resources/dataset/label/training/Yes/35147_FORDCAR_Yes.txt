            The Escort ZX2 is impressive from several view points.
1.  It is a quick little automobile. The DOHC, 4 valves-per-cylinder, variable cam timing powerplant is EXCELLENT! With decent low speed torque, a useable rev. limit over 6500 rpm, and 130 responsive horsepower, acceleration is a strong point: the 5 speed manual trans. has appropriate ratios for vigorous driving, although the shifter is a tad sticky and vague.  The clutch engages smoothly, with no excess slippage. 
Right off the showroom floor, it will run low 16/upper 15 second quarter miles. Zero-to-sixty times are under 9 seconds. That makes it one of the faster cars in the pocket-rocket class of econo-sports sedans.
As a long time car nut, I find it satisfying to drive, on several levels.
2. The ZX2 will bend corners as well as, or better than, many more expensive performance automobiles. The stock 15 inch alloy wheels and Goodyear Eagle tires contribute to the great handling. 
It does not corner as well as my son's Miata, but I found it to be in that general class. 
The handling qualities exceed the abilities of most of the drivers who will buy this car.  It goes, stops, and turns very well, and improvements (i.e. bigger, better tires, and 16 inch wheels) are relatively inexpensive and readily available.
3.  The styling isn't my favorite.  The front end treatment is very smooth, but I feel the rear needs a little work, from an appearance standpoint.  By the same token, and in my opinion, the wheels are OK, but not the best I've ever seen. Ford could have improved the wheels by polishing them.  For production wheels, they are just OK.
4. The brakes are very good ,although I wish rear disks were available, and I didn't buy the optional ABS.  Ford's mistake; my mistake, in that order.
5. Although not a strictly performance feature, I found the six disc CD changer plus cassette sound system to be a most enjoyable option.  The sound quality and features are a cut above the average.
6. My current opinion is that I would buy a ZX2 before I would buy a Focus ZX3.  The ZX2 is less expensive and much better looking, and, I believe, the performance is better.  Ford goofed severely when they cut the ZX2 and the Probe GT, (and the V8 Mustang LX coupe, for that matter), from production. The Focus will have to improve with age before it supplants the ZX2 on my list of desireable performance driving machines.          <br><br>
