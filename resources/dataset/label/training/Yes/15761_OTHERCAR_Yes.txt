            i wanted a vehicle that would haul my stuff everywhere (skis, snowboard, windsurf...) and that would have all wheel drive.  the legacy GT met all my conditions -- price, flexibility, looks, reliability.  i had a 96 VW passat which was great and i would have kept, except it was front wheel drive.  i've driven the subaru in a couple of very serious snowstorms and it was terrific: great traction gave me tremendous confidence (overconfidence?).

two dislikes: as an automatic, it doesn't have a great deal of off the line power.  also, if you don't screw the cap on super tight, the check engine light comes on.

it drives very handily.  even at 80 MPH (if one were inclined to go that fast).  it handles excellently and is peppy, albeit not off the line fast.

buy this car if you want style, lots of room, good but not great gas mileage and the ability to get through any highway muck -- rain, sleet, snow.

because it has a dampener underneath and doesn't have tons of clearance, don't buy this car if you are planning on doing a lot of off roading.  this is a highway/city car, not a true off road 4WD.
