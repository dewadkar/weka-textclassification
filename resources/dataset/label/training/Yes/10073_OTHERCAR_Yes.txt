            Nissan has done it again.  They have been the leaders of the industry in the pickup truck dept.  1st compact truck in America, 1st long bed truck in America, 1st extended cab in America, 1st American made import truck, 1st true 4 door compact truck in America and first to offer a supercharger in a compact truck.  So here comes along the Xterra, a true SUV.  Not some car dressed up to look like a SUV (RAV4, CR-V, etc.).  

The Xterra has bold styling which really stands out from the crowd.  Very roomy interior with all the controls laid out perfectly.  Nissan does a great job in the ergonomics dept, everything is where it's supposed to be.  

The ride is a little on the harsh side if you're comparing it with a car but for an SUV it is very smooth.  It lacks a little in the power dept though.  The supercharged version of this truck will be offered for the 02 model due in a couple of months.  That should satisfy all you power hungry, lead footed people out there.  

I highly recommend getting the SE package because it comes with a V6 engine, 4wheel ABS, limited slip differential, 6 disk CD changer and all the other little gadgets.

Overall, the Xterra is a wonderful SUV to own.  If you are a weekend off-roader or just want to haul the kids around town this truck will do the job.
