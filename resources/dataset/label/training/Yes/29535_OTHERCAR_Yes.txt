            Two months ago, I bought a refurbished Kodak DC240 Zoom camera from overstock.com and have been having a fun time. The camera cost under $300 from the discounter. Since a lot of companies rushed in to the digital camera market, we are now buyer's market--take advantage of the collapsing dot coms! With a little bit of looking you can find a terrific deal on a good camera.

The DC240 is an upper range amateur camera. It takes clear, crisp landscape photos, and family snapshots. I brought it to a basketball game. The camera was not able to capture action shots or movement. The girls on the team were just blurs.

The recording of the image is a little bit slow, so the camera is not good for taking rapid series of photos, and I haven't figured out the trick for taking wildlife or plant photos. The landscape pictures and portraits have all turned out fantastic. Make sure that the camera you purchase can take the type of pictures you want to take.

I found that it is easier to use Easy Photo application to download the pictures than the Adobe photo shop program. Kodak includes rechargeable batteries an a charger--which are both nice features.

I registered the domain name www.protophoto.com, and will place the pictures in the near future.
