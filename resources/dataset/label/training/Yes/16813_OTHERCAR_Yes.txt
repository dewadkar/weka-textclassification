            The sports car for so many of us that work hard for middle-income wages is the Chevrolet Camaro.  I have priced the 305-hp V-8 Camaro Z-28 at only $22,000.  Powerful and stylish, the Camaro is a great choice for people who cannot afford the upper-class sports cars.  To make your ride even more slick and fun, try the convertible or T-Top options which let you enjoy the sun as you are cruising along.  
I own a 1999 black Camaro V-6, and while it does not have the punch as a Z-28, with the manual 5-speed transmission you still have some really good get-up and go.  Looks are not everything, they are the only thing and the Camaro is one of the best-looking vehicles on the market today.<br><br>
