               From a mommy's viewpoint, the 2000 Vitara 4 door definitely comes through.  It rides well, is very quiet, and proves to be compact enough to make those tight u-turns without much effort.  We affectionately call our Suzuki &quot;Suzy;&quot; it's not terribly original, but she doesn't complain.

    On the &quot;road of life&quot; I'm always the passenger--my poor vision gives me the shotgun seat every time--so this opinion will be from the perpetual navigator's point of view.  However my husband (the perpetual driver) does have one important point of value:  don't get an automatic.  Five speed is the only way to go, because the vitara is NO acceleration demon.  

     I love our Vitara for the reasons listed above, not to mention it's  THE best looking compact SUV out there.  I also like the backdoor.  It opens like a door, not a tailgate.  For more space a door net can be purchased at the dealers.  

     As for problems, there was one unexpected hassle I found out after we purchased it for $16,700 in Texas (quite affordable!).  I had assumed the back seat (which sits nice and high by the way) would seat my two children's car seats, with enough for me in the middle.  No way.  Just something to keep in mind!  Also the passenger's side in the front (my seat) has cramped space for the left leg in particular.  We also got the attractive red jewel tone for the exterior color; in retrospect this wasn't such a hot idea because EVERY piece of road funk shows up quite well on it in contrast.  

     In short, the Vitara is one cute ut.  It's never given us any troubles (which is more than I can say for my late Suburu, &quot;Scooby&quot;), and from the mommy's view it's a great asset to the family.
