            I bought this car in April of 1997 new. I was upgrading from a 1991 Ford Escort that I had experienced several problems with and was excited to be getting something brand new. I choose to spend my money on the neon for a number of reasons. I really liked the way it looked. It has a somewhat sporty look. I found it drove great, and handled well. The clincher for me was that the price was right. I needed car that could take me the 40-50 miles a day that I was commuting between school, work and home reliably. All this on a collage students budget. The neon did all of this!

Here I am 3 years later, out of school, no longer working out of the home, and with a 2 year old to tote around. My needs have changed dramatically but the Neon is still keeping me happy. I haven't had to fix anything on the car other than routine maitance. My two year old's car seat fits nicely in the back. It is a little tight to fit my bulky stroller in the trunk along with my jumper cables and other winter items I need to keep in the trunk. But that is my only real complaint and it is a compact car, that is to be expected. 

It has two bucket seats in front and a single bench in the back. I have been comfortable on both short trips to the grocery store or the 250 miles from my home to visit family. I just don't recommend long drives in the back seat with a car seat for an adult. Not a lot of extra room. It would be fine for two adults without a car seat, but the car seat makes things more snug. 

All around a reliable car. If you don't have a lot of money to spend, but want a car that will keep you happy. I recommend the Neon. It has kept me happy for 3 years now, and I'm sure it will keep me happy for at least a few more. <br><br>
