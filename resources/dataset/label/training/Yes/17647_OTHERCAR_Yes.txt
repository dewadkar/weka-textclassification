            Compare it to the new Audi A4, the Jaguar X-Type, the Mercedes C-Class, even the highly esteemed Infiniti G35...compare it to whatever you want, but there's a reason this car has been on Car & Driver's Top Ten List for years in a row now...

First, let's get the bad out of the way...The interior of the 330i, even with the premium package I purchased is slightly outdated...I'm not a huge fan of the red lighting and the middle panel, it could easily be modernized...compare it to the BMW 7 series and they dont even look like they're in the same family...

Now, the good, which is, just about everything else...Great power in the 330i - the 225 hp really kicks, extremely smooth power delivery - and, of course, as with every other BMW, unmatched handling...true, your Japanese cars can more horsepower, but the reason they keep pumping it in (eg - the G35) is because they cannot match the German inspired handling that comes with a BMW...nothing, this side of a Porsche or Ferrari, can match this handling...

Take a G35 in the slalom, you can't match the BMW...The German feel is really worth it all, and no one, no even Mercedes, delivers the German feel like a BMW...Fit and finish are of course top notch and although the interior could be a bit more modern, there is an undeniable sense of quality once sitting inside...Beautiful woodwork, supple leather seats are all part of the premium package...

It's a perfect everyday car...you can drive it easily or you can drive it like a sports car, and trust me, you can toss this baby around like a sports car...I can't emphasize the handling enough...the car simply rides like its on rails...

The 3 series is still the king of its segment!
