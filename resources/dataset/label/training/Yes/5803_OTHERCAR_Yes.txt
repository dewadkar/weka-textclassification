            Hello to Everyone,

   I have had this camera for about 3-4 months and have taken some really nice pictures and had some developed and blown up to 11x14. I plan to make some more pictures that I have taken and develope them for christmas.

   The Camera is a 2.1MP and can produse a 16x20 print without distortion.  It has a 3x Optical Zoom (Which is the actual lens moving.) and a 2.5x Telephoto Zoom which is really just blown up.  It is the top of the line of the Olympus Point and Shoot Cameras but it features alot of manual settings too.  The camera is also equipped with a QuickTime moive mode which allows you to record video (But no sound) depending on the size of your memory card you can records for several minutes.

   The only thing that I have found with this camera and many other Olympus Cameras that is lacks the USB port for downloading and when taking larger pictures it takes a lot longer to download so I recommend a USB Card Reader or something.

   I haven't had any problems with the camera yet and hope not to have any in the future.  Buttons are located in good places and the zoom button is located perfectly so that you don't have to ever take your eye off the shot.

   I recommend this camera for anyone that is not looking for the cheapest but not the most expenisive either.  I have enjoyed this camera very much along with other Olympus Digital Cameras. <br><br>
