            I have owned a lot of Subaru's in my life, including an &quot;84&quot; Subaru GL with 200,000 miles,an &quot;89&quot; XT-6 with 140,000, &quot;93&quot; Legacy and &quot;93&quot; Impreza.  One thing about Subaru's they seem to never stop running no matter how hard you are them.  All of the above Subaru's I have owned are still in the family and still running minus the legacy that was totaled in a car accident.

The Legacy, oh yes, what a wonderful car, but what an ugly color.  I owned a Gold &quot;93&quot; Legacy that had over 110,000 miles on it when it got totaled.  My husband and I bought it used with 100,000 miles on it.  It was a great running car and we owned it for a little over a year.  The only thing we ever did was change the oil and it ran great.

I remember one time in particular the four-wheel drive system saved my life.  I was driving on a two-lane highway and a bale of straw fell off of a truck ahead of me.  It was at night so I did not see it till I was right up on it.  I could not swerve to miss it as someone was coming in the other direction and I had someone right behind me so I could not slow down rapidly.  I ended up hitting it, but never lost control of the car.  I felt the tires grab the road just as it started to slip and my Subaru pulled me right along.

On Valentines Day my husband was driving it and was hit by a truck.  The truck looked worse then our car.  The car actually looked fine except the front grill was smashed in and the left front panel.  The hood of the car only had a tiny dent in it.  The truck on the other hand could not even be towed away because the frame of the truck was broke in half.  The only reason the insurance  totaled the car out was because it was not worth very much.

One thing about Subaru's they can take a pounding both physically and mechanically and keep running.  They have amazed me, my first car was a Subaru and I plan to have my last car to be a Subaru as well.

This car is also the easiest car I have ever seen when it comes to changing the oil.  Everything is right up front and easy to get to.  Also open the hood of one of these cars and you will notice how everything is color coded and easy to find.  This car is driver friendly in every sense of the word.
