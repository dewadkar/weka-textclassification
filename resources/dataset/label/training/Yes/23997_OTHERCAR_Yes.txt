            PREAMBLE (feel free to skip):  

Okay, so I adore used cars.  I've owned 3 used Toyotas (Camry 83, 84, 89) and two used Hondas (Accord 89, 92 ).  Consumer Reports can tell you that Honda and Toyota are two of the most reliable brands in used cars, and my personal experience has done nothing but confirm it.  I lost one of my cars in a natural disaster (it drowned in a flood), but the rest, I drove into the ground; to their very last gasp.

Because Honda and Toyota hold their value, my insurance company covered the cost when my 83 Camry was clobbered by a tree (yet another natural disaster) in 1996, and that car drove on to the ripe, old age of 17 years.

TIPS FOR BUYING A USED CAR:

Even when buying a good brand, protect yourself when purchasing a used car.

* Is the current owner the original owner?  (Clearly, if the car has changed hands a lot, that is not a good sign!)
* Does the current owner seem like a responsible person - who has changed the oil (ever 3K or so) and treated the car well?
* How has the current owner used the car (for commute only, for long trips, highway miles or just back and forth to the train station - all these things will affect the life of the car)
* Ask if the car has ever been in an accident
* Has the current owner kept all repair receipts on the car?
* TAKE THE CAR TO A MECHANIC before purchasing the car!  (even the nicest of people may not know that the car is about to require a new radiator - and that could significantly affect the price you want to pay)

REVIEW:

If you are looking for a used car, I recommend the Honda Accord (unless you are petite - see below!)  The 92 Accord is a quality and roomy car, and since owning mine for more than a year now, it has only needed the usual repairs (that any used car with more than 90K is going to require - i.e. brakes).  In one year, I put 25K on it, driving it from NY to FL, and from one end of VT to the other - without any cause for complaint.

For those, like me, who are petite (5'1" or less), you may need a pillow behind your back to comfortably situate yourself in the driver's seat.  I learned, after buying the car, that Honda, itself, owns up to the fact that its cars are not built especially well for smaller people.  So, when test driving, make sure the car is the right FIT for you!

All in all, I am continuously impressed by the reliability and quality of the Honda Accord.
