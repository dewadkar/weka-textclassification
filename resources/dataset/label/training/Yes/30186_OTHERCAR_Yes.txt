            Chrysler is an American name. With an American name, you should be able to trust the manufacturer. A Chrysler LeBaron is a car you can trust. It's reliable, and get's you where you need to go. I own a 1990 LeBaron Turbo GT Convertible and it's a car I won't give up. I've driven it for two years and it hasn't failed me since. All I've needed to do is change the oil, rotate and buy new tires, and install a new battery. The drivers seat is comfortable, and is electric, so you can move it to fit your own needs. I love the way it handles, and the way it picks up speed. This is a fast car. The draw backs of this car are few. The back seat is small, with little leg room, but can fit two adults. The turning radius is nothing to brag about. When all is said and done, it's a great car!<br><br>
