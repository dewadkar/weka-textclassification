            I have a lot of experience with this car in it's many forms. first let me say that i beleive that many of the opinions i have read here are not credible.  Mainly because they have had very little experience with the car's many flavors.  Therefore many judgements are made without all the possible facts.

first a little about me.  I am a used car salesman, have driven a number of cars as you might imagine.  Second i am 6'3&quot; and about 250 pounds, in other words i am a big guy.  Why is that important?  Because it demonstrates a few points.  The first time i drove a Focus, i was extremely impressed by how much room i had to sit and drive the car.  more then ample headroom and legroom to boot!  Even my 6'7&quot; father was able to drive it without getting a headache.  Second, is that the first time i took the back seat, i was was more then pleased with the room.  i was riding along with a couple who were looking for a new car.  he was driving with the seat all the way back and i could sit directly behind him, knees together, and was comfortable( they bought it by the way). If you are considering this car, sit all over in it and just TRY to get uncomfortable, not easy.  especially for a car in this category.

I wouldn't recommend the base engine though, for $200 you get the much more lively Zetec.  Trust me on this one.

This car is a blast to drive!  if i lived where there were lots of twisty roads i would be in heaven with this car!  IT out handles anything in it's category, and it's ride quality is superb!  they out did themselves on this part of the car. i think that the suspension work makes the car.

If you are looking for practical, look at everything else first, then look at a Focus.  the smart little details in the cockpit and all over the car just jump out at you when compared to it's competitors, then look at the sticker, and you should be hooked.  Can you tell i love this car?

i chose the wagon version of the car, WOW!  for a little under 16k i have anti-lock brakes full power and a heck-uva lot of room!

The only thing about this car that i would like to see improved is that the interiors that i have seen haven't been consistent.  some are very good, some not so good.  so watch this before you buy one.  but over all considering what you pay for the car.  i wouldn't expect Mercedes fit and trim.
