            The Active Package features a ski sack, heated front seats, a headlamp washer system and rain sensors for the windshield wipers. The major strike against the X5 is the price, while it offers a degree of refinement and performance that cannot be equaled in this class; it also commands a hefty premium. When a buyer starts to add options, things get hairy. 

In all the BMW X5 offers the Luxury SUV market segment some thing it has never seen before in the performance categories, but is a loser on the dollar side, its only saving grace being all service inside the warranty period is included in the vehicle price. 

Of particular interest is the $35-40,000 range because of its current status as the �hot� market, with many new vehicles spanning the gap between the Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer and the Chrysler Town & Country. The price? Well, base MSRP (which is what it�ll cost you for the foreseeable future) is $49,907 with the $570 destination charge included. This is WITHOUT options. However, the Sports Package would add $2470. 

Suffice it to say the X5 has a VERY long list of standard features already, some of which include dual zone automatic A/C, an alarm system with keyless entry, traction control, leather seating with dual 8-way power front seats, six airbags for the front passengers (and four available as an option for the rear passengers), a memory system for he armrest is quite unique in design, and there is plenty of storage space in the map pockets, the center armrest, and behind the shifter. Overall, the 2000 BMW is a fantastic rush to drive. 

If you have always wanted the commanding view, hauling/towing ability, and AWD stability of an SUV-like vehicle, combined with the handling of a BMW 5-series sedan, this is the only vehicle that matters. 

The Mercedes ML 430 may come closest (MSRP with freight, $44,395.00), but although it is very car-like and luxurious concerning ride, it just doesn�t handle as well in the sense of a true luxury sports sedan. 

Perhaps the Mercedes ML55 (MSRP with freight $65,545.00) would be a better comparison, but you pay much more, wait for the right, and even then, I don�t know that the handling will be the same.
