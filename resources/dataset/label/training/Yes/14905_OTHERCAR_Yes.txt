            I bought this product in late 1998 because Sony sold me with the floppy recording system.  I can take my pictures anywhere and easily see or show them on most computers!  The zoom, ability to record with different resolutions and more, copy, delete, preview are all quite useful! Plus, my images are already stored on floppy where I can delete or save only what I want very easily.  I can't imagine having a digital camera  without these features.  My two main complaints -- getting used to shooting via a view screen and battery life.  The re-charge battery does last a couple hours, but I am too constantly aware of how &quot;little&quot; time I have left to shoot or play back my images.   And, the program that came with the photos is very easy to use and easy to export to other fun photo imaging programs.  <br><br>
