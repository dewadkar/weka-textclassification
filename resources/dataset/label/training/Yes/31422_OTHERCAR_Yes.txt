            IF you can afford luxurious cars, and your lease is up then there is only one way to go. You have to pick the Jaguar XK Convertible. This is one of the nicest designed cars out. The roof is very easy to take down; since, the car comes with an automatic switch. The trunk has a lot of space, but the car is only roomy in the front. It comes with a leather interior that makes the seats feel like a bed. There are many options with this car. It comes with a great warranty and is a very reliable car. Ford has done a superb job improving the Jaguar; since, they moved it out of England. If you have the money and you want to feel young buy the Jaguar XK.<br><br>
