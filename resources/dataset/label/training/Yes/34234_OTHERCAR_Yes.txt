            I recently bought the Toyota Solara Convertible and I really do enjoy
the car.  It handles nicely....takes curves smoothly and drives relatively
quietly.  It has a nice smooth ride and I think the car has all around
nice lines.  

It's a very sport car and for a convertible has a very generous back
seat which is hard to find in convertible/sports cars.

My major problem with this car is the sound system.  When you get above
certain volume levels it sort of rattles and just sounds horrible.  I'm
really very disappointed in this as I'm a very big fan of music and enjoy
listening while I'm driving.

When using the cd player the sound is substantially better....but the
radio just stinks!!!!!

Other than that I am enjoying the car.  The convertible top is pretty
easy to get up and down without much hassle which I enjoy.  The trunk
is spacious and the seating is very comfortable.

I do wish they had an automatic trunk release on the key ring which my
past cars have had.....but that's something I can learn to live without.

All in all, for the price.....I think it's a decent car.<br><br>
