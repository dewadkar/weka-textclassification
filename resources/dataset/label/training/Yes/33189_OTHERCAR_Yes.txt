            The VW Golf was my first car; I'm still driving one today. And to be honest, I'm just as happy now as the day when I first got it.

I can't see how anyone can dislike the Golf. They are powerful, reliable and good-looking, which all rank pretty high on my scale. And an added bonus: although they are above average price - they hold their price extremely well.

So, what's the car like to drive: it's a corker. I'm from the UK, and am lucky enough to have driven both the automatic, and the manual versions and they are both brilliant. The automatic version is so easy to drive, a 12 year old could probably do it. And the power you get when you put your foot down.... fantastic. There's nothing better than overtaking some flashy business-type on the highway - remember that even a 1991 VW Golf can hold its own with most cars today. The manual version's just as easy: except that you can really give the car some revs in the change from first to second gear.

Also, the car's superbly reliable; I've never had any problems with mine. The Golf loves a long drive, and I don't mind giving it one.

At today's prices, the 1991 Golf is an absolute steal. You may think that you're buying a really old car, but remember: it's the fun that counts.

One tip: Watch out for the 1.8GTi Versions that are kicking around. They are not that much more expensive, and you'll be getting a lot more power for your money.<br><br>
