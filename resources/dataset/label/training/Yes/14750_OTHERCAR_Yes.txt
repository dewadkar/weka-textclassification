                 Honda's Insight gets beat up by its older sibling, the CRX.  The CRX Si offers twice the fun of the HF model for just a few hundred dollars and a few more miles per gallon.  The CRX has been rated in the top ten used cars for under $10,000 in countless polls and magazines.  Offering 108 horsepower from a 1.6 liter engine in a light two seater, this car is very quick.
     A big reason for my liking of the CRX is all the things you can do to them.  Countless kits are available for the engine and bodies of these cars with easy instalation.  I have seen CRXs modifies into low riders, wagons, and hoppers.  The caps built for Nissan's Pulsar can easily fit a CRX and with some paint you have something totally different, that can seat four (I'm not sure how legal extra passengers are in a CRX.) 
     My only complaints about CRXs are the rust caused by salt(northern winters) and that fifth gear seams to be just there for looks.<br><br>
