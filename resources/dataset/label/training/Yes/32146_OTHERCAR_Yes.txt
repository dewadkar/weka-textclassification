            If you are looking for a small, yet powerfull, gas saving, good looking little car and fun car, the DAEWOO LANOS is for you!  I have owned a 1970 Chevy Malibu, 1986 Sprint, 1990 Pontiac Sunbird, 1995 Pontiac Grand Am, and now the LANOS and I have to say it is the best car I have ever owned and these are the reasons why...

At first glance I thought to myself &quot;This is a go kart not a car, it looks like my old Chevy Sprint, however it seems heavier and more solid. I then thought &quot;Hey this looks like a 1977 Honda Civic&quot; I decided to take a test drive.. The seat was very comfortable, and I was suprized by the roomyness of the car, it looks small and cramped but when you actually get into it it was really suprisingly roomy!  I started the engine and drove off. With the windows closed I could not here anything, it was so quiet. I was suprized also when I found that the speed of this car seemed more powerfull than the 1995 Grand Am, they both had v4 engine, but I Guess when you have a small engine in a Grand Am which is bigger and heavier than a Lanos it drives slower than the lanos... I then wanted to try it up a hill, because I remember with my Chevy Sprint going up a hill was insane and slow and pathetic.. So I drove up Victory Blvd. In Los Angeles a very steep hill... I hit the &quot;Turbo&quot; switch or Overdrive etc... and was again Suprized to see how great this thing worked up the hill... I drove it back to the dealership and bought it!!!  

I have had it 1 1/2 years now and have never had a problem with it. It still drives smoothly and it has saved me hundreds of $$ per year on Gasoline.  The only thing I notice about this car that I don't like is  .. People in L.A. are always in a hurry and always speeding and are agressive... Now let me say that I do not drive slow, I drive faster than the speed limits on a regular basis &lt;shhh don't tell the cops or my insurance company&gt; even though Im not driving like a 102 year old person people tailgate me and drive around me all the time.. I don't know if it is because it is a small car and they are not intimidated by it, or it makes an illusion of a car driving slow or what, but it really ticks me off. I never had this happen with my other cars &lt;even the sprint&gt; it is very weird. Someone should do a study on this..

Final Thoughts :  If you want a small yet powerfull, comfortable, reliable car and you don't have ROAD RAGE, then get this car!  

If you are over 6'2 or over 300 pounds do not get this car, if you have road rage do not get this car. 

Good Luck! I hope this helped you with your decision..<br><br>
