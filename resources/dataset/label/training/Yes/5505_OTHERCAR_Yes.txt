            My Chevy Cavalier is the smartest purchase I think I've ever made. I bought it brand new in 1992 for $10,400. I wanted a car that was inexpensive, low on maintenance, on good on gas. I got all that and much more. 

After 93,000 miles, I am just now replacing the original tires and rear brakes. Other than that, all I've needed to put into the car were front brakes, oil changes, and tune-ups. I've never owned a car that has required this little maintenance after so many miles. I have saved quite a bit of money over the years by choosing this car.

The Cavalier is  sporty looking, has a smooth ride, and is fun and economical to drive. Although I love my car, my next vehicle will be a pickup truck(I need something with more hauling capability). Even though my next vehicle is several years away, I plan to stay with a GM(Chevy) model. Until then, I will enjoy my cavalier for many years to come. It will last longer than I ever thought it would. Even today's Cavalier models appear to still be a great value for the money! <br><br>
