            We have owned the Saturn SW1 wagon since '93, and we wanted a larger car this time.  Since everyone in our area drives SUVs, we almost felt we needed to get one for self-protection in an accident, but after driving the LS-series from Saturn, we changed our mind.  We're sold on the Saturn sales-style: no pressure, good information.  The car handles easily, and I really notice the difference on curves.  It has great acceleration and a very smooth ride.  

The best features for me are the interior roominess and the quality, solid feeling of the body .. when you shut the door, you really feel the solidity of the body structure.  The trunk space is very large, and we also like the fact that one or both back seats can fold flat so that larger items can be accommodated.

Our earlier Saturn has had some minor body integrity problems with rain dripping directly onto the seats and wind sometimes whistling through the vents and windows even when tightly closed.  This one seems much more secure and intact.  The sound system is good; we paid slightly more for a cassette player as CD was standard! (spouse didn't want to mess with CDs in the car.)  How things change.<br><br>
