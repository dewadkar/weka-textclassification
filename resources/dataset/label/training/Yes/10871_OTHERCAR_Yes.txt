            After leasing two Nissan Altimas over the past six years, my husband and I made the decision to but his current dream vehicle, the Pathfinder.  Not necessarily my dream vehicle but I'm thrilled (with everything except the gas mileage unfortunately).

I have to admit I was intimidated at first.  I had never driven a large car, truck or SUV before.  I couldn't believe how well it handled especially on the slick roads I was driving on due to the previous day's snow (thank goodness for 4-wheel drive!!!).  This purchase has turned out to be perfect for us - no kids yet but plenty of room for them anyway.

The truck we bought is a 1997 model, &quot;pre-owned&quot; with about 30K miles.  I was concerned about the mileage at first but the engine purrs, it runs smoothly and thanks to the care of the previous owner is in perfect condition inside and out.

My past experience with Nissan has shown me that they manufacture quality vehicles and my concerns about owning a used model are minimal.  As I stated before, and as hideously stereotypically &quot;girly&quot; it sounds, I was concerned about my ability to drive this truck.  My worries turned out to be ridiculous.

Ladies, forget the mini-van, get yourself an SUV.<br><br>
