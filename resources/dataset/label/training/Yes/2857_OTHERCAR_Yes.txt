            This is my first review, so if I've missed anything out, please don't hesitate to leave a comment & I'll try to answer any questions! 

I was looking for reviews on the Olympus MJU 300 digital camera and found none, so thought I'd set the ball rolling. So here goes.. 

N.B. I live in the UK, so some aspects of this review might not apply, but I'll try to keep it as product-related as possible.

I had decided to buy a digital camera because I am moving to France for a year and wanted to record my experiences there. I started off by just browsing the different cameras in my price range (around �300 - $480). I was immediately drawn to the MJU 300 because it looked so sleek and attractively designed, especially compared to some of the Nikons, which were far bulkier. Having shopped around, I finally paid �243, including a 10% student discount (US $390). 

To be honest, I was more in the market for a point and shoot camera than anything particularly professional, but I did some research to make sure I was getting the best spec. for my money. I was particularly impressed by the zoom quality, the movie mode and the generally sharp, clear pictures it gave me when I was trying it out and my opinion has not changed in the weeks I have had the camera. 

I bought an upgrade for the picture card and can now store 160 pictures on the camera at a time, which is plenty for me - I didn't feel the 16MB card was enough. I found setting up the camera simple to say the least and the battery only took 2 hours to fully charge from new. They even included a Continental adapter so I can use it easily in France (we have different electricity plugs here). How convenient! 

Having taken my pictures, I then set up the software on my computer. Many of my friends have had problems transferring their photos from their camera to the PC, but the software provided was excellent; simple, easy to use and yet still powerful. I have, as yet, had no problems transferring, editing & printing images. It is wise to read the manual properly first as Olympus use symbols for different functions and commands, so it's a bit confusing if you don't learn what they mean first. You get the hang of it really quickly, however, and after that it's no problem.  

My one complaint would be that there was no case provided and I have had difficulty finding one to fit - you need something to protect the screen from scratches and surely it wouldn't cost much to provide a basic, cheap pouch, especially as they even went to the trouble of providing 24 months free cover with www.yellowtag.com? 

The camera itself, however, has been wonderful - it looks great, is easy to use and takes excellent photos. I would recommend without hesitation.
