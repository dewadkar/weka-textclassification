            I bought a '98 Dodge Dakota SLT Club Cab 4X4. I bought it brand new, right off the lot. I got every feature I wanted and couldn't be more pleased. The new Dakotas offered me the option of being a functional vehicle for pulling my boat as well as the &quot;trendiness&quot; of an SUV. The optional V8 has proven an asset in an area known for having some &quot;difficult&quot; weather (Wisconsin). The 4X4 model gives the truck a good &quot;grip&quot; on snow covered roads. (Forget about getting angry with the snow plow driver for plowing you in...drive right through it!) 

One the few shortcomings of this truck is the poor gas mileage, especially in the winter months when cold starts and 4X4 is necessary. 4X4 pickups, especially with a v-8 engine weren't intended for economy, but I thought I'd just mention it.

Although the front seat is spacious and comfortable, the Club Cab bench seat is pretty impractical. It is handy for shopping bags and other smaller items, but isn't really designed for adults. My son's car seat is back there, with little room for much else.

Overall, a great truck. I love it. I especially love the V8, which gives you so much more of a &quot;sporty&quot; drive.<br><br>
