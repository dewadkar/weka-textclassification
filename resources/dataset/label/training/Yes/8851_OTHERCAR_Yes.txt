            We recently purchased a 2000 Honda Accord EX-L V6.  This top of the line incarnation of the best selling japanese car met all of our expectations.  The cars exterior is beautiful and simple in style.  It is pleasing on the eye from the front, sides or rear.  The interior is spacious compared to earlier Accord models with plenty of room for four or five.  The dash layout is convenient and having audio and cruise controls at the driver's wheel only adds to the ease of use.  All of the power functions you would expect are here.  What you may not expect is the very good climate control system and the power under the hood.  The climate control system in our model allows users to set the precise temperature desired for the car interior and will keep a constant temperature where you want it.  This takes some getting used to as the car decides when to turn on the fan, when to blow air or when to blow heat as necessary.  If you try to tinker, it lets you take over manual control.  It is quiet and does a great job keeping the occupants comfortable.  All instruments and controls are laid out nicely and there is plenty of storage.  Probably the biggest surprise is the V6 engine.  When we test drove these cars, we were clearly leaning towards the four cylinder as we didn't think it would make a big difference on driveability and due to the small savings in gas mileage.  However, the V6 in the Accord is considerably stronger an engine and is immediately noticeable if one has just driven the four cylinder.  The V6 is quick to respond when you want more power and has plenty to give.  In fact, the V6 really seems to give the car a sports car acceleration and power that is nice, even for my wife - who likes to know that the ability to take off is there if she needs it.  The car also handles slightly better, undoubtedly due to the larger wheels used on the V6 model.  All in all, a tremendously fun and stylish car to both own and drive.  We have thus far had no mechanical issues with the car and do not expect to.  Highly reliable and a great value, I would completely recommend this car to anyone considering buying it.
