            I bought my 1997 Sunfire SE in early 1998.  It had about 40,000KM (about 25,000 miles) all highway, when I got it.  It was in very good shape and highly maintained.  I enjoyed the style of it quite a lot...but wanted the GT for the 2.4L dual cam engine...rather than my 2.2L.  I quickly customized it and now it looks very good...and have had lots of offers on it.  I have been completely unimpressed the lousy GM 2.2L however.  I admit that I have not been the easiest on my car (frequently running it up to redline :) ...but never to the rev limiter).  I have raced it at our local drag strip (in Calgary, AB CAN) and was happy with how much it stomped on many tuned Honda's, Toyota's, etc.  I have now moved to Denver since...and noticed the extra 1500feet of elevation has really hurt my performance.  All and all the car has done well.  HOWEVER, I have noticed a few things that have gotten my upset.  I have noticed a increasing valve tick that is very noticible in colder weather.  Also the clutch is getting weak (it has 45,000 miles now).  As well...my 5 speed is starting to get a notchy feeling between 2nd and 3rd.  My friend recently bought a 1998 GT and has had the same problem.  In fact his is so bad that he feels the transmission will need to be replaced in under a year.  Otherwise my car runs very well...and has been very reliable EVEN IN CANADIAN WINTERS!!!  BRRR  :)<br><br>
