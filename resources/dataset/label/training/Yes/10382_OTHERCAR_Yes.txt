            First let me say that having sold cars for a living KIA are good economical cars. They aren't fancy. They are however dependable. The car handles good, gets good gas mileage, and good power for a 4 cylinder. I would recommend this car to parents as a first car for the kids. (I would not recommend a trend I have seen buying sports cars for teens)I would also recommend this car to people who need a car for long commutes to work. This car is no Toyota Camry but it doesn't have the price tag of one either.(Toyota quality isn't what it used to be, but that's another review)This is a car for those who need cheap dependable transportation. <br><br>
