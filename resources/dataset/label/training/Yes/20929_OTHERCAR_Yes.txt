            While vacationing in Las Vegas, I had the chance to drive a PT Cruiser for six short days.  It was the Limited Edition with Chrome rims.  The experience was memorable.

Of course, what everyone loves about this car are the looks.  It is gorgeous inside and out.  Clearly, Chrysler knows how to build an attractive car, and I have to say that this car is probably one of the most beautiful that I have ever seen.  

Enough gushing.  The design allows for a plentiful amount of interior space.  I found the driving position to be very comfortable, and an adequate amount of storage space.  All of the interior controls are well placed, attractive, and functional.  The car was also devoid of any interior noise after about 10,000 miles on the odometer.  The interior materials seemed luxurious, and was a surprise for a Chrysler product.  The sound system was merely adequate.  The A/C system was able to keep up with the killer 115 degree heat of Vegas.

Handling was pretty good, and the ride was smooth enough.  Overall this was turning out to be a great car, except that damn engine and transmission.  The engine is well underpowered for this car.  Stop and go traffic and acceleration to highway speed was laborious.  The transmission didn't help, as it was sometimes very abrupt.  Engine noise was prevalent.  Clearly, this car needs a 6-cylinder in order to make this a great car.

The attention you get in this car is unbelievable.  At least ten people actually came up to the car to comment on it.  If the engine and transmission were better, I would definitely consider this for my next car.  For now, I need something with a little more pep.<br><br>
