            The 97-99 GMC Yukon, which is pretty much the same as the Chevy Tahoe 97-99, is a real prize to own.  It is rumored that the Yukons run better though due to the open grill design, allowing more air to the cooling system.  An obvious advantage.

I have a 97 GMC Yukon SLT 4x4 - loaded, with all the bells and whistles.  It has been a wonderful rig and has always completed all tasks for me in an efficient manner. 

It hauled 3 people from Washington to Oregon with 700lbs of camping gear in back, including a large stereo system.

It always made those home improvement trips to Home Depot a cinch with it's large cargo area and convenient barn doors.

It NEVER struggled at pulling people out of the ditch, even large FORD trucks.

It does all this, and still, underneath it's rugged abilities lies the great luxury of the leather seats, digital compass, CD player (amazing 8 speaker system), and cruise control. 

You can't go wrong with this vehicle.  As long as you have a need for it.  Sometimes it feels like a chore to drive, as it is so big, and doesn't really have impressive gas mileage.  But, with the style and luxury, you will feel like a king, or queen.

Safety is another plus.  Driver and passenger airbags.  Just the size of this thing is protection enough.  I was hit by a drunk driver trying to commit suicide.  It did $14,000 of damage and spun us around 3 times on the freeway, but hey, all I had was a small cut on my arm from a piece of glass.  As you can see, I really feel safe in this vehicle.  I vowed never to drive a car, because I was scared of an accident... until I researched the Passat, which you should read my review on as well. 

Bottom line, if you have a need, the Yukon will be there for you.
