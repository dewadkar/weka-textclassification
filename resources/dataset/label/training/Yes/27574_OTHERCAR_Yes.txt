            My car is the butt of so many jokes with my family and friends and auto parts employees because of it's small 1.3 engine and complete inablility to accelerate quickly. 

Despite all this, I must recommend this car to other college students, such as myself, as a cheap and economical way to get from point A to point B.  Even though my car is an automatic, I've found on several occasions that it can easily get 44.3 mpg on the highway (provided you go not over 70mph).  More often then not though, it's about 31 mpg for city, and 38 for highway with an automatic.  Manuals will get much better mileage.  Another good thing about it is that it is relatively cheap to fix.  The parts for the car are generally small, and therefore cheaper then what you would have to pay buying parts for a Ford Mustang, obviously.  I myself, haven't had to buy many parts for my Metro, as it has held up very well the past 5 years.  The only major problem I've ever had with it, was when a rotor rusted on a few months ago and when the valve that brought condensed water from my air conditioner inside my vehicle instead of outside.  However both problems, though annoying, were quickly fixed without the divine intervention of an expensive mechanic.  

I could not recommend this vehicle to anyone that is looking to haul friends, co-workers, family around in it, or is interested in comfort, because a Geo Metro's ride is bumpy and cramped in the back at best.  However, if you are a college or high school student in need a cheap car that's very reliable to get you around town or campus in until you graduate and make enough money to buy a RX-7 (heh), this vehicle I HIGHLY recommend.
