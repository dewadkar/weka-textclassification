            I must admit, I the GS 300 turns heads wherever it goes. It is a beautifully designed car with flowing lines.  It posseses a little of everything; from a family car that mom can drive to a sporty sleek car racing on the highway with enough power to hold its own. It seems as though the Lexus engineers and designers took all the best qualities BMW five series and Mercedes, and added a touch of style and technology to create the perfect car..  
With such great qualities, what could possibly deter the GS300's image?  Let me tell you, it has nothing to do with the car itself. No, not at all.  Actually, what takes away from this car is the service.  Although you make walk into most Lexus dealers and be greeted with a smile and all the amenities you could possibly imagine, what occurs behind the scenes is unimaginable for the price we would pay for service.  At almost every 5,000 miles you are required to bring your car in for service, dish out 500 bucks and drive away without a complaint.  What really occurs, is you end up with rotated tires, maybe a new pair of wipers, and if you are lucky (and I mean really lucky) you may even get an oil change.  Total cost......less than $100.  In the meantime, you have Lexus mechanics doing side jobs with a filter that should have been put into your car, but instead he brushes off your old one and puts it back in the car...  

Bottomline, be cautious..........
