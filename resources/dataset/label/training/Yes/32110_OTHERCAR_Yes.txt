            I bought my 300M in January of 2000.  My previous car was an Infiniti J30.  What I really liked about the J30 was the service provided by my Inifini dealer (Scottsdale Infiniti) and the reliability of the car.

My 300M has performed flawlessly for over a year.  I like the styling of the car and it has a comfortable, relatively quiet ride.  The leather seats are comfortable and I like the fact that I can 'save' my seat and window settings.  So, when I get the car washed and they move the seat and move my side mirror windows, I can reset them to my settings with a touch of a button (nice feature).  The keyless entry system seems to be a bit touchy.  I am not sure what causes this, but sometimes I have to push the unlock button several times before I can get the door(s) to unlock (same thing with the trunk).  This is not a big problem, just a bit of an inconvenience (plus the Infiniti keyless entry always worked perfectly).  Yes, I have changed the batteries in the remote several times.....

The reason I purchased the car was: the low price relative to the Infiniti Q45, Lexus and Acura.

The car's engine performs well and has good, smooth acceleration.

The 300M styling is so much better than older Chrysler models, plus I love the white dials (speedometer, etc.).
