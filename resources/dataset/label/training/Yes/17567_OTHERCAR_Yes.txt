  We bought our Tacoma new six months ago. The mileage is now at
  17,769. It has been a very dependable. It is four cylinder,
  x-tra cab, automatic.
  Features I like:
    1.fuel cap cover opens and closes with key, making it almost
      impossible to forget to screw the fuel cap on.
    2.if lights are left on when exiting a warning sounds. This has 
      saved us having to charge the battery on several occasions.
    3.rear-mirrors provide good visibility.
    4.seats have good adjusting qualities for comfort.They can be
      adjusted to a reclining position(very beneficial for long
      trips).
    5.front and rear bumpers are extended to provide protection.
    
  Not pleased with:
    1.gas mileage.This is my biggest complaint.I expected much better
      mileage from four cylinders.(about 19 mpg)
    2.I prefer more padding in seats for comfort.
    3.odometer is not calculated in tenths of mile.Does not have 
      feature that allows you to calculate from one point to the
      next.
    4.cabin noise factor could be improved.

  I would recommend the Toyota Tacoma to those who want a dependable
  PU truck without luxury features. However, I am not satisfied
  with the gas mileage.<br><br>
