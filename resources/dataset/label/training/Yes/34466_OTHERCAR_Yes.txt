            The Chevy Metro is a great car.  I have owned my 1999 Metro for a little over a year, and, knock on wood, have never had a problem with it.  This car is perfect for me because I am a very small person (4ft. 11 in.) so I need a small car, and my seat is pushed all the way up to reach the pedals.  

I bought my used for the price of $8900.  This car is perfect for young people that are looking to buy their first car because of the price.  I've heard people call it a rollerskate with an engine because of the small shape.  It isn't very roomy for a tall person but for a more petite person, it is great.  It is also not a good car to go on a long vacation because of the limited space.  

There are a few downfalls, such as the small gas tank, but what do you expect from a 4 cylinder.  You must also get an oil change EVERY 3000 miles or the car doesn't like to get up and go.  But maintenance is what keeps your car running!  

I love this car and I wouldn't trade it for the world.  I like to go bombing around running errands, and no parking space is too small for it to fit!  It is not a head turner like a Corvette or Camaro, but it gets me from point A to B just fine.  The stereo system is pretty good, but loud base can blow the speakers, and I also have a CD player in it.  I have A/C but that sucks the gas too much.  

I have had people stop me at the gas station to ask me questions about it, because they have heard good things about it, and I gladly recommend it to them.  I would recommend this car to anyone for its dependability and price.<br><br>
