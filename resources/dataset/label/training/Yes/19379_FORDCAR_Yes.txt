            I am 15 years old and my first car was my 1991 Ford Thunderbird. I bought it with 68,000 miles on it for a bargan $2,000. When i bought the car there was nothing wrong with it except the air conditioner seals had shrunk and I had to get them replaced. 

THE GOOD
I have never ridden/driven a car on the freeway or in town that rides as smooth as the T-Bird. Its McFurson struts (not sure if that is spelled correctly) work wonders on smoothing out the ride. The automatic shifs smooth and quick. And it gets decent economy (depending on how i drive 17-20 in town and 24-27 on the freeeway). After i got the A/C fixed, it blows some chilly air at you. And it takes hills (with 1 person in it) great. The rear wheel drive is great for peal outs on dirt roads, dont try on pavement, you might get a small squeak.

THE BAD
The A/C takes too much power from the car. You can really feel the engine hesitate when it turns on. No manual on the lower models?? Why not? The back seat is too small for me to sit in (im no short guy tho 6'2") I have no place to put my cup on the way back from lunch to school. My valves nock when i dont put high octane gas in it. My cloth seats dont breath at all so i had to put seat covers on so my shirt didnt stick to my back (I dont live in a high humidity climate ether 10-20% humidity usually). The last thing is personal but I wish it had a 5.0 in it.

THE UGLY
My head lights are getting yellowish and i need to replace them. 146 bucks for a pair and thats a deal!! I ran into a post at a gas station and broke my right front turn signal. I am a slacker, but not so much as to not change my own oil. The oil pan drain plug is at a 90 degree angle from the bottom of the pan which makes positioning the catch pan tricky busness. The oil filter couldent be in a worse place. I have to reach around the front part of the chassis and around some hoses to get to it. It sits as a 45 degree angle from the ground and it is right above a support so the oil drains and splatteres.

Its a great running car. Gets descent mialage but i just may get rid of it this summer for a Saturn if anybody is intrested in buying. Give me a holler on my email. Please let me know if you liked my first review. thanks.
