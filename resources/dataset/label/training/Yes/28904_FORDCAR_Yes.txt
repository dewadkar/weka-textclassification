            After having driven Ford Explorers both for personal use and for work, I have found it to be a competent vehicle with some exceptions. As a personal vehicle for day to day use, there are not many competitors that can match the Explorer for price, performance, and quality. The Explorer in four or all-wheel drive configuration rides well and handles well especially for a vehicle built on a truck chassis. 
Although the 5.0 liter V-8 offers the most horsepower and torque of the three available engines, it is not necessarily the fastest and definitely not the most refined. Its strong point is for towing the heaviest loads within the Explorer's recommended limits. For day to day use, the 4.0 liter overhead cam V-6 is a better choice. Coupled to a five speed automatic transmission, it accelerates faster, more quietly, and more smoothly than the V-8. The five speed automatic is geared so that the engine loses very little momentum between shifts. 
The Explorer is not without its limitations. As a police officer who has been assigned an Explorer, I have some reservations about its use for severe service. The agency that I work for also has Jeep Cherokees and a Land Rover Discovery in our fleet. Although our county is a suburban county in a large metro area, we have some mountain areas within our jurisdiction. That is where the Explorer is lacking. It is too softly sprung for a lot of our mountain trails. The four wheel drive system is too much of a compromise towards easy engagement and light duty use. Where the Cherokee is a more rugged vehicle for that application, the Explorer shines as a vehicle for inclement weather on improved roads. That makes it a great vehicle for taking the family skiing or towing sport boats.
The Explorer also has the edge in the braking department. The four wheel wheel disc brakes with ABS stop sure and straight with little or no noticeable fade. I have had an Explorer in high speed situations responding to emergency calls and the brakes stood up to the task quite well. 
Someone looking at an Explorer without any previous truck or SUV experience needs to remember that this is a truck based vehicle. While it is not a difficult vehicle to drive well, don't let its comfort lull you into a false sense of security. It does not handle like a sedan or even a station wagon. One needs to keep in mind its higher center of gravity, heavier weight, and truck based suspension. The added weight of the four or all wheel drive models change the vehicle's dynamics, albeit slightly.   <br><br>
