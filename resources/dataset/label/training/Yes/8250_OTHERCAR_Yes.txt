            The FujiFine Pix 2800 is a great camera with easy to use features. The exterior of the camera is very attractive with a silver aluminum case giving that high tech look. One of the greatest features is the 6x optical zoom that is impossible to find under the 300-dollar range. I purchased this camera from beachcamera.com for 279 bucks!

The picture quality is outstanding when there is great light conditions, especially outdoors. I was able to take near post card quality pics in the lower settings. Taking pics indoors is another story. Picture qualities greatly depreciate when indoors. When there is a low light condition, the auto focus didn�t work well, and the flash didn�t help either. The pictures were blurry and several attempts at various settings had to be made to take decent pictures. Also the electronic viewfinder was dim and took me a long time to use to.

Overall I have to recommend this camera because it is perfect for outdoor shots, long distant shots, and seems to have powerful features. You will need additional indoor lighting to take great indoor pics.
