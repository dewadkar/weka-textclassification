            If you are looking to buy a car, whether its a brand new or used, be sure to stop by and check out the latest Acura Integra.  As an Owner of a 98 LS Integra, I find my car to be one of the best and reliable at a very reasonable price of under $20,000.  Acura has one of the BEST warranties out there in the Auto industries.  With an amazing 50,000 unlimited rust-free warranty, its no wonder that more and more people are choosing Acura's over GM autos.  Don't get me wrong, GM are still reliable cars But according to statistic base on Consumer Report for year 1999, Acura and Toyota had far more fewer complaints than GM automobiles.  Among other leading low-complaints vehicles were makers such as Lexus, BMW, and Audi's.  Of course those autos will run more than $40,000 in your wallet, but if you have the money, why not buy or lease one and find out for yourself all the luxuries and special features at a touch on a button.  
One aspect i find Japanese autos better than GM auto is there customer service.  Over the past months I read couple articles in the Consumer report and Consumer Digest with response to the satisfaction of customer service.  GM Auto Industries were at the bottom of the chart, again with Honda, Acura, Lexus leading the poll.  
Acura has a top of the line racing style TYPE R, very limited edition that comes in yellow and black for the year 2000.  Its a very powerful 1.8L vetc/190 horsepower.  if you're a true racing addict, i recommend you check this out, if you can find one.  I know a lot of people have already placed orders at local dealers.  It'll run you in the mid 20,000 plus the high cost of insurance and parts.  The GSR is more of an average daily semi racing vehicle.  It also comes in 1.8 vetc but with 170 hps.
The LS comes in 1.8 non vetc/ 140 hps.
I am a full time student at U of Maryland and I must conclude that I have driven many sports cars under $20,000.  But if you really want a reliable car with lots of fun and excitement in its package, I highly recommend the Acura Integra.  You can't go wrong!<br><br>
