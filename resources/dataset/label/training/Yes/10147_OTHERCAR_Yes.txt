            I'm not much of an automobile expert so my review will be short and sweet. When looking for an SUV my wife and I were looking for a roomy, comfortable, sleek looking SUV. Many SUV's look bulky and are more like trucks. That is what some people exactly want. But we wanted an SUV that drove like a car and wasn't going to put us in the poor house.

The Pathfinder 2000 fit all our qualities. It is very comfortable with cushiony seats and is very roomy. Since we have a six month old, we wanted an easy drive without having to buy a luxury SUV. The ride is great and we didn't even buy the Luxury model. We bought the Sports model and are extremely happy with it. And of course, the look is very sleek and not bulky. 

Our only con would be that is was still a bit pricey even though we opted not to get the 4 X 4 model. Living in Northern California, we didn't really find a need for it.

Lastly, we are very happy with the Pathfinder. The gas mileage is better than expected. Our model is about a 16 gallon tank and will go comfortably about 300 miles before fill up. I would suggest that if you are looking for the same things that we looked for, you should stop at Nissan and take a look at a Pathfinder.<br><br>
