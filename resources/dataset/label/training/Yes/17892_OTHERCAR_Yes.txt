            All I can say about this car is wow.  This is absolutely the best car I have ever driven.  It has a perfect combination of quality, luxury, and class.  Yes, I realize the price is quite steep.  But remember you get what you pay for.  Acuras are known for their dependability and long lives.  For instance, my friend has a acura and it is still going after 225,000 miles and she bought it used.  This car is so smooth and fast that it could abosolutely be the car that makes you feel good to drive to the store one more time because you forgot to get something the first time.  Go out and get one.  Why not? You only live once! <br><br>
