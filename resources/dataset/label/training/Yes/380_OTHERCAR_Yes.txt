            I used to be a die-hard GMC fan....NOT ANYMORE!!

When you're 6ft 5in tall, it's hard to find a rig that fits, but I had no problem in the Xterra XE 4x4!  One thing I can't stand is a rig where my knees hit the dashboard when the seat is all the way back, but with the Xterra, I have plenty of leg room.  The other thing I hate is when my head hits the roof!  I had more head and leg room in the XE than I did in the SE model OR the Nissan Pathfinder, the Xterra's &quot;larger&quot; brother!  The SE is nice, but the back of my head was hitting the edge of the sunroof opening!  No way was I going to get something like that!  For most people though, the SE would be a great SUV and that comes with both a CD and tape player built into the radio!  The other things that the SE had over the XE is the &quot;pop-up sun roof&quot; which the salesman said &quot;you would need to take out the cargo basket for it to really be effective&quot; and side-body mouldings (which would be nice....no more door-dings!).

The XE I bought had several features.....the CD player and radio provides good audio for &quot;factory audio&quot; and it will be adequate for most people.  My XE came from Canada and has a few things that are not found on US models like day-time running lights, limited slip differential and get this.....a &quot;windshield washer fluid warning light&quot; that lets you know when the washer fluid is low!  TOO KOOL!! 

This SUV is very comfortable, easy to get used to and I love it!  So long GMC!<br><br>
