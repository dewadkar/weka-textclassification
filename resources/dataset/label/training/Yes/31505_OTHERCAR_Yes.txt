            My family has a 1988 Sentra which we bought some odd 13 years ago in Oregon.  (We also have an 1990 Axxess too)  The Sentra has lasted years of torture, and has maintained its composure inside out.  Cold winters have left freezing water on the paint for weeks, and chilling the poor engine for days, but it still keeps running.  The only dings that we have on it to this day are from my brother dropping a radio on the front right wheel fender, and one or two shopping kart dings on the side of the car.  But other than that the original Aspen White paint job is doing great.  There is only a small amount of rust forming, but none that has spread or can be seen extensivly.  I wash and the car often and waxing it brings out a very bright shine to the clear coat.

We got the very basic model Sentra which means that it does not have any AC or power windows or lighter or tachometer or anything extra.  But we do have a rear window defroster!!!  I think that this is the E16i engine and set up with the four-speed manual tranny.  Engine failures consist of having to replace the Mass Airflow Sensor replaced causing the car to jerk violently when 3k rpm's was reached (oh the reason why I know the rpm's is because I installed an aftermarket tack from autometer in it ($40.00)).  That costed $100 to replace through the junkyard, the labor is possible to do by yourself.  The car has low mileage on it when compared to the rest of the reviews here, 70,000 miles on it right now.  The clutch is begining to go so that will have to be replaced pretty soon.  I took the car into the shop and they said that the waterpump is going bad and they quoted it to be about $200 to replace, so I am also looking into doing that one by myself, because the pump itself is only $20.  Other than that the engine is good, only a little bit of oil leaks from the pan every now and then, almost neglegable.  

The interior is doing great, there is only one crack in the vinyl on the driver seat so far.  It is a great beach mobile too, since now we have moved over to Hawaii. :P  

As far as aftermarket mods.  I have done a bit.  K&N makes an Airfilter to replace the OEM filter, and lets more air in.  My local exhaust shop made a custom cat-back exhaust for me for about $250 including labor.  That is, 2-1/4 in piping, and a 3 chamber flowmaster exhaust with a tip from Checkers autoparts.  Intrax can drop your 88 Sentra for about $160 and will put it closer to the ground by 1-3/4 inches.  Enough to make the car look better even with the 13 inch stock rims on!  Performance with these lowering springs is great, cuts the body role down in half, and does not kill your ride comfort.  Still very smooth ride.  With these upgrades and tint, the car will perform even better than stock, look very nice, and make an exhaust note that is deep, and not hollow like so many other cars.  As I read in the manual for the Sentra, this car puts out a whopping 73 hp.  However, it can keep up with many of the car out there in the road today.  It is very light, just 2,280 Lbs.  So that means a very respectable power to weight ratio.  That explains the good acceleration.

I love this car, and encourage you to buy one too.  Up-keeping the car is good and it will never die.
