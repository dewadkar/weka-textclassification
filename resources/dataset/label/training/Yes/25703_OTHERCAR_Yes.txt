            We bought our 1995 Pathfinder SE V6 4x4 brand new.  We looked at practically every type of SUV and decided on the Pathfinder mostly because of what we got for the money.  It now has just about 70,000 miles on it and we have had some problems but they were relatively minor.  
We opted for the manual transmission simply because we like shifting for ourselves.  We haven't had any problems at all with the transmission. 
When we first got the Pathfinder, we had to take it in 2 or 3 times because the keyless entry and alarm system was malfunctioning.  We blame service for not getting it right the first time. 
At 24,000 miles, we had to get four new tires.  Our car has always had minor alignment problems and service never can get it perfectly aligned.  We got the new tires and keep our eye on the alignment...we have the same tires that we got back at 24,000 miles.  We think Nissan just put on cheap tires initially.
At 35,000 miles, the odometer and speedometer quit working.  We got it replaced under warranty.
At 65,000 miles, the engine was making a hideous clicking noise, especially on acceleration.  We took it in and it needed a new manifold.  Nissan told us that 95 Nissans tend to have the manifolds go out.  At the time, they were replacing them for free if it was within the 5 years form the original purchase date.  Well, we were 2 months past that but they did it anyway.  We have learned that there are great Nissan service departments and then there are really bad ones.  The service department where we bought our car was horrible.  The one we use now is great.  You just have to shop around, if you can.
We have also had really minor problems with interior stuff.  The horn and the lighter both stopped working...easily fixed.
Overall we love the Pathfinder.  It has been such a comfortable ride for our many road trips (we are a family of four). In town, however, the V6 engine isn't quite powerful enough for our taste.  It does get pretty good gas mileage, though.  It is very reliable and a nice car to drive.
