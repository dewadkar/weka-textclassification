            My first experience with driving a Chevy Lumina was in a driver's education class 10 years ago.  At that time, I thought the Lumina was a really sporty car (I was 15 at the time!), but it wasn't the best to drive.  After driving the 2000 Lumina extensively, I can say that it is on par with the other import cars in a similar price range today.

The first things you'll notice in the Lumina are the comfortable seat and control panel set-up.  I found it difficult at first to determine whether or not my headlights were on because sometimes they come on automatically, other times not.  Sometimes they shut off automatically when the car is off, other times not.  

There is a very sturdy feel to the steering and maneuvering in the Lumina.  I have to admit that I had trouble a couple times keeping up with a friend whom I was following in a new Lincoln.  The pick-up is not the greatest, but the size of the auto makes you feel quite secure.  I am used to driving an Escort, so the Lumina seems like a beast in comparison.

If your Lumina comes loaded, you really couldn't ask for more.  Power locks and windows, a nice sound system and a roomy backseat will get you from point A to point B in comfort.  While the Lumina doesn't have a very distinctive body design, it is smooth and classic-looking.  If fuel economy is a priority, stick to economy cars.  If you are ready to graduate to a bigger car and can do without the sticker shock of the imports, the Lumina is the car for you.
