            I bought my 93 Grand Cherokee mainly to tow our boat and camper.  It has turned out to our most used and dependable daily driver.  It is the Laredo model equipped with a 5.2 liter V-8, automatic transmission, and full time 4WD.

In over a 110,000 miles of driving we have had no real problems with the Grand Cherokee.  Other than routine maintenance, the only unusual expense has been with front brake pads and rotors but I suspect that this is due to towing our boat which weighs over 5,000 lbs. and the camper which is a 30' model and also heavy (don't really know the weight).

This is not a really large car inside but 5 adults can ride in reasonable comfort.  With the back seat folded down you can stack in some larger items but it is not a pick-up by any means.

In around town driving and when towing the gas mileage is pretty bad; but on trips when not towing I usually average 23-24 mpg which is impressive for a 4WD vehicle.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for SUV that is capable of towing most anything you want to hook up to, is pleasing in appearance, and in my experience extremely reliable.<br><br>
