            This is one of the first products I have struggled to find a criticism for.  We bought our camera almost a year ago, from Best Buy, and at the time I think we paid $450 for it.  In the meantime, I have taken hundreds of pictures and never had a complaint.  The are a number of automatic modes, but I mostly use the manual mode and edit my photos on my computer.  In my limited experience with the automatic presets, they have all worked as advertised, always giving crisp, clear pictures with great color.  I have seen no wash-outs, no spots of fading definition, no nothing that would indicate sub-par performance.

Battery life is superb - I often go a week or two without charging the battery (assuming a couple dozen photos a week)and the convenient wall charger (it plugs in an outlet and is about as big as a cassette) makes quick work of the battery if I do.  I expect a full day of shooting would be no problem, assuming you have the memory cards to do so.  I can fit 22-25 pictures on a 32MB card, setting the camera at the second-highest setting (I'm not sure what the pixel rate is at that setting, but the pictures look great at 1280 x 1024).

The camera looks good, too.  I don't suppose that matters much, but people like the look of it and frequently ask what kind of camera it is.  When you're not shooting, a faceplate covers the lense, eliminating the need for a lense cap, and it's nice to be able to view your photos without having the lense poking out from the camera's otherwise slim profile.

Like I said, I have no complaints.  I have yet to find the need for any accessories, and the only complaint I could think of is that on occaision the flash delivers mixed results.  One time it may be just right, and the next a little dark, but even then the image preview allows you time to know if it's right before you lose the shot.

It's a great camera - I have had nothing but good luck with Canon products and this one is no different.
