              This was my second Subaru purchase.  We upgraded from the Impreza AWD Wagon to the Outback AWD Wagon early in 2000.  The Impreza made us loyal Subaru customers and so far the Outback has done nothing to change our minds.  First of all the AWD (all wheel drive) system is fantastic.  I have gone as far as taking this car into a snow covered parking lot and tried to get it to spin out.  I couldn't do it!  Combine the AWD with antilock brakes and you've got one mean winter driving machine.  The dual airbags are comforting knowing that not everyone on the road has the traction that you do.  Some of the interior features are great while others are lacking a little.  I never thought I'd like heated seats but they are great.  Heated mirrors also come with the cold climate package and are of much use.  Being an American, I found some of the controls for interior features took a little getting used to.  The gauges are well located and easy to read.  The am/fm CD player is average.  The auto shift transmission feature is nice but really not needed.  The interior room is good for a family of four and there's enough room for Rover behind the rear seat.  However, this car does not have the storage/cargo/people room of a SUV.  Exterior features include fog lamps, remote entry and roof rack making it rather stylish.  The engine is smooth as silk and powerful enough to merge onto the freeway without fear.  The four speed auto is nice and smooth also.  The suspension is very tight giving you a feeling that you are glued to the road.  The car will do 120 mph if you want it to.  This car is a great value for a small family especially if they live where the snow falls.  Also, if you want a Volvo or Audi but don't have $50,000 laying around, this is your car. <br><br>
