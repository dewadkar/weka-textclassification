            I have only recently purchased the Dimage7I, haveing read a number of reviews comparing it to it's predecessor the 7, and the problems that had been designed out. My previous digital camera was a Nikon coolpix 880, and after a year of use, decided to change to the Minolta 7I. Once you have used a SLR camera of the old type film camera,all cameras are judged by this format. The Dimage's electronic viewfinder, with its horizontal/vertical mode, is so comfortable to use that you can dispense with the power hungry LCD screen for composing pictures, and shoot totally with it. I only use the LCD screen for reviewing what I have taken. Shooting outdoors in bright sunlight is a dream. The camera is extremely ergonomic and fits into the hand, if you are right handed, like an extension of your arm. I found it very fast to use when taking moving subject shots, like birds at close range, approx one to two metres. Composition is so easy, as you have the eyepiece up to your eye, like a SLR camera, and your left hand winding the zoom in and out. The 28mm wide angle to 200mm telephoto has just got to be experianced to be believed.The various settings on the camera really need to be studied if you want to get the most out of it. I found the camera to be very user friendly, and a quick glance at the book to find out how to switch it on, gave me thirty pictures in a very short time, using standard setting, and just clicking off at any thing that caught my eye. I purchased a 128mb flash memory card with the camera, and this gives, at standard setting, 120 pictures. If you really want to get storage with high resolution shots, then a Microdrive up to 1gb can be used. I got a set of NMH rechargeable batteries, of 1850 ma/hr capacity and a quick charger, with the camera. This is absolutley necessary as a lot of power is used.It pays to get a spare set, as it takes about four hours to charge the batteries from fully discharged. I have an Olympus OM2 SLR, and the filter thread is 49mm, so all the various filters can be used with the MInolta. I like the way the lens stays put when you switch on, and doesn't pop in and out, as zoom is manual, and would be awkward if it was power driven by another button. There is a seperate hot shoe for off camera flash. This means you can use bounce flash for portrait and simulated natural light shots.There is also a really satisfying sound effect of a SLR shutter going off, that is taken from a SLR Minolta, the Dynax/Maxxum 9, or you can turn it off.It weighs in at 525g,or 18.5oz, and is a nice comfortable feel on the supplied neckstrap. For a 5 megapixel camera the price is very reasonable, approx $A2000 around Melbourne in October 2002, and the beauty of it is you can be up and running, straight from the box with all the bits and pieces included, after the batteries are charged up. An AC Adaptor is needed for downloading to a computer. I only take pictures for my own pleasure, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder.If you can fault this camera, then you are looking for something that is not there yet.
