            Now that the battle of the megapixels has gone to the 3+ level, the Olympus 2020 is an excellent value. I've been watching the prices and I recently bought a brand new 2020 on e-bay for $565. Not a bad price for a camera that was selling for just under $1000 a few months ago.

I've been using the camera for a few weeks now and I must admit that I'm really impressed with it. You really can get an 8x10 print on a reasonably decent printer. (I also just got a Canon BJC-3000 - watch for my review on that). The 8 meg smart media card that came with the camera will hold over 80 pictures using the lowest quality setting. That's perfect if you're going to use the photos on the interet. I just did a portrait using the highest quality setting and the 8x10 prints looked great! Very sharp, lots of detail.

One of the features that I find a bit bothersome is the placement of the zoom control button. It's built into the shutter release so you can't zoom and quickly shoot. Another annoying issue is the fact that there is a short, but noticable, delay in the time from the instant you press the shutter button until the flash goes off. I've missed several action shots because of that.

All things considered - it's an excellent camera and you can get it at a very reasonable price.<br><br>
