            I absolutely love this camera!  I carry it everywhere I go!

At 1.3 mega pixels, this camera is somewhat outdated already, but even with such small resolution it takes great pictures.  Many of my friends have purchased Olympus cameras after seeing the pictures that mine produced.

My favorite aspect of this camera is that is it small enough to carry in my pocket and keep with me all of the time.  It is extremely durable as it gets bounced around in my bike bags, thousands of miles per year (including some off road rides), and get tossed in my backpack (where it has gotten wet), stuffed in my pocket, and dropped onto a curb and bounced into the sand.  Through all of this, it still takes great pictures and works flawlessly.  The only thing that's happened is that the view screen on the back is ever so slightly misaligned now.  The misalignment of the screen is not a problem though.

I use the rechargeable batteries that came with it, and by using the viewfinder more than the screen I can go a few weeks between recharges.  During the recharge cycle I pop in the lithium batteries that also came with it, and they're still going strong.

I've put a 128 MB memory card in it, and it now holds 566 pictures at the standard resolution & compression.

After all of the nice things I've said, there are still a few negative things, but they are minor enough not to bother me:

1) The biggest one is this... when closing the sliding clamshell cover, it can be pushed into the lens as it is trying to retract.  When others try to close the camera they always try to force it and I jump and yank it away from them. :)  You have to be very careful when closing the camera and wait for the lens to retract.  The newer cameras have resolved this issue.

2) You *MUST* use the flash.  Always.  No exception.  The newer models seem to have recognized this and the flash pops up automatically when you open the camera.

3) The screen refreshes VERY SLOWLY when viewing/zooming/panning your stored pictures.   Again, the newer models are much faster.

Overall, if you're on a budget, you can't go wrong with this camera.  4x6" prints from CostCo & Wal*Mart have come back and they are to the unaware casual observer as good as those from my SLR.  If you have the funds, consider the higher end Olympus cameras.  Friends of mine have purchased these higher end models after seeing mine and have been equally happy.  I will almost definitely be buying Olympus when I feel the need to upgrade.
