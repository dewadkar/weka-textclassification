            This is the best car made. I only go to the dealer to get an oil change.  Over at the dealer the treat me like a king.  They give you everything. First of all my car has every option on earth. Anything you name it has.  I am surprised the car doesnt fly thats the only thing it cant do.  I Picked a manual transmission instead of a automatic because it is fun.  All of my friends are switching to lexus.  They currently own car like caddilac, Audi, and honda. Those are also great cars but they have had several problems.  My car is very quick andd responsive.  ANd it is dead quite..  There is nothing more to say except that it is the best!!
