            I don't know....I always associated oldsmobile with something my grandmother would drive.  Not anymore.  We rented an Alero while vacationing in Florida and I fell so in love with it I have to say I would buy one if I were in the market to buy a new car.  It's stylish, sporty, very very comfortable ride, hugs the curves, great gas mileage and pretty decent trunk space.  We were able to put two full size suitcases and some carry on bags within no problem.  The interior is well though out and spacious. Before you buy a comparable car to the Alero test drive one, you may be sold like I was.<br><br>
