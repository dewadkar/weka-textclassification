            Having sold Nissan marine products for many years, I came to love Nissan's performance and reliability.  In early 1999, I purchased a used (clean) Nissan Altima GXE.  I bought it from a reputable local car dealer and purchased a 4 year extended warranty for $1200.00  The car had a window price of $12,995, but drove it off the lot after three days of negotiation for $10,000 even.

I don't baby this car, but I don't abuse it either.  I maintain it well only missing a couple Nissan suggested service schedules that I feel are probably a profit pitch for the local dealer.  I change the oil religiously every 3000 miles and have a system check performed every 6 months or so.  I maintain the exterior finish with a teflon polish which keeps a showroom shine on my Alty.  

I love the acceleration the 150hp powerhouse allows.  Some may say this car is sluggish, I simply can't see how... if you know how to drive, there is plenty of power to unleash. (note: all this even with an auto transmission). The engine is both smooth and responsive.  There is next to no vibration when stopped.  Engine noise is minimal for the most part unless you start tapping on 5-6K rpms.  Smooth transmission shifting especially when advancing into the two-stage overdrive.  This may take some people some time to get used to, but once you do it becomes one smooth running system.  My b/f drives a standard (SAAB) and drives ME nuts when he drives my car. I don't particularly care for the fuel economy of my Nissan.  It certainly doesn't break any efficiency records, that�s for sure.  I average about 19-24 mpg.  That�s a nice mixture of highway/city driving and I'll admit I like to pet all 150 horses from time to time.  The best part about my car - it's both dependable and reliable.  This car has me spoiled to death.  During the three years I've owned this car I've replaced a $9 air filter and a $50 battery (just recently replaced).  Both maintenance items probably not worth mentioning but it's ALL I�ve done to this vehicle.  I get excited just thinking about it having finally escaped an on-going Buick nightmare.  Besides my b/f's SAAB forces me to appreciate my Nissan repair history.  If it wasn't for his SAAB we'd be in that three story house in the nice rich-folk neighborhood on the other side of town with the in ground pool and sauna. I'm delighted to say I wasted $1200 bucks on an extended warranty and emergency towing plan that I've never had to use. Something that most people don't think about how easy it is to wash a car. The Nissan Altima's design must make it the easiest car to wash/wax.  Some things you're gonna strongly dislike: poor drink holder design (small and blocks radio controls - if you wanna visit the drive-thru don't supersize it and you might as well turn the radio off), velour seats that every particle on earth sticks to (break out the commercial vacum - I don't have a pet but can't imagine the nightmare putting one in this car would create), poor turning radius (it's more like a boat than a car in a parking lot - but you get used to it pretty quick), small rear entry and seating (don't put big momma in the backseat or you gonna have a big problem on your hands). If you can live with those minor flaws then you should not hesitate purchasing this vehicle.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
