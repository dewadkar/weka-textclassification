            My first car out of college is my trusty 1994 Honda Accord EX that I bought in June 30, 1994.  I got it for $20k, plus tags, doc, taxes, etc (thanks to bank of Mom and Dad).  I got the automatic, leather, floormats, and real wood dash stickers.  The other options I added afterwords were the Honda trunk mat and I added an Alpine 6 disc CD changer to fit with the factory head unit.  When I moved to LA I had my windows tinted with Lumar film.

I really like my car.  I like the color a lot and the car looks sleek.  My Accord is pretty much bone stock.  It's lived 3 years up the SF bay area and the last 2 years in LA.  It's comfy, reasonably fast, handles really well, reliable.  My mileage is okay 27 mpg mixed city and highway (including regular rush hour traffic jams) with A/C on all the time.  The factory radio sounds really good with the CD changer. I haven't had any reliability problems.  The only unfortunate thing is that the car isn't slightly larger for moving a lot of stuff.

I like this car b/c I can drive it hard in turns, on/off ramps.  I can hear the engine rev up when I step on the gas and it loves being driven between 70mph-80mph.  It drives like every other Honda I know.  It's easy to drive because it handles the way your mind thinks it should.  

I bought this car b/c I wanted to have a sporty looking sedan.  I wanted alloys, leather, and moonroof.  I chose this over the Camry b/c my grandmother has one and over the Nissan Maxima b/c I didn't like the styling.  Plus the Accords were new for 1994 and they had the Sherwood Forest Green Pearl color which I like a lot.

Right now I'm at 113k miles and it still runs like new.  I've just been thru the 90k timing belt/water pump replacement/tune up.  

I've been in one accident and the repair shop did a really good job.  I've had the wheels aligned once after the accident.  The radiator cracked at 85K miles.

I've had some quirky things break.  The door handle seals on the right side of the car were &quot;peeling&quot; and those were fixed under warranty.  There was a knocking/ringing sound at 1800 rpm that was also fixed under warranty.  The HVAC control knobs were replaced once under warranty b/c they broke and I've recently repaired them b/c they are now out of warranty (a little epoxy and two zip ties will go a long way).  Also the aftermarket wood dash trim is warped, cracked and faded from the sun.

Right now my lights in the vent selector don't work and and in my radio preset buttons don't light either.  My fuel gauge only works between 3/4 full to empty.

The only thing that is peculiar about maintaining the car is that the rear breaks wear out at 22.5k miles.  Doesn't that seem too soon?

Even after all that, the car still seems to drive like it is new.<br><br>
