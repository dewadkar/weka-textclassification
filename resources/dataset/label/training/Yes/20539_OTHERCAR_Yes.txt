            I owned a 1999 Acura Integra GS for a little under a year, until it was stolen in front of my apartment in Los Angeles, CA.   The car proved to be reliable and solidly built.


Appearance--

The Acura Integra is sleek and sporty.  The standard Integra comes as a two-door hatchback, although I have seen a couple of four door versions on the roads.  The car is slanted, and appears almost wedge shaped.  Overall the car gives off a sporty look without being overtly aggressive.  

Interior--

The overall interior height of the car is a bit short even in the front two seats.  I am about 5'10 and my head was near the top of the roof.  Rear spacing was almost an impossibility for any one around 6'0.  There is almost no headroom, and to compound matters there was very little legroom between the seats.  The hatchback "trunk" area was slightly smaller than what I had hoped for, but it could adequately hold the weekend luggage for two.

The two front seats were great for drives under two hours.  Any long trip in the car, which I made several, resulted in me constantly trying to reposition myself in a seat that I could never get to feel just right.  There are also two rear seats in the back, but my limited experience with them, leaves me with an inability to comment on their comfort.

The features in the car included a sunroof, power locks and windows, and a 6 speaker CD player.   The CD was adequate, but could use improvements in sound volume and clarity.  I also did not splurge the extra cash for the leather seats, but rather settled with the cloth interior.  The cloth seats proved to be great except for their horrible neon color designs.  



Performance--

The Integra GS comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder unit that produces140 horsepower.  Although this is no power demon, it usually proves adequate.  The biggest disappointment in the car is that most consumers would except more from a car designed to look sporty.  I know there are additional models that could bump up horsepower and torque, but that adds an additional price.  I feel the base model should have come with more power.  

One of the most shocking delights of the Integra was its ability to drive in any weather condition.  The Integra is a front wheel drive vehicle, that is easily able to drive through snow and almost anything else that comes in its path.  The Integra handled inclement weather better than any other non all-wheel car I have ever driven.  

The small frame of the car also allowed it to make turns and corners with little deceleration.  The Integra is no racecar, but it will handle most peoples every day driving with pleasure.

Other points�

I think it is worth mentioning that I drove this car very hard for the year that I had it, and I never experienced any problems with it.  I accumulated almost 28,000 miles on the car in a little under a year, and really the only thing I ever had to do was change the oil.  The Integra always felt strong and ready to go.  The engine always sounded the same as the first day I drove it off the lot.  The Integra really felt like it would drive for a long time to come.

On a sad note, it is also important to remember that Acura�s and Honda�s are stolen a lot.  (The cars are usually stolen for their parts since so many year models are interchangeable) The only alarm system on the car was on the CD player.  I think all Acura�s�since they are luxury version of Hondas�should come with a standard anti-theft alarm system.
