            I really like my Dodge Caravan SE. It's a great vehicle. It was the first brand new car my wife an I ever bought.

<b>What do I like:</b>

It's been great for moving stuff around - lots of cargo space when you take some seats out.

It's great for travelling with our baby (now 10 months old). His car seat attaches to the UAS (aka LATCH) brackets very easily.

All the controls are easy to reach and they light up quite well at night.

We bought it with an extended warranty that covers just about everything. I two years of ownership, I've only paid $40 (CDN) for a tire rotation. That's the only maintenance I've paid for.

Having a conversation at highway speed is a little difficult, but not impossible. It's a pretty good vehicle for interior noise levels.

<b>What don't I like:</b>

The fuel consumption. Come on folks, it's 2002. Why can't cars use half the fuel they did 10 or 20 years ago? If I had to buy a new car today, I would be heading for the Toyota Prius. It's not as roomy as the Caravan, but it uses a lot less gas.



Overall, I might buy one again, but it would have to be a lot better on fuel consumption
