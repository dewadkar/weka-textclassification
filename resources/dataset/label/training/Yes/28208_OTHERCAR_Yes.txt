            My husband decided to trade in his car and fell in love with the Dodge Durango.  Although it is rather expensive whether you are leasing or purchasing, it is well worth the money.  I drive an old jeep and really appreciate the feel of stability on the road.  The Durango has these same qualities as it is on a truck frame rather than a car frame.  This gives you the feeling that your tires are firmly on the road in any kind of weather or traffic conditions.  This is also a good safety feature as the Durango scored very well in crash tests, both head on and corner tests.  Much higher than many other SUV's which are on the lighter car frames.  The only ones that could compare are the Lexus SUV and other way more expensive models.
The Durango tends to be a gas hog, about 17 miles per gallon, but drives like a dream.  You can get the optional third seat which holds two people and is a full seat, not a jump seat.  My kids love it because they are not all squished together in one seat.  There are many &quot;goodies&quot; that come standard.  One of the extras is a separate air conditioner for the back.  This is a self contained system and does not run off the front system. There are cupholders galore and extra power plugs for things like cell phones and gameboys.  All in all the Durango is well worth the price.  I have a hard time even getting to drive it, my husband won't give it up!<br><br>
