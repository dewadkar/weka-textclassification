              My dad bought this car for me in 1993 and it was love at first sight! I have always been a Mustang fan and this car was a dream come true. Now grant it, it has been a few years and I had bought another car - BUT my other car is now gone and I am back to the Mustang until I find a new car I like enough to finance for five years!
  It still drives and runs great. The only wear and tear I've noticed is the hinges at the front that hold the roof down have rusted slightly. My dad told me that during rain storms, if you're driving, it leaks a little right in that spot. What can I expect from a car that is almost ten years old? I'll tell you what I didn't expect.
  I didn't expect that it would still run just as nice as it did the first day I brought it home. I also didn't expect the heat to kick right on. It is just as dependable as during my college days. The top still works and as long as you take care of it, it won't split or tear.
  I think this a great first car for a 16 year old simply because it is a convertible and it is safe. Mine has air bags and great brakes as well as comfortable seat belts. It doesn't get great gas mileage, but it will ALWAYS get you from point A to point B! One additional tip I should give is that the locks have a tendency to freeze up in the Wisconsin winters, below 20 degrees or so.
