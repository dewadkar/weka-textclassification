            I was one of the first to buy the new '91 Saturn SL2 while living in Orlando, FL.  I had been comparison shopping and had narrowed the choices down to the Mazda 626 and the Honda Accord.  Both were higher priced than the Saturn but a few things swayed me.

First, it is an American car (I know the others are made here, but they're really not American).

Next, they addressed some of the faults I saw in the others (I drove Honda's for years prior).  A real steel timing chain (no belt to break or replace).  Stainless steel exhaust system (most Honda's needed them replaced by 100,000 miles).  And other things as well.

I also loved the space frame and plastic exterior.  I had my first accident, since I was a kid, a couple of months ago, a little fender bender in a parking lot.  My car suffered only a little damage to the finish, nothing a little spot paint wouldn't fix.  The other car costing twice as much had serious damage costing thousands of dollars.

There are a couple of minor things that wore out a little early (interior components, none of them drivetrain related), but overall the car is in great condition.  It has way over 100,000 miles and still purrs like a kitten.

But that's my problem.  My wife and I agreed that I would get a new car as soon as this one starts having problems and becomes unreliable.  I've even been shopping around to get up to date on the new models, but at this rate, I'll have this one for years to come.<br><br>
