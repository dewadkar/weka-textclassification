            I lease a 1999 Ford Expedition, XLT , 4.6 L V8, with the optional third seat.  The truck is very roomy with easy access in and out of the front and back seats. Getting in and out of the third seat can prove to be a challenge to the average adult but great for kids.  Driving the vehicle is a pleasure with all the controls within reach and clearly visible.  The climate control system is good, with vents and controls available to passenger seated in the  rear. My vehicle is equipped with the 6 disc CD player.  The sound is good to very good quality with access to the changer
adequate.  The 4.6L V8 is a poor power source for this vehicle.  Compared to the G.M. equivalent, I am surprised Ford does not beef up it's small V8.  The exterior is sharp looking however the black plastic window trim tends to fade and discolor, not very attractive.  Overall the truck drives like a car.  The turning radius is tight and outperforms the much smaller Chevy Blazer. The Expeditions is smooth and responds well when in 4 wheel drive mode. <br><br>
