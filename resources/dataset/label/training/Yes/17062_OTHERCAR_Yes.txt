            For the car buff thinking about buying German, how might you choose between the BMW 3 series and the Audi 4 or my version-the Avant 2.6 (station wagon version)? Of course the companies give you a pretty useful lead, at least for those of you who took German 101- their slogans. Audi's slogan is &quot;Vorsprung durch Technik&quot; which means literally Advantage through Technology (or design) while BMW's is &quot;Freude durch Fahren&quot; which roughly translates to fun through driving.

How do they attempt to achieve these lofty goals in their car contraptions? Audi was the first car maker (at least in Germany) to fully protect their cars against rust, they of course introduced the racey 4 wheel drive version the Quattro, they produce the A8 and soon to be developed A2 out of aluminum and deliver cars with Porsches Tiptronic- the perfect solution for couples that fall on either side of the automatic manual shift fence. (also deliverable for the A4) So Audi is really good at technological innovation.

How does BMW help my fun level while driving? Ask a dealer and they'll say rearwheeldrive compared to the Audi's frontwheeldrive (or 4 wheel drive in the Quattro version), its perfectly balanced weigth distribution across the midesection of the car for better performance, the fact that they use lots of light weight alu parts for the suspension, the way the driver console is literally a console for the driver and wraps around the driver (very driver focussed! hard for passengers to monitor driver speed or exert downward tempo peer pressure) and the engine the engine! That's how they create Fahrfreude!

And of course they are right. If you compare the non Quattro version of the Audi with BMW, the Audi's steering just isn't as precise. If you have ever been to Germany and rented both cars and drive above the 120 Mph mark then the BMW feels like its on trainrails compared to the Audi's tendancy to wander ever so slightly. In the curves the Audi is much trickier to steer. But Snow what about snow conditions? Of course the dreaded Schwarzwald snow can reverse this scenario, making the BMW much more difficult to drive and there is very little Fahrfreude in a fender bender.

I'm no technical expert, but I much prefer the BMW's 6 cylinder engines to the Audi's. BMW has sound engineers that try to create the perfect engine sound for drivers and I think they've done an excellent job. The only problem I have with the BMW engine is with the 2 liter version in the first gear which you have to shift much too quickly for my likes. I also find the BMW much smoother at high speeds / revolutions which is also nice on speedlimitless routes. Audi horspower just doesn't measure up to BMW's even in the same doses. Who knows why?

So if that is my synopsis on Audi vs. BMW why am I an Audi man? The snow thing- can't beat an Audi Quattro in the snow and small design details on the new 3 bother me: things like the mirrored interior lights, the door handles that remind me of Windsor family ears, the inflated look its body now has etc. etc.<br><br>
