               For years I have owned 4-wheel drive vehicles.  Until recently I never even considered a car for driving.  That changed recently when I decided I wanted better mileage, smaller payment, and better performance.
   I had a Jeep before my Celica and it was not ready for my move to the mountains.  It just didn't have the top end for the mountain freeways.
   Enter the Celica.  I decided early on that I wanted to buy foreign.  I quickly narrowed my choices to the Celica, Eclipse, and Maxima.  I test drove a Maxima first, but it didn't excite me even though it was very powerful.  Next I drove the Celica and I was in love.
   I drove a 2000 Celica GT-S with Sportshift transmission.  That essentially is an automatic that you can switch into manual mode.  Shifting in manual mode is handled by push buttons on the steering wheel.

The Good:
   The high RPM engine is a distinct pleasure and I love the noise (this may be a problem for some).  I was giddy like a kid with the SportShift transmission.  A manual would be a good choice if you don't mind shifting in heavy traffic.  The fact of the matter is that the SportShift is an excellent option for only $600.
   The styling is awesome.  Some many cars these days go by the way of curvy shapes.  Where as Toyota sharpened the curves making this one nice car to look at.  The cockpit feel of the interior is perfect, but not very roomy (which I don't care about).  The controls are exact and firm.  And the sound system is stellar.
   The handling is out of this world.  I repeatedly take Clear Creek Canyon at 70-80 mph (not recommended) which is a very twisty mountain road.  It sticks to the pavement like glue and never complains.
   The braking is excellent.  I've had to slow down quite quickly in a turn going pretty fast and it doesn't twitch at all.

The Bad:
   Not much here to talk about.  The engine or transmission (I'm not sure) is kind of doggy when it's cold.  But look out when she warms up!
   Also another reviewer indicated the placement of the front cupholders which aren't really ideal.  With an automatic it's not such a big deal reaching around a big drink container.  But, I could see an issue with a manual.

Conclusion:
   This car was enough fun to convert me fully from the truck world.  It will provide me or anyone with a lot of fun for years to come!<br><br>
