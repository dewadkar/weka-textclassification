            In September of 1999, I was looking for a vehicle that would handle my lifestyle.  I attend college a few miles down the road, and I'm an active reporter for the local daily newspaper.  At the time, I had a 1988 Chevrolet Beretta with 152,000 well-earned miles, and it was time to get something new.

Now, I must say, I'm a 19 year-old male, and the SW2 didn't seem like the car for me at the time.  I mean, how many young guys would buy a wagon, and face the embarrassment of their friends?  Well, I guess that would be me.  When I got behind the wheel of my gold 1994 Saturn SW2, I was in love.

I truly enjoy the peppy 16-valve, Twin Cam four-cylinder found under the hood.  When hooked up to the five-speed manual transmission, which my car has, the car can really fly!  I like to zip around town, and my SW2 does the job nicely.  Plus, I like to do a bit of friendly racing from the stoplights.  Let's just say I've never lost.

Thus far, the car has been reliable.  It has only been in the shop for oil changes and regular maintenance.

Perhaps the most impressive thing about my car is the amount of miles it has.  I bought the car with 87,000 miles, and it now has 114,000.  Usually performance in a vehicle would trail off at these numbers.  Not so for my SW2.  It runs great.  Of course, it tremendously helps to get oil changes every 3,000 miles.  NO EXCEPTIONS.

Among all of my praises for the SW2, there are a few complaints.  My rear windshield wiper makes a funky squealing sound.  Another downfall for the rear wiper is the washer function.  It works, but not in the right direction.  I'm lucky if I can get a drop spilled on the window!  Another complaint is the automatic seatbelt lubricant.  If you get that stuff on your hands, it'll spread like wildfire.  Handling for the SW2 is good, but I've driven better.

My Saturn has treated me well, despite the small problems.  I would recommend an SW2, or any Saturn, to anyone looking for a quality, long-lasting vehicle.<br><br>
