            Let's face it. What guy wants to be seen in a mini-van? You know you need one. You know other type of vehicle fits your hectic lifestyle? Ah, but a sport utility can give me the utility I need and the rough image I quest, you say to yourself.  Is there a better alternative? 

I need to be macho and I need utility. Sport utilities ride like trucks. I like a smooth ride. Sport utilities suck gas. I want reasonable gas mileage. I recently achieved 27 MPG on a long trip. Four wheel drive is a waste of money when you face a few days a year with enough snow to use it. Add extra tire wear, more maintenance combined with less cargo room makes the Montana a more appealing choice. Rough exterior standard. Movable seats standard. Ego saving standard.

Take a look. I love mine!!<br><br>
