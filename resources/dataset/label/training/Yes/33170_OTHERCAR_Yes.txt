            After owning several Chevys and other domestic cars, I had had enough of expensive and frequent repair bills; it was time for a Honda!  I chose the Accord because it was larger than a Civic, looked good, and was considered a &quot;best buy&quot; and a very reliable car by almost every mechanic I talked to.

I bought the coupe because it looked more sporty than the four door models.  I bought mine in a Heather Mist color, and it is very pleasing to look at.  Mine is a 5 speed manual transmission.  After years of driving domestic 5 speeds, I couldn't get over just how easily the gears were to shift...it was like cutting butter with a steak knife!  

My 4 cylinder 16 valve has enough &quot;punch&quot; that I can quickly and comfortably pass slow moving vehicles.  The car handles quite well for its type (not quite as well as a sports car, but lets not compare apples and oranges).  Getting around in city traffic, and parking is a breeze, made easy thanks to its super smooth power steering.

Gas mileage is incredible (compared to some of my other cars) I only fill up once a week compared to 3 times every two weeks with my 1990 Chev. Cavalier.  I haven't had a mechanical break down of any kind yet in almost a years worth of driving one hour a day to work and back.  This cars engine is very quiet, making it quite relaxing to drive in.

There are a few things I've had problems with.  For one thing, these cars are plagued with wind noise problems (I read this in the lemonade guide) and my car is no exception.  I took it back to the Honda dealer almost a week after I bought it to have them seal the windshield with silicone.  This helped, but now my mouldings in the door are leaking air when I'm driving fast.

Other small problems include the rear end being too high, making it difficult to back out of (or into) tight spaces.  The rear view mirror seems just the tiniest bit too small, and the side mirrors don't quite move out as far as I'd like them to.

The rear seats fold down, but when they do, there is a &quot;V&quot;-shaped hole between the trunk and the rear of the car.  Often, it is difficult to put large objects through this constricted opening (eg. I tried to put an over-sized suitcase in the trunk, and it wouldn't fit through this hole, so I had to re-arrange the objects in my trunk in order that it could fit inside).

On my model, there is a small patch of padded cloth on the inside of the door just below the arm-rest.  This cloth is in a bad location because your feet will tend to kick at it when you're getting out of the car, and if the cloth is light-colored, it will get dirty FAST.

Oh yeah, one other REALLY bothersome negative, is the placement of the horn buttons.  The horn is not in the standard place in the center of the steering wheel, but is activated by one of two buttons on the sides.  These are VERY hard to locate when you are turning the wheel to avoid hitting someone, and want to toot the horn to warn them!  This is the one SERIOUS FLAW with this car.

Those few negative aspects are relatively insignificant compared to some of the other cars I've driven.  I rate my 97 Honda Accord Coupe as the best car I've ever driven, and I recommend it highly to anyone.<br><br>
