            My wife and I did a 4 year lease of our 1995 VW Jetta GLS (4 cylinder model with full electrics package, sunroof, 6 CD changer, and heated seats, stickered at $17,500) for around $230 a month.  It was an incredible value even though the warranty essentially ended at 24,000 miles.  We bought the car off of the lease in 1999 at what I considered a very fair price, $8100 after the deposit was deducted, but within a few months we wanted a new car and traded it in with 62,000 miles on it for $9500.  The Jetta did a magnificent job of holding its value.

The car never broke down, but we did have to take it in for some unusual service.  Other than general maintenance here is the list:  

At 27,000 miles the driver's front heated seat failed.  VW would not cover the cost of repair (appx $600) so we just left it at that.  It was a frill anyway.

At around 45,000 miles the lock on the driver's side door broke out, costing about $120 to fix at the dealer.

About 55,000 miles the driver's side window regulator failed, costing quite a bit of money to fix (I think it was around $250).  We were worried the passenger side's regulator was going to be eventually and thought about trading the car in at least, but we decided against it.  

Near the end we discovered that the air bag sensor was going out, which would have cost around $500 to replace.  That was when we decided to trade it in.

The original tires, the Goodyear Eagle GA's, lasted until 40,000 miles, when we replaced them with Yokohamas.  The Yokos were much better in rain and snow.  When we traded it in we were told the front and back brakes had about 20,000 miles of wear left on them.

The car's ergonomics were fabulous!  The driver's seat was easily adjustable and you could ride in a &quot;high&quot; mode.  The radio was high up on the dash where it should be (unlike the 1999 and newer Jettas where the radio is set much lower).  The back seats folded down so you could put large items through the trunk.  The engine had a lot of rev and speed for a 4 cylinder, even when the air was on.

A couple of quirks:  the engine always emitted a bit of blue smoke when starting, even from the beginning.  That was also a bit disconcerting, but it never changed in quantity and we never had an oil leak.  The 6CD changer (Clarion) malfunctioned on occasion, but always &quot;came back to life&quot; after some unplugging.  The CD changer was subjected to occasional skips on bad roads.  There was always a noise in the passenger side of the dash, a rattle.

The wells in the doors and the storage areas behind the front seats were good for putting things.  We didn't really miss a glove box.

I'm 6'2&quot; and was able to sit in the back seat with the front seats in the position that I would be in.  That was the biggest selling point for me.  I think I rode in the back seat once, but I had my parents and siblings to think about!

Gas mileage was always consistent and excellent.  It was EPA rated 31 highway, 24 city, but we always got at least 30 in city driving, 45mpg on 55mph highway driving, and 34mpg at 70mph interstate driving.

We had a good dealer where we bought the car (Cunningham Auto in Kansas City), although when we moved we had less than stellar treatment (Mahan VW in Houston and 1st Ave Chrysler/Plymouth in Cedar Rapids, Iowa).  Make sure you have a good Euro garage to take your VW unless you have a dealer with a good reputation.  We took our car for service to European Motors in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and they were great, so was Star Motors in Kansas City!  VW's dealer network is one of the most mercurial things on the planet.  Many VW dealers don't deserve to be selling their cars (Bob Mickey's 1st Ave Chrylser/Plymouth is one of them, old guard, high pressure sales).

The Jetta is a great car overall.  It holds its value, fun to drive, and relatively easy on the pocketbook.  Beware for quirks, but overall I'd say our Jetta experience was very satisfactory.<br><br>
