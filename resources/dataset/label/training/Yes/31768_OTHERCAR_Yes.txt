            The BMW 323i is a great car. The exterior is clean and sharp, uncluttered. The door handles are ergonomically designed and do not detract from the clean lines of the 323i. The trunk space is good, not great, and has hydraulic lift so nothing in the trunk can be damaged upon closing the trunk. The interior is simple, intuitive control positioning, and comfortable, at least in the front seat. The rear seats are a bit tight but not too cramped. I highly recommend the wood trim option. I was not excited about wood trim until I saw the alternative which looks cheap. The engine smooth, responds quickly, and my gas mileage runs about 25mpg per tank with about 70% being in town driving and the rest interstate travel. Handling is superb and it is a fun car to drive. However, it does not handle well in snow or ice. Overall, I love my 323i and look forward to driving it on long stretches of winding road. <br><br>
