            After exhaustive research for an SUV that was below $30k, I came down to the Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and the 4 Runner SR5.  Cost wise and fuel efficiency wise the 4 Runner and the Jeep Grand Cherokee are quite similar.  The 4 Runner will probably cost more due to all the various options one must buy in order to complete the SUV (e.g. roof rack, running boards, cd player etc.).  I went with this car b/c it was a foreign vehicle with a reliable name behind it.  If you want more comfort in the seating, options like a cd player, leather seats, remote radio player on the steering wheel, more hip room, etc. included with the vehicle, I would go with the Cherokee.  But, if you are willing to spend a little more on the option packages, the 4 runner does have all the amenities you want with a more reliable name behind it.  I really enjoy my 4 runner, though I would have liked if they made the interior wider to provide more hip room.  The car itself is pretty high up so it is necessary that one get running boards.  There are no power seats and the driver's side has no vanity mirror.  Overall I would rate the 4 runner 7 out of 10.  I would also check out the new Nissan X-terra which costs substantially less and was voted Motor Trend SUV of the year.  <br><br>
