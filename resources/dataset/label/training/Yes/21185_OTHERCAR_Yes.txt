            I bought this car to blend in with society--my Toyota pickup was something of a reliable eyesore and I no longer needed its reliable cargo carrying ability.
I bought this car on my credit card, receiving a discount of about a grand from the dealer's window sticker price.  This was my first car purchase from a dealer and I was very pleased. The car was prepped well and has a warranty, though not a long warranty.
I am very pleasantly surprised by the quiet ride, easy, confidence-inspiring handling, and the smooth, strong brakes. The acceleration is adequate, though there is admittedly no &quot;emergency&quot; acceleration of any kind. The car is quiet, the seats are pleasantly firm and comfortable. Heating is quiet and effective. AM/FM radio is adequate.
Mostly, this car is cute and gets great gas mileage. Mine has the one liter, triple. First tank netted 42mpg at an average of 65mph with a little Oakland hills driving mixed in.  The car is happier at 65mph than 70mph.
Bad points on mine: The little backseat seatback release knobs are broken off. The tan dash is discolored. The hubcaps are also discolored, apart from the obvious curb scratches.
The engine compartment is beautiful. If Suzuki indeed designed this engine, it should live a happy life. I've had several Suzuki motorcycles and though fit and finish is not their forte, reliable engines definitely are. The engines take abuse and soldier on and on.
One other disappointment is the turning radius. The wheels don't crank as sharp as my Toyota's so the short wheelbase/length isn't the advantage that you'd expect when doing u-turns. But I guess it was a design thing.
Overall, extremely happy with mine.<br><br>
