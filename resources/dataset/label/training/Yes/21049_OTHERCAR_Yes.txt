            Eastman Kodak�s entr�e into the fashion camera category is the new <b>Kodak EasyShare LS420</B>. Though not Kodak�s first pocketable camera, the LS420 does stake out some interesting territory in the high-end market. The $299 2.1 megapixel camera is only 4.3 inches wide, 1.1 inches deep and 1.8 inches high. It weighs 5.64 ounces with battery and 
card.

  Packed into this little marvel are a 3x digital zoom, tripod socket and 1.6 LCD. It has a 38mm focal length, and has a focusing range of 2.6 feet to infinity. The camera has an optical viewfinder, but because the camera is so small, most users will use the LCD.

  Like the Sony P series it resembles, the Kodak EasyShare LS420 can sometimes produce shaky images. This is due to the small size and broadly horizontal design. You really have to make sure you�re holding it steady, especially at long zoom ranges.

  Speaking of zoom, the LS420 has a 3X digital zoom, which is controlled by a little joystick in the back. This joystick is a new approach for Kodak, and differs in use from the usual button modes that other cameras have. In �camera mode�, if you move the joystick to the right, this launches the digital zoom. This isn�t exactly intuitive, especially since it�s not marked anywhere on the camera that this is what the joystick can do. Also, the joystick is a little difficult to use when holding the camera to your eye.

  The camera has 8 Mb of internal memory, and a Multi-Media Card slot. There�s no bundled memory, which I think is a glaring oversight. For one thing, the Print button can�t create an order for images stored in internal memory.

  Picture quality is pretty good for a 2.1-megapixel camera in this price range. Choices of resolution are �Best� quality � 1,752 �by-1168 pixels and �Good� quality � 876-by-584 pixels. As expected in point-and-shoot digicams these days, there�s a bit of lag between pressing the button and the actual picture being taken. 

  Kodak is relatively new at offering a video mode in its cameras, but this model offers choices of either 320-by-240 pixel or 160-by-120 pixel movie clips. Both capture at 19.1 frames per second. These are fairly nice clips to view on your PDA � the  320-by-240 pixel movies look smashing on my Sony Clie � but by no means would you mistake the LS420 for a video camera.

  Also in this bundle is the bundled accessory dock. The dock is bigger than the camera, at 5.4 inches wide, 2.5 inches deep and 1.3 inches high. Unlike other EasyShare docks � which normally cost about $70 extra above and beyond the camera � the LS420 dock won�t accept other Kodak EasyShare cameras. With the old dock, you could swap out an insert specific for your camera, so when you bought a new camera, you could use the same dock. Given the radical size differential from this camera versus the other brick-like EasyShares, it�s understandable.

  When hooked up to the dock, the LS 420 is supposed to automatically download the camera�s pictures after pressing the transfer button. Kodak�s Picture Software is supposed to be easy to use, but I�ve always found it to be cumbersome and under-featured. Really, it�s easier to just navigate the camera like it�s another disk drive, and pull the images off that way.

  In addition to linking the camera to the computer for image downloading, the dock also recharges the battery. The camera�s battery is a unique rechargeable battery, which means, when it runs out, you can't just pop in handy AA batteries in a pinch.

  The camera comes with a zip-case that looks like an eyeglass case. Very stylish, but not too useful, since there�s no place for any accessory cards.

  Overall, the LS 420 is a solid little camera. It�s got a nice design, especially if you like the trend toward smaller cameras.
