            This is my favorite car in the world! I mean this SUV has absolutely everything! It has 8 cup-holders, about 10 speakers, and for those people who don't like SUV's because of the difficulty to get aboard, due to it's height, the Navigator even has a kneeling option. This is helpful when you're shopping and you have to put all that heavy stuff into the car. It also has adjustable pedals that you can move closer to the seat if you're &quot;vertically impaired&quot;. This comes in a variety of attractive colors, and it is surprisingly powerful with 300hp.(That come close to the Lamborghini Diablo!) The Lincoln is the second roomiest SUV's in the world.(Yukon XL is first.) Driving he Navigator is like driving a cloud with steering wheels! It corners and accelerates like a car. Who should buy this vehicle?...Well, if you really need to know, EVERYONE!
