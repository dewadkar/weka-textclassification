            We recently bought a 1998 Pontiac Bonneville.  We have thoroughly enjoyed our experience so far.

The Bonneville has something for everyone.  My husband loves it because it has a relatively large motor in it.  It goes fast and handles very well.  I love it because it seriously seems to hug me every time I get into it.  My indoor furniture isn't even as comfortable as the car!  I also like it because it is big and I feel very safe in it. The kids like it because it has a huge back seat.  

There are also the little things:  It has a heater/air conditioning vent that sits on the back of the console which sends climate control right back to the back seat.  That is such a great idea!  It has little areas in the glove box to put air fresheners so that they aren't showing, but when you run the heat, it goes right through the air fresheners making the car smell good.  It has sunglasses holder, a pocket on the visor for registration and insurance (so you don't have to dig for them), and it has a little cubby hole that we use for mints and gum (for us non smokers, I am sure that it is a perfect place for cigarettes and lighters for those who haven't quit smoking yet).  The trunk is absolutely huge, you could practically live in it.  There is a drink holder in the back seat.  When you pull it down, you also have access to the trunk.  You can adjust the driver's seat any way that you can possibly imagine.  

What I don't like is the airbags.  I am sure that they are fine, but I always have this fear that they are going to go off for no reason.  We have passenger side as well as driver's side.  The only other thing that I would change about our car is that it has bench seats in front making the passenger max 5.  I would prefer to be able to take 6 people if I needed to.

Aside from the little things, here's the big stuff:  It drives like a dream.  The gas mileage is fair, I think about 25 mpg.  We bought this car because we know that it will last forever if we take good care of it.  We also heard that resale value is very high for these vehicles.  <br><br>
