<TEXT>
            After owning economy cars most of my life, in 1991 I decided to buy something that would last more than the 4 or 5 troubled years of my previous vehicles. The consumer magazines did not seem to favor the S10, but I had seen so many on the road, I wondered 'how bad could they be?'. The salesman recommended I avoid the 4 cylinder model, so I got the 4.3 liter, 6 cylinder S10. I fell in love with the truck when I first saw it and I still love it 9 years later. I have had very few major repair problems and it passes PA's strict emission inspections every year. 
9 years later the truck still runs smooth and steady. It doesn't have quite the 'pep' it used to, but it is more than enough. I'm not in the market for a new vehicle, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy another S10.<br><br>
