            I was first attracted to the Alero by its looks. Finally, a small sedan that was not boring to look at. Just getting into a sedan was a big step for me, since my previous cars had been Monte Carlos, a Grand Prix Coupe and a Firebird. However, the birth of our first baby meant that coupes were no longer practical,and also that saving money was important. Luckily, the Alero meets all my needs without breaking my budget. 
First, the Alero is surprisingly comfortable. I never have to adjust the seats, and feel there is plenty of &quot;elbow room&quot;. The baby seat fits fine in the back seat, along with other assorted paraphernalia. The trunk is a great size. I can fit the baby stroller and a load of groceries in there at the same time. 
Second, the V6 engine is peppy and responsive. After driving larger vehicles, I thought that I would be disappointed in the Alero's performance. But that is not the case at all. I can zip around in traffic, easily accelerate onto the highway with confidence. What can I say, this car is fun to drive!
Finally, the value. I have all the features I look for in a vehicle - CD player, cruise control, leather seats (nice!), automatic headlights and keyless remote. All this at a pretty affordable price - $21,000. And at the time I bought the vehicle, there were rebates and incentives which brought the price down to around $19,000. I don't think this combination of features, price, driveability and stylishness can be beat. I highly recommend the Alero.<br><br>
