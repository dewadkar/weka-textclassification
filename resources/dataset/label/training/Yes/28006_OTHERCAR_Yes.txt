            After one year of ownership I strongly recommend this product to anyone interested in a compact car.  I purchased the SE1 Sedan for $17,300 from Carsdirect.com.  It came with aluminum wheels, four-speed automatic transmission, power windows/locks, cassette deck, A/C, power seat (up and down only) and cruise control.  The 150 horsepower, four cylinder engine, is more than adequate, unless your goal is to drag race.  I have been averaging 25 mpg and it only requires 87 octane fuel.  The car is built like a rock, no rattles or squeaks and it handles very well.  I have almost 15,000 miles on it and not a single thing has gone wrong.  I've had no problem putting in two baby seats in the back seat.

Visibility is excellent, except in the rear where the optional &quot;tail&quot; makes it difficult to see small children behind the car.  I recommend going very slow when reversing in parking lots.  If rear visibility is a serious concern I recommend NOT getting the &quot;tail&quot;.

The automatic oil-change feature is great.  It monitors your driving habits and recommends when to change your oil.  The only annoying part is that you have to remove the fuse panel (very easy) to reset the light once the oil has been changed.  It would have been nice if they put the button in an easier to reach location (like the trunk release - out of the way, but accessible in the drivers door).

I routinely drive in a 'city' environment and have also taken it on extended three hour road trips.  Except for some wind noise, where I've actually checked to see if the windows were all the way up, the car is pleasant and easy to drive.  The variable effort steering is excellent and really gives the driver a good feel for the road.

Because of the aero-dynamic design of the front end I recommend you buy a bra for the car, this will reduce the chipping of paint from cars and trucks in front of you kicking up gravel and stones.

The interior is very well laid out, everything is logically designed and the cassette stereo is high enough so that the shifter does not get in the way when trying to change tapes/stations.  The cassette player automatically ejects bad tapes and will automatically eject the &quot;fake&quot; cassette used by portable CD players.  To get around this problem you turn off the radio and hold the &quot;Tape/Eject&quot; button until the tape light comes on.  Then insert the &quot;fake&quot; tape and turn on the radio.

To conclude - this is a very well made car, great ride, well designed interior and a bargain for around $17,000.<br><br>
