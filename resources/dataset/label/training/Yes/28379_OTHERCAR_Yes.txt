            I had gotten the 1991 Prelude Si as my first car, when I was 17 years old, and passed my road test.  4 and 1/2 years, and 70k miles later, the car is still running decently well, with no mechanical problems whatsoever.  
When I first got the car, I particularly loved the styling, as this generation Prelude was a fairly rare sight in my area, as I felt different not driving the Civics and Maximas that almost every other person in the area drove.  The car handled rather well, as I wasn't scared to take a curve on the highway as I did on my mom's old Volvo station wagon.  My car was an A/T, so I couldn't really comment on the cars actual performance, since A/T's tend to run slower than a stick, but from my driving experience it was still satisfactory.  I've taken 400 mile road trips in my trusty Prelude without a hitch.  And I can't remember taking my car in for any actual repairs at all, (minus the auto body shop in which the car itself isn't to blame), and scheduled maintenance.
I feel that this was a car (...4 years ago) that was too good to be deemed a first car that would be abused and not taken care of by a typical 17 year old rookie driver.  But luckily in my case, the car withstood much of the abuse I gave it, and to this day it still runs great (albeit a bit slower... car has 160K miles on it now.)  But now, in 2000, this generation of Prelude could be had for cheap, so it would indeed make a great first car for many others.  Also, if you plan on transporting 4 or more people regularly, this is definitely not the car to get.  Your rear seated passengers will complain during even the shortest of trips, due to the fact that their knees will cramp up if they sit in the car for longer than 15 minutes!
All in all, this is a great car that has caused me no reliability problems and withstood much rookie driver abuse and still runs great to this day.<br><br>
