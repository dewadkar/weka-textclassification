            There comes a time when must stop and admire it. IT IS THE CAR - the NSX . . . . OF COURSE. With its low to the ground body and dazzling paint (my favorite spa yellow pearl) this car cannot be overlooked. The NSX comes with a 3.2 liter engine producing 290 horsepower. The uncomparable looks of the car are even more enhanced by the 17&quot; rims in back and the 16&quot; rims in the front. The long body of the car and the structural design aids the great handling in this car. Of course you could buy a Porsche at this price but nothing compares to the handling and looks of the car. What is the point of having a car that goes fast only in a straight line? This is why the NSX was created, for those out there who want a car that will take them tightly around corners and bends without the car fussing. The wishbone suspension on the car makes it light yet durable letting you take the car at speeds you thought to be unconceivable around corners. Sitting in the car and hearing the engine idle lets you know it is packing a lot of power. Just nail the gas and go through all six gears and go to a top speed of 150+ mph. This is a car for racing on tracks and for driving around your neighborhood while going around the windy turns at high speeds. I cannot find any drawbacks to this car except for the price. But what is money when you have pure power, handling, and looks?? <br><br>
