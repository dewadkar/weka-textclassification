            The 2000 Ford Focus SE was a wise choice for me.  Not only does the car have style, it has a added extras you would find in a luxury car and the gas mileage is terrific (28 mpg).  The engine can not be heard while driving, in fact is it so quite sometimes you wonder if you turned the car on!  

My added extras included cruise control, driver and passenger air bags, 2.0L split port induction engine, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with CD player, spoiler, tachometer, fog lamps, and tilt steering just to name the best.  

When driving this vehicle, you will experience a smooth ride and you can drive it with pride.  Not only is it a good looking car, it is economical.

If savings and luxury are your utmost concern, your best bet is to test drive and then purchase a Ford Focus.  You will not be sorry!  It's great!<br><br>
