            I never thought I would buy a Ford Taurus, but now that I have it, I love it.  Not only is this car one of the top sellers in it's series, it is a car that is well worth the money.  I have a 1997 Ford Taurus and I can honestly say we have not had anything seriously go wrong with it.  The only minor problem that we have had, is in 1998, the driver's side window would not come back up.  My windows are electric and something at shorted out.  That's it!

The door has the beams in the side to prevent a serious injury die to impact.  Another classic feature, is the secret to starting the vehicle.  Once you have put the key in the vehicle, and turn it to start it.....it would seem as though you have a dead battery.  To get the car to start, you must pull the turn signals handle toward you.  Upon doing so the car will start.  You have to do this anytime the vehicle has been turned off.  I like this because I know that my son would never be able to start the vehicle.  Heck, when I first bought the car, I didn't know that....so I got all ticked off and thought I had bought a lemon.  Did I ever feel dumb when he explained it to me.

The car is roomy, yet sporty.  It can get up and go.....and best of all it looks good.  Seats are nice and big, and you don't feel cramped during a long trip.  The truck is huge, and the back seats fold down for even more room if you need to haul something big.

I would highly recommend this car.....and I am thinking of buying a new one.   They look sweet.....and they are a great car.
