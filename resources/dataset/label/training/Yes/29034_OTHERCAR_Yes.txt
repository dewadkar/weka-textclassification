            Just 2 weeks ago I purchased a 2001 Honda CRV.  The one that I purchased is the CRV EX 4 wheel drive model.  It is the perfect SUV for any age group.  I am a Honda lover; therefore, the CRV was my choice in a SUV line.  I have driven several SUV's and found that the Honda was the best one suited for me.  The Honda CRV drives just like a car.  It corners easy and rides very smoothly.  All of the options are right at your fingertip.  Most options anyone would want are considered a standard option.  The seats are very comfortable and you sit up high enough to really see what is going on around you.

The cargo space is quite large and with the ability to fold down the rear seats, either both or single, you have plenty of space to haul most anything.  My gas mileage is averaging about 22 mpg around town.  I have not had it on a trip yet to determine the highway mileage.  

I think that the Honda CRV is a vehicle that any age group can drive.  For the price and comfort, anyone looking for a SUV should go test drive a Honda CRV.  I think they will be very impressed.<br><br>
