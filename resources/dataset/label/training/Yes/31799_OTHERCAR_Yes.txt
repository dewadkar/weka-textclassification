            This is my first car.  I bought a car because my company was planning to move.  I needed a reliable, safe, affordable car that can take the 35-mile daily commute.

I bought a  2000 Honda Civic EX sedan with automatic transmission because it fit the bill perfectly.  When I first started car-shopping, I had my heart set on a 2000 Jetta.  After further research, the Civic was by far the wiser choice.  I rather get a loaded up, top of the line Civic than a base model Jetta.  

I love almost practically everything about the car:  power everything; sunroof (my fave feature); CD and stereo; strong A/C (gets cool really fast in the muggy weather of Boston); ABS brakes; zippiness (127 hp engine); maneuverability; nice interior; cup-holders that will accommodate super-sized drinks; quiet, solid ride (compare to other cars of its class); comfy seats and footrest; lots of compartments (on the doors, in the armrest, glovebox, and truck).

Since my company has yet to move (move date pushed out, again), all I've been doing is city driving.  My main gripe about the car is that it is not as fuel-efficient as it is reputed to be.  I was told by practically everyone that I'd get 28/35 city/highway gas mileage.  I've only filled up twice (I bought it less than a month ago), but I found that I am only getting about 23 miles to the gallon.  I don't know why it's not fuel-efficient...perhaps it's because I am driving through the Boston traffic everyday.

That's my only gripe about the car.  Otherwise, I adore my little cute car.  Driving is such a nice departure from public transportation.<br><br>
