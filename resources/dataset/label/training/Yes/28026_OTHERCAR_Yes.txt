            My husband and I bought a Plymouth Neon in 1998.  We have thorougly enjoyed driving it.  It is a wonderful automobile in many ways. 

We bought it mainly because it was in our price range, looked good and drove great.  We bought a 2 door highline and I cannot rave enough on this car! It handles great and we get really good gas mileage.  My husband drives about 300 miles a week and it costs less than 80$ a month for gas.  Plus we have never had a single problem with the car.  We have never had to take it to the shop for anything, other than routine oil changes.  The interior is roomy and the seats are very comfy.  The back seat is somewhat small, but perfect size for kids or smaller adults.  

This car is a great car for first time buyers or people on a limited income.  It is a nice car, comfortable and sporty.  PLUS it is inexpensive, even with the extras.    We recently went back to the dealer and bought a second neon, a 4 door and we love it too!  

I recommend Neon's to anyone who wants a great car but doesn't want to break the bank.  <br><br>
