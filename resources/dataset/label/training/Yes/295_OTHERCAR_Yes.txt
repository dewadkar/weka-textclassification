            The Toyota MR2 is the only afforably-priced mid-engine car available in the U.S. The next least expensive mid-engine car, the Porsche Boxster, starts at twice the price. This alone makes the MR2 worth a look for anyone shopping for a roadster. The only other roadster in this price range is the Mazda Miata. Which is best?

<b>Background</b>

Every time Toyota redesigns the MR2 it emerges as a completely different car. The only constant is the mid-engine layout. The first MR2 was very compact and prized for its agility. Its origami styling was a bit hard on the eyes (my eyes at least), but it was undeniably great fun to drive. These were favorites among the SCCA weekend racer set. The second MR2 was a product of the Japanese bubble, conceived when Japan was riding high and its auto companies were pouring content into cars. It was a larger, much more refined car, Toyota�s rendition of a pocket Ferrari. With the 15� wheels that came a few years in, it was a much better looking car than the first, but lacked its character. The driving experience similarly both benefited and suffered. The optional power steering ($600), not available on the first car, made the car easier to drive, but was unacceptably numb. All of this said, I still wouldn�t mind owning a 1993-95 MR2 turbo. 

The first two generations approximated open air motoring with generously sized T-Tops. The third is the real thing, a true top-down roadster. Aside from going the roadster route, the third MR2 marks a return to the tidy proportions of the first car. Is the fun spirit back as well?

<b>Styling and Accommodations</b>

The MR2 looks like a Japanese Boxster, which I suppose is what it is. By �Japanese� I mean less round, edgier, and busier. The result lacks the fluid prettiness of the previous MR2. Perhaps Toyota went this way to recall the character of the first MR2? At any rate, it does, and I can see how this might be preferable to a prettier but less distinctive design.

The interior styling I find less defensible. Like that in the Lexus IS 300, the MR2�s interior is full of flat surfaces and pointlessly busy details. Very mid-1980s. I suspect the same designers were involved.

The driver�s seat is mounted low within a much taller body than that of the Miata. I vastly prefer the driving position of the latter. Sadly, most roadsters have the same �in a deep hole� driving position as the MR2. I�d like to be able to see out better, at least to the sides. The view forward is acceptable. 

With the top up the interior borders on claustrophobic, even worse than the generally bad small roadster norm. The side windows are very small. Putting the top up and down requires getting out of the car, something you don�t have to do in a Miata or Z3. At least it stows in an innovative manner, with the hard central section stowing outside surface up. Generally convertible tops stow with the inside surface up. The MR2�s unique design allows it to get by without a fussy boot. The top also includes a glass rear window with defroster, better for both longevity and all-weather visibility.

The seat is moderately bolstered (in such a tight interior you�re going nowhere anyway) and reasonably supportive. Leather is now an option, but my car had the grippier, high quality cloth. I had enough room, more than in the Miata, but I�m 5�9�. Larger people might be cramped. The door-mounted armrest is hard to the point of being uncomfortable if used for an extended period of time. I recognize that Toyota has to keep costs down to price the car where it is, but a few dollars here would be much appreciated.

Cargo space is almost nonexistent. Plan on carrying no more than three small soft bags unless you use the passenger seat to carry a suitcase. The passenger seat airbag can be turned off, which will be appreciated by those who would like to put a child there.

<b>On the Road</b>

The MR2 is available only with a 138 horsepower DOHC 1.8 liter four. For some reason, Toyota does not offer its 180 horsepower version of the same engine in this car, inexplicably saving it for the Matrix. Also, unlike with both past MR2 generations, an uplevel model with a turbocharged or supercharged engine is not offered. Still, because the MR2 only weighs 2200 lbs., the lower output 1.8 provides good punch at all RPM. Though some will find it lacking in power (and Toyota should offere a more powerful engine for them), I felt the amount of power was in line with the light, nimble character of the car. The sounds it makes are typical of a fairly smooth four, neither inspiring nor disturbing. 

The manual transmission, my preference, helps get the most out of the engine. It has short throws, low effort, and a great "snick-snick" mildly notchy feel. The clutch was also low in effort. I had no trouble finding whatever gear I wanted in an instant. Overall, the shifter provided a pleasingly direct connection to the engine. My only wish would be for a sixth gear, to cut RPM and the attendant engine noise at highway speeds. 

The shift knob in the car I drove rotated in my hand, but at least it did not pop off (as in some BMWs I have driven). The salesman claimed this was because the car had been driven hard, but it had only 100 miles on the odometer.

Like the shifter, the steering on the new MR2 provides a refreshingly direct connection to what is going on. Though not as �alive� as the steering on a Miata or BMW Z3, it represents a huge improvement over the numb power steering of the second generation MR2. Assist is proportional to vehicle speed, not engine speed, which in my experience is the better way to go as effort doesn't change every time you shift to a different gear. The steering is quick but short of being darty. The car goes precisely where it is pointed, with a feel akin to the world�s most refined go-kart (the Honda S2000 may more deserve this title, but I haven�t driven it). The mid-engine configuration renders the car especially agile, as mass is concentrated near the center of rotation, reducing inertia. The light weight translates to good grip even without wide tires.

The MR2�s ride is hardly luxurious, though compared to the Miata it is quite composed. Seven inches more wheelbase certainly helps here. Also, the lighter weight of the car means that the suspension doesn�t have to be made extremely firm to control body motions. High RPM aside, the MR2 is a more pleasant highway cruiser than the Miata. The tall bodysides make for less turbulence and noise with the top down.

<b>Pricing</b>

At $24,000 ($600 more for leather), the MR2 is very inexpensive for a mid-engined roadster. Toyota imports a limited number, and for the first few years many Toyota dealers were charging as much as $30,000 for the base car. My sense is that the initial hysteria has calmed down enough that most simply charge sticker now.

The Miata runs about $3,000 less expensive after dealer discounts. Other alternatives such as the Honda S2000 and BMW Z3 run at least $8,000-12,000 more.

<b>Last Words</b>

I greatly enjoyed driving the MR2. But then I went and drove a Miata immediately afterwards, and had even more fun. The MR2 is the better riding, more refined car. But the Miata is more open, and simply feels more �alive.� The MR2 does precisely what you want it to, but the Miata with its extremely direct controls and more aurally expressive engine feels more an extension of the driver. For these reasons, I personally prefer the Miata, at least as a weekend-only car. That it costs less is an additional bonus.

Which makes a better everyday car is debatable. The MR2 is quieter and more composed, and thus generally less tiring to drive long distances, while the Miata has considerably more (though still not much) cargo space. In my mind, neither is a great choice for commuting.
