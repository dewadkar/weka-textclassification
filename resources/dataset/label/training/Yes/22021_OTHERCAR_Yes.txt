            I have the almost the same Grand Prix as casualsuede....and I cannot believe his review!!!  He could have been writing about MY car!!!  My struts are shot, my brakes are ready for their 3rd replacement, my steering column smokes too!!!!  My drivers seat is shot, too!  Then again, this is a seven year old car with 93,000 miles on it... The only difference between my car and his that I can tell is I have is no moon roof and a 3.1 engine instead.

 On the other hand, it has been an extremely reliable car, and has been in 2 severe accidents, (AFTER the above symptoms started) totaling out the other 2 cars, and it doesn't even shimmy on the highway.  It just has front end bumper damage, and some front fender damage, too.  One wreck was nearly head on and my headlights still worked! The other car was totaled, with the entire front end caved in to the windshield. I drove mine away.  Not even a radiator leak! This is a VERY durable car, starts easily a sub zero temps, and has been very reliable.  Inside design features are not that well made, but I look for reliability instead of fancy gadgets.  The only thing I HATE is .... no glove box trunk opener!

Car handles great in all weather, it's low profile hugs the road.  Drives nicely. Red lights on the dash take some getting used to, and the all across the front headlights are unusual, but nice if one goes out! Only one serious downside --- there are very annoying blind spots due to poor design, on either side of the windshield between the windshield and the front door window.  They drive me nuts. Very aggravating, makes it hard to see traffic from side streets as you approach an intersection.

I bought this car out of urgency, my other car was broke down, I needed a car, and it was there, and I was glad to get it! I would definitely get it again!

Repair visits included a serpentine belt, water pump (which caused the belt to break), new brakes, and a window that came off the track.  All minor problems, to be expected with a car of that age.<br><br>
