            2002 Ford Excursion Limited 4X4 7.3L PowerStroke Diesel

The vehicle I looked at was black with monochromatic trim and looked very nice.  However, this is a huge vehicle that seems rather commercial.  
Starting in the front, this vehicle looks just like a Ford F250 pickup.  I popped the hood to check out the engine and found that I had to stand on the bumpers or front tires to get a good look.  Then I had another problem, how to close the hood once opened.  Ford needs a power closer on that hood.  Not sure how high it was, but had to stand on the front tires and push it down. 
I guess the diesel engine gave it the impression of a truly commercial vehicle.  It starts and whooshes like a Greyhound, minus the smoke.
Once climbing in, the interior is very nice.  Dual climate controls, DVD LCD screen for rear passengers, dual heat and air, leather, power everything, etc.  Reminded me of the Lincoln Navigator.  The back seating area was very easy to get into once you got up your momentum from the ground.  The dutch door setup for the rear doors is very good and allows easy access when a trailer is attached.
On the road the diesel is only noisy when pushing the accelerator, once you even off and are up to speed, it is very quite.  I never heard the turbo scream, only the chug of the diesel.  The powerband of the engine and transmission is odd, in that once you depress the accelerator, it is a few seconds before you are pressed back into your seat with a firm gush of power as the engine RPM's increase.
To justify this vehicle, I would need three kids, at 80k+ salary, and a large camper to pull.  I have the first, ha.
