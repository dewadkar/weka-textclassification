            This 1992 Ford Taurus has been a great service for me. It's really been a good car and stood the test of time(it sounds like I'm talking about a monumental building or great person or something). Seriously though, this car is one that has done quite well me, especially considering it's about 56 in car years now(1 &quot;human year&quot; equals 7 car years). My Ford Taurus is blue and has been &quot;true blue&quot; to me(I love bad puns). I love how it has lasted well and has very few trips to shop for any problems(probably 6 or 7 times in the 8 years I've had it). It rides quite well. It's pretty comfy especially for errands and even longer trips on vacations and things. It's a good family car as my aunt has used it several times with her 2 daughters. It's a little crowded for 5 or more people but it's a good family sedan especially for the 3 and 4 person family.

It's a good car, has served me well, and I think you'd enjoy it and wouldn't be sorry about buying one if you did. Enjoy!
They don't have Firestone tires on them either!<br><br>
