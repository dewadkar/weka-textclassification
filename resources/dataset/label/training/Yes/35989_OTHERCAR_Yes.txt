                <b>A</b>s the 1990s started, the world was amazed to see that Subaru had made such a determined effort to go to the top of the coupe market with the shocking four wheel drive, flat six engined Subaru SVX. While the SVX was not a long running production vehicle, it did boast some amazing attributes during its production run.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

   <b>T</b>he sporty Subaru SVX is very refined, especially since we are talking about a car made by Subaru in 1992. My experience with most Subaru's of this time period have either been negative, or just boring. The flat six engine in the SVX is both smooth and quiet, yet revs freely. Even though it is hampered by the SVX's hefty curb weight, the SVX is no slow poke; it scoots from the light with good prowess. Its traction and handling deserve way more than the 230 horsepower available, however. Even though this car only boasts 230 HP, it still has acceleration that rivals many other cars in its class i.e., the naturally aspirated 1992 300ZX. There's superb grip from the 225/50 ZR 16s, so the rear wheels never break loose, and the front wheels only do so under extreme horse play. Quick steering also enables the driver to sail through bends with no problem.

   <b>A little info about this amazing little engine:</b> 

Subaru's all-new (for 1992) alloy 3.3 liter flat six engine has a large bore, short stroke and four overhead camshafts. Unusually the exhaust cams are driven by a single belt, while the intake cams are gear driven direct from the exhaust cams. They open four valves per cylinder and although there is no variable valve timing, a unique system is used to vary the intake tract length, helping the Boxer motor produce 228 lb-ft of torque at 4,400 RPM. Twin injector rails are fitted and a knock sensor prevents detonation. The 3.3 is coupled with a 4-speed automatic.

     <i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

The Subaru's <b>interior</b> is, to say the least, very original. Totally unlike most Subaru vehicles of this time period, the interior of SVX is surprisingly plush. The leather seating surfaces feel a bit cheap, however I'm not complaining; Subaru could have done much worse here. The SVX also comes with a novel wood-trimmed dash fascia (no overdose of tree meat here). What makes this Subaru's interior so original is all the outward vision. This car has windows everywhere! There is also your proverbial "boat load"  of standard amenities with the SVX. Standard amenities include a power sunroof, power everything, power seats,  etc.! There is plenty of room up front (slightly cramped in the rear) and ergonomics are simple. Also, check out the engine bay, this Boxer engine is a real beauty.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

     The <b>exterior</b> is what makes this Subaru so unique, looking like no other car on the road. Driving one on any road at any place and time turns almost everyone's head. People just don't know what the heck it is. Some ask if it's a concept car (even today), some ask if it's a new Mitsubishi Eclipse, or even a Ferrari; which makes more sense because this design is all Italian. Ninety nine percent of the people on the road will have no idea what you are driving; kinda cool, right? The shape was commissioned  from Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign. In other words, This car is very stylish! It also is very aerodynamic. The low drag coefficient is just 0.29 which helps the SVX be both fast and quiet during high speed cruising.

<i>Conclusion/Pricing:</i>

   Today the Subaru SVX remains  a total enigma and thus prices are pretty high, a 1992 SVX can  set you back from $9,000, all the way to $20,000. Brand new, these cars went for around $25,000-27,000 in the USA, and around $35,000 in Europe. 

    These cars have been very reliable since their introduction in Japan for the 1991 model year. Today they have given their owners in the USA and worldwide years of reliable service and fun.
