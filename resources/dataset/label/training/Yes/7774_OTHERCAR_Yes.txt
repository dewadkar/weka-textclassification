            At exactly one year, and 10,000 miles I have to say that BMW has delivered what it promised. My Black 325Ci with Sport/Premium Pkgs really lives up to the BMW name.
Although I feel as though the 184hp engine is a little jr, it does make up for it somewhat in "Sport Mode", staving off upshifts which gives it a little extra performance at lower speeds during city driving.
The great looking 17" wheels, which came with the Sport Package drive me nuts...they extend further out than the low profile tires, and even with the assistance of the auto-tilt-down passenger mirror, I've managed to gouge the hell out of both front and rear rims by getting too close to the curb. (who wouldn't want their new beemer hugging the curb to keep it away from traffic when parked!?)
Highway driving is bliss, while the 325Ci is considered a "small" car, it manages to feel like a big luxury car on the highway, yet delivering 31 mpg on a recent trip to Portland from the Bay Area! This coupled with panther-like prowess on small twisting roads leaves me craving nothing on the road.
My next car will definitely be a BMW, most likely a 330Ci but I have to give my 325Ci, on a scale of 1-to-10, a big 9.
