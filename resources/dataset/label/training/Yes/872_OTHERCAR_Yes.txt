            This was our first purchase of a digital camera.  Although we'd been wanting a digital for some time, when our 35mm camera began to die.. we decided to get one to replace that as well.  We found the Olympus C3000 to be one of the highest rated in many consumer reports.. now, we can add ourselves to that list.  It's easy to use, the pictures are extremely sharp and develop into awesome quality prints.  

Although not exclusive of this camera, I love that we can preview the shots, fix any red eye or even whiten teeth... and have them uploaded to somewhere such as www.shutterfly.com and developed without leaving my keyboard!

As this is our first digital, I can't compare all the many features.. I can tell you we couldn't be happier with the ease of use, the speed the images download from the camera to the software, and the quality of the photos.
