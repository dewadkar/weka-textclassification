            There's a reason why the BMW 3-Series is the best-selling vehicle in BMW's entire lineup, and why it has been continually praised by numerous automobile magazines - because it truly is a fantastic all-around sedan.  I recently purchased a 2001 Jet Black 325i sedan with premium package for about $33,000.  I haven't stopped smiling since.

First off, I must praise the mechanics of the smooth 2.5 liter inline-six that powers the 325i.  Although admittedly low on horsepower (184) and torque, the engine always stays quiet, and has a remarkable idle RPM of about 600.  Despite the sub-200 horsepower figure, however, the car still feels more than nimble and confident enough to pass traffic or speed up going up a hill, thanks to the valve-timing and lift system of the BMW engine, known simply as "Double VANOS."

How does the car handle? Brilliantly. The speed-sensitive rack and pinion steering provides plenty of road feel, so that the driver never feels disconnected with the road.  Unlike the steering feel in most Japanese automobiles, the steering in the 325i is very sensitive and instantly responsive; just so much as tap the steering wheel in any direction, and the car predictably changes its course accordingly.

The ride is almost always smooth, and the car maintains its composure over even the bumpiest of roads, thanks to the so-called "z-axle" double wishbone suspension in the rear.  Since I didn't opt to purchase the sport package, which includes a sport-tuned suspension, there is noticeable body roll on the vehicle during sharp turns, but I preferred the smoother ride of the car without the sport setup. The 5-speed automatic transmission, known as "Sportronic," works great and shifts predictably. I enjoy using the "sport" mode of the transmission, where the engine is allowed to rev to higher RPMS before changing gears.  This provides excellent highway passing power.

The interior, although rather bland, is composed of high-quality materials, with soft-touch plastics and a rich wood trim (if you opt for it).  My only complaint here is the lack of options on a base 325i; want lighting for the rear passengers? It'll cost you.  Want a cd player? It'll cost you.  Want leather? It'll cost you.  And the list goes on, with amenities such as an auto-dimming rear-view mirror and alarm system (!) that one would expect to be standard on a luxury sedan placed on the list of options. A word of warning; be careful with the options, or you could end up spending upwards of $38,000.

One thing that IS standard on all BMWs, however, is safety.  Included with every 3-Series are "smart" front and side airbags for the driver and passenger, the Head Protection System (head airbags) for the passenger and driver, DSC (dynamic stability control, which controls oversteer and understeer), DBC (dynamic brake control, which modulates braking pressure in emergency situations), AST (all-season traction control), anti-lock brakes, and a side-impact door anchoring system, which protects the driver and passenger in side-impact collisions.  Also, in the event of an accident, the battery terminal cable is immediately cut to prevent the risk of fire.

Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this vehicle to others.  However, I would strongly suggest to those that are able to pay extra to spring for the 225 horsepower 330i. In all truth, power is the only shortcoming of the 325i.
