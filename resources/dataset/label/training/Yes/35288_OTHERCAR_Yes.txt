            Just look at the picture of this car.
Would you buy it?
I wouldn't.
But when the engine went on my brand new Chevy Cavalier I went back to the dealer to trade in that hunk of a lemon for another car.  I didn't have much money at that point because though the dealer was giving me a little bit of a deal it wasn't that good.  That's when I came across a Chevy Corsica 1996 demo that had only 3500 miles on it.  I think the price sticker was around $13,000.  It was ugly (square, silver/green metallic) nothing special, but beggers can't be choosy and a test drive later and I was signing the papers. 
The test drive was great.  I live in the northern hills of NJ and have plenty of steep upgrades to climb.  This baby made those hills look like sea level.  With a beautiful V6 engine you can beat anyone at a light.

Handling:  Great
Seats:     Very comfortable cloth
Stereo:    4 speakers, for a basic stereo it has great sound.
A/C:       was cold, broke at 66,000
Trunk:     spacious but somehow I always cut my hand on something when I 
           reach toward the back

Problems: 
*paint is already chipping off but then again who cares.  I didn't buy this car for it's looks.
*daytime running lights make it impossible to leave your car on at a drive in movie (but I guess many of you don't have those around you.

Overall:  I still have this car, it's wonderful.  I'm dreading the day I'll have to trade it in because I think I'll get too emotional.  I might not look &quot;cool&quot; in this car but I had plenty of left over money to spend on more important things like a house!
