            I owned a Ford Explorer for five years and really enjoyed it. With two daughters involved in various year-round sports activities, it was time to upgrade to a bigger SUV with more seats. We narrowed our choices down pretty quickly to the Ford Expedition and the Chevy Tahoe. The Tahoe won hands down. The ride was much smoother and it handled better on the open road. The Tahoe's turning radius is the best I've ever experienced with a vehicle this size. My wife and I also liked the comfort of the adjustable seats and especially the fact that they are heated doesn't hurt.

Hauling around half the soccer team is a snap. Getting kids into and out of the third row of seats is quick and easy. One of the real nice practical features in the Tahoe is the 50-50 split third row seating. Each seat comes out with a minimum of effort and the seats are light enough that my wife can easily pull them out or put them back when they are needed.

The engine, a vortec V8, is quiet and efficient (getting about 19 miles to the gallon). Even at freeway speeds going uphill the Tahoe still has enough power to accelerate and get around that slow truck quickly! There are only a couple of minor negatives with the Tahoe. The heater is not very responsive. It is either very Hot, or hardly on at all. The other minor negative point is the leg room for the front passenger. Most of the venting equipment for the air conditioner/heater are located there and slightly in the way.

The Tahoe is a bit pricier than it's competition, but in my opinion it's worth it and then some.<br><br>
