            When I bought my Kodak I had been looking to buy a digital camera for several months.  I had been set on buying the Canon Ixus V2 for a while, but by the time I eventually had the money to buy, the V3 was coming out and V2s were hard to find.  So I looked around a bit more, and I'm glad I did because the Kodak 4330 had just been released here in Australia, and it had all the features of the V2 for $AU200 (that's $US100) less!  

So the next opportunity I got I went out and bought the DX4330.  It was as good as I'd hoped; the quality of the video clips were better than my friend's Sony camera that cost several hundred bucks more, and the images are excellent quality.  
My only complaint with image quality is that when taking video or pictures without the flash in low-light situations they are a little dark, but in most situations it's really good.

Uploading the pics to a PC is simple and the software is easy and intuitive.  Like the others who reviewed this, my girlfriend and I managed to use the camera and the software without going near the manual, it's very self explanatory.

My major gripe with the camera is the battery life.  The proprietary CRV3 battery that comes with the camera lasted me a few days of taking lots of pictures, but when that was dying I bought some rechargeable Ni-Mh AA batteries.  These don't last nearly as long.

This is my first digital camera, but I've spent a fair amount of time using other cameras, especially Sony Mavicas; and I find the Kodak really convenient and simple.  
I've also done a bit of photography the old fashioned way with a 20-year old fully manual SLR film camera and I find that for most purposes, you can get the Kodak to do what you want.  

I haven't actually tried creating prints from this camera, but it's ideal for my main use; which is taking pictures and short video clips for my website.
