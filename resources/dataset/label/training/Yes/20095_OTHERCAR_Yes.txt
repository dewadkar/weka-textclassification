            I bought a 1990 Grand Marquis a little more than a year ago for $625. It was such a good deal because it had some body damage to the front fascia. This appears to be a common problem with the Crown Vics and Grand Marquises of the 1989-91 period. The fascia is fiberglass and is easily damaged in a small collision. I made a functional repair to the headlights and turn signal using parts from a junk Grand Marquis.

Here are my positive points about the Grand Marquis:
I love the old-fashioned square styling. It is easy to see where the front edges of the car are because the hood is flat and the edges flare up slightly. The hood is very long, so this is important. The trunk is huge, and the seats are comfortable. It has automatic headlamps, so you never have to worry about leaving the lights on. The power and acceleration seem fine to me. I have only ever driven old cars, pickup trucks, school buses, and vans, so cannot comment on how the steering and brakes compare to a real modern "performance" car, but they do the job for me. It gets very good gas mileage for a V-8, about 20 mi/gallon.

These are some of the complaints I have about the design of the car:
The valve covers are very difficult to remove, you have to take off the upper intake manifold to do it. One of the heater hoses and PCV valve are also partially covered by the upper intake manifold. The spark plugs are somewhat difficult to reach. The transmission will start to chatter if you have to drive at 35 miles per hour. Below or above that speed, it is OK. There is no oil pressure gauge, ammeter, or voltmeter. The radio is placed down low on the dashboard...it is about impossible to look at the radio to change stations while you are driving.

These are the other problems I have encountered with this car and repaired where possible:

Air conditioning worked for about 8 months after I got it, but will not cool anymore.

Replaced the heater blower motor, it was completely burned out. 

The PCV system needs to be checked regularly (valve and crankcase filter) or crankcase pressure will build up and cause MAJOR oil leakage through all the seals, and oil can shoot up out of the dipstick tube. If you have one of these cars and it is leaking oil, make sure the PCV system is in good shape.

Exhaust pipe broke from catalytic convertor to muffler.

The front power windows tend to quit working.

As long as you perform good maintenance on this car and know some of its idiosyncratic problems, it is very reliable and a pleasure to drive.
