            I just purchased my second Town &amp; Country Mini-van (2000 model).  My first was a 1997, and now both cars I own are Town &amp; Country mini-vans.

I have owned mini-vans from all three of the US manufacturers, and no-one can still compare to the quality and luxury of the Town &amp; Country.  This is interesting since 6 years ago I said I would never buy another Chrysler.

The 2000 model is really nice.  It rides as well as any luxury sedan on the road in my opinion.  I purchased an LXi with option package 29y and heated leather seats.  Trust me if you live in the north spend the money for the heated leather seats, you will never regret it.

Why the LXi instead of the Limited?  It was easy.  My wife wanted Patriot Blue, and that is not available in the Limited.

When we compared the Limited, to the LXi with the options you could get in the LXi, the differences were minimal.  If you get the LXi with option package 29y, heated seats, and load leveling suspension the differences are basically cosmetic.

The Limited has over stuffed leather seats (very nice), the rear seat is nicer with the pull down arm rest, it has chrome trim and wheels, and the luggage rack is painted to match the vehicle.  Hard to justify the extra $2000.  Even for someone like me who always believes in buying all of the extras.  My last three purchases were Jeep Grand Cherokee Limiteds with all of the options, and a Chrysler Town &amp; Country LXi (Before they had the limited).

These are great touring vans.  We have a 6 year old and a 7 year old, and have taken the 1997 on four long trips.  Pull out the center seats, put in a small TV and a VCR, and the kids will be comfortable for hours.  These trips were all 1300 miles plus each way.

Then all the extras: endless cup holders, fabulous stero system, rear pull out seat on wheels (very heavy), keyless entry, security system, heated seats, and pretty much the easiest side doors to open and close out there.

For people telling you to wait for the 2001 because of the on board video system, bunk.  My 2000 came with an after market video system ($1400).  It included, a pull down TV, Sony Play Station, Video Cassette Player, and Two Wireless head sets.This vehicle is a 9.9 out of 10.

If you would have ever told me both of our cars would be mini-vans, I would say you were nuts.  But, after the '97 being perfect, and having a total of two visits to the shop in 3 years, and 50,000 how could I complain.  I am sure the 0.9% 60 month financing didn't hurt either.
