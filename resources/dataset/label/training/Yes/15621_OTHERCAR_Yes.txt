            This camera is the workhorse of the digital camera market.  Our engineering department has purchased and used three different digital cameras from three different manufacturers.  The Sony, by far, is the best. 

Down fall of the first two cameras were their short battery life and limited download speed.

The Sony has one of the longest lasting batteries with the fastest recharge.  It is not uncommon for our camera to take 50 pictures a day.  The Liquid Crystal Display allows you to view your pictures, so you can decide if your picture is good enough or if another one needs to be taken.  The 3.5&quot; floppy is super convenient.  You can store up to thirty pictures on one disk. The pictures are automatically saved in .JPG form.  You can view the picture with an internet browser.  

What makes these model lines even better is the short video you can take that saves the file in .MPEG.  Take a picture of whatever and email it to whomever. 

Although not recommended, these cameras are capable of handling the abuse of nine engineers.  Our second camera, a different brand, broke after a drop from three feet. 

Shortcomings:
Picture takes a few seconds to save the file to the 3.5&quot; floppy.  You have to wait for the camera to process the picture before you can snap another one.  
Cost is high.
I plan to purchase a one for my family when the cost falls below $500.00. <br><br>
