            I cannot say easily express how impressive this little dynamo is.  I ordered online for less than $450 including shipping.  Without so much as reading a manual I put the included lithium battery in, installed the included 16 meg Secure Digital card, turned the wheel to auto and was taking practice photos.  It really is that easy for the novice camera user.  You can grow with this camera;  as you become familiar and adept at using the many auto features you can begin to use manual adjustments and modes to make pictures unaattainable with a point and shoot camera of any size.  The lcd view screen is crystal clear. The shutter delay is very short( all digitals have a shutter delay).  I would reccogmend this camera to the professional who wants to be able to take incredible pictures but doesn't want to or can't lug full SLR gear around.  I wanted to buy a SLR type full size camera but after pondering for quite some time I realized that the perfect camera is the one you can take with you any where, the Minolta F100 is that camera.  No other camera for any dollar ammount has so many features and quality of construction in such a small package, period.  You will be impressed, especially if you have owned digital cameras in the past as I have. ( Well it was an HP 210, a toy for the most part, but have experience with SLR cameras as well as maual developing.)  This camera begs to be carried anywhere.
My only advice is as follows:  Those new to digital cameras need to learn that ALL digital cameras have shutter lag, learn it's timings and when to shoot,  Buy a quality battery charger and a couple sets of 1600-1800 Mah Nimh batteries, a memory card of at leaste 64 MB, and purchase a small case and you are ready for a fun new world.  Take it everywhere and experiment.  Enjoy!
