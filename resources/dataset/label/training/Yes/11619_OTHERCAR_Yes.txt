            Almost a year ago, my husband and I were looking in the newspapers for a good and reliable car. We came across a 1992 Nissan Sentra, red in color.
The car gives us very good gas milage, and runs very well.

When we first bought the car on the way home, the wheels were messed up, and the man who sold it to us did not tell us, but bnesides that, its an awesome car.

My advice is before you buy a car, make sure you check everything on it, and get the dealers phone number so that you can call if you have any problems.

Our Nissan has a sun roof, and if you are looking for a sun roof i would suggest no sun roof. Ours leaks. And in hot weather the sun shines right on you, but a Nissan is a great car guaranteed.<br><br>
