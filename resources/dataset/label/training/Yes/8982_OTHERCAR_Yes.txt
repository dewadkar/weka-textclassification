            WOW, what an awesome car!  Great styling, good looks and power to go with it!  I don't know about you, but that's what I look for in a vehicle.  

I have owned two previous Grand Am's and this one is a BIG improvement.  Most people choose a Grand Am because it�s a good economical car with a lot to offer too. That's why I chose it and it�s delivered.  I have a little over 10,000 miles on my car now and I love it as much as the first test drive.  There's something great about getting a great car for under $20,000.  

I have heard allot of people say they went a little overboard in the styling dept, I disagree but if your a little more conservative give the Oldsmobile Alero a try.  Same car, but more conservative.   

The good people at Pontiac always seem to put together great cars and their product line for 2000 is no different.  Check it out go to www.pontiac.com.<br><br>
