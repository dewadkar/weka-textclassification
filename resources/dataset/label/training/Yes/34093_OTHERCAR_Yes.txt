            This is my first impressions of this camera after playing with it for 1/2 hour and comparing it to several other digicams I'm trying out. I'll provide many comparisons here for you.

This camera was recently on a special at the local officemax store for only $199. That's at least $100 less than most 2 megapixel cams.  And it has 3X optical + 4x digi zoom.  That's pretty good!

It came with a camera case, a/c adapter, cables for RS232 serial and USB, Image software, cable to show pics on the TV.

I've recently bought a few digital cams to try out. I'm trying to decide and returning the ones I don't want. I've never had a digital cam before.  I am a highly techincal person, involved in a technical career.

This one has lots of features though.

I have noticed that this camera (unlike many other digicams I've tried) has many useful buttons on it instead of a "menu to do 100 things" mentality of other cams. So, it does operate a lot like a point and shoot camera which I would think would make it very easy to use for a new digicam user.

The springs in the battery door are so stong that it's hard to close the battery door. But it does have a "lock" on it.

It doesn't have DPOF (Digital print order format) support. DPOF allows selection of pics for printing to DPOF compatible printers.  This doesn't seem like a big loss to me.

One thing I've noticed with this cam is that the pics are dark - but today was a dark day outside.

There is a means to change exposure settings up and down for backlit objects.

It was interesting that this camera has a little speaker and unlike many other digicams that pause for a while to take the picture, this one still pauses but makes a "shutter noise" during the wait which makes it seem like there isn't a delay.  I kinda laughed when I realized that this was an added sound effect. It's kinda funny when you think about it, a digicam making the sound of a SLR 35mm cam.  Nice little trick and a novel idea.

Also, on macro mode (in low light conditions) I experienced low depth of field (i.e. pics of close up objects were only in focus at a very narrow distance, items 1 or 2 inches away from the focus area in either direction were out of focus).

I also didn't notice if there is a means to lock the exposure (many cams have the means to lock the exposure setting by holding the shutter button half way down and then frame the pic before you take it).

Another item I am trying to look into more is that the pictures I took out my back door seem to have a dark looking green in the grass. but, again, it was a dark cloudy day today.

I'm comparing it's features to that of another camera I'm trying out: the Fujifilm Finepix 1300 (a 1.3 megapix cam).  I plan to take pictures in the same lighting conditions and see what they look like). I'll try to report back with more info.

At this point I might return the camera and keep looking.
