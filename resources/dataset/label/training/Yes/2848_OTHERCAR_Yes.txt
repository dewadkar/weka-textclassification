            Nothing seems to compare to this car for the money. I have owned three Preludes (88, 91 &amp; 99) and have loved them all. They are great drivers cars and like to be driven hard. They are not for everyone though. 2001 should be the last year that Honda produces this fine automobile so if you own the new body style be pre-paired to make money on your car if you choose to sell it. There aren't many cars out there that give you two-hundred horses and still produce thirty miles to the gallon! I got my 99 below invoice price so watch for deals out there! Enjoy...<br><br>
