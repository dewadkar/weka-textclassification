            I'll admit that I have not driven many cars as I am only 19, but I have driven my Mountaineer for almost 40,000 miles without a problem.  The car that I got came fully loaded with CD Played, Hi-Fi Stereo system, rear climate control, even a kleenex box hidden in the front seat.  The firemist red metallic with dark grey lower paint treatment is quite possibly the most beautiful dolor on a car that I have seen and even looks different in the summer sun.  
I have also had someone hit me in my Mercury an as we all do I fear the worst in any accident.  However, the car took an approximately 30 MPH hit in the front left wheelbase and all I felt was us being moved sideways.  The durability and stability of the Mountaineer make it a car to be recond with and a very safe/protecting vehicle.
If you are looking for a spacious car that has comfortable seats, plenty of room, and safety for you and your loved ones the Mountaineer is your car.<br><br>
