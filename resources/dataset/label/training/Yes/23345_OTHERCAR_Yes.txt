              In my quest for the ultimate in affordable sports cars, I found myself a few years back buying a 1994 Mazda RX-7. Today, for the money, I do not think you will find a more uncompromising sports car. One in which everything is designed for performance and handling. It is very quick, very smooth, and very responsive, but there are a few things anyone looking to buy one of these cars should know.

  First, check to make sure all recalls have been done. There are a few which need to be completed. Second, make sure that the fuel filter is changed periodically (almost every 30Kmiles), since a partially clogged fuel filter will thin the fuel mixture out, making the engine run hotter and the possibility of damaging the turbo increases. A blown turbo could easily destroy the engine. Quite often you will see these cars used with &quot;new engines&quot;. Beware! They may not have been cared for the best. Most likely, poor maintenance habits led to a blown turbo, to a damaged engine. 
  
  If you feel comfortable keeping the car well maintained, oil changed regularly, and perform regular maintenance, this car can be trouble free and very enjoyable. I highly, highly recommend this sports car for the person who wants a fast and fun ride.
