            Once I drove and purchased this car, I knew why the Jetta was called the BMW for the working person. It has all the luxuries and amenities of a more expensive car of the same size, but costs MUCH less. VW's have always been known for their dependability, and though repairs are *slightly* higher priced, overall the number of repairs needed over the life of these cars are negligible. There are many, many standard features that in other cars are option only, at a much higher price. My fully loaded GLS was approximately $20k and came with wonderful standard warranties including 12 yr/unlimited mileage rust/corrosion, and a standard 2yr/24k bumper to bumper and 100k/10yr power train. Extended warranties available too!<br><br>
