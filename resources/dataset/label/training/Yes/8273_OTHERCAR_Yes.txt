            First of all, if you are like a lot of people I know who just hate small cars, go buy something else! If you want something to get you to work, this is a good choice. I read another review where someone complained about not being able to go over 85. I've never been on a road where I wanted to go 85 or could go 85 legally anyway. But the fact that it's powered by a 3 cylinder engine made by a motorcycle company (Suzuki) is compensated for by it's being light. I've never had a problem pulling into highway traffic or passing a slow moving vehicle. I also read one where the roominess was a complaint. I don't get it. When I borrow my Dad's mid-size car, I either have to put the seat so far back I barely have control of the pedals, or so far forward that my head hits the curved roof. And the hatch back has allowed me on occasion to haul more yard sale stuff than my Dad's trunk would ever hold. As for reliability, you MUST keep good clean oil in a small car! I've skipped a few recommended oil changes and only now, at 130,000 is it starting to burn about a quart every 2 months. I've also had problems with the muffler, it's mounted a little low and if you overload the car it can scrape bottom. But I've had no major work done to it yet. And much of the minor stuff, like spark plugs, etc. is so easy to get to in the very roomy engine compartment that I'd be embarrassed to pay someone else.
I understand that the newer models are quite different so don't take this review to apply to all Metro's but a low mileage used Geo Metro would be a good bargain for most economy minded buyers.<br><br>
