            In December, I traded in my Chevy Blazer for the new Nissan Xterra.  That was the best trade that I could have made.  I love the Xterra, because of its rugged look, and the ride that gives is a bit more stiff than the ride of the Blazer.  I wanted to feel like I was driving an SUV, since that was what I was looking for.  I had trusted a dealer friend of mine enough to purchase the Xterra sight unseen.  When she brought it to me I absolutely loved it.  I have the metallic silver model, and the color is fantastic.  I have had the chance to use it in the snow this winter and like the way it handles.  It seems that the tires are larger and the vehicle stands a bit taller than most of its size.  I enjoy the rugged look that it has, as opposed to looking like a regular car.  The inside is a little plain against the GM models ie......no thermometer, no compass,no digital readings in my model, but I guess that is less to worry about when it comes to things going wrong.  I would recommend this ride to anyone looking for a great vehicle.<br><br>
