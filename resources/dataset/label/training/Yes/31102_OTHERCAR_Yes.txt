            I LOVE my jeep! I would not trade it in for anything!

I live in the northeast where we get lots of snow and this baby plows through the snow with no problems! I have never got stuck with my jeep!

There is sooo much room in it. the backseat folds down to give even more room. I used it when we moved and we packed everything in no problem.

My jeep is from 1997 and it still looks brand new. It has a full size spare tire, great cd player with cool speakers(this all came with it!)

The tires are big so it stands tall over most other cars on the road.

The onl thing some people might not like, but I LOVE, is the fact that the jeep drives like a jeep. When you hit a bump you move all over the place inside. Its not the smoothest ride in the world but that is why I love it so much. It feels like a jeep and drives like one. The grand cherokee is nice but drives too smoothly.

I highly recommend the jeep cherokee. For those who want everything in a SUV but without paying $30,000 or more for it, this is the SUV for you!<br><br>
