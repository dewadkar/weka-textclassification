            <B>Digital</B> photos are a great invention for me.  I take
tons of family snaps.  Being able to bundle them into 
email saves me time and money.  I used to have to develop
pictures, look at them, decide which ones to reprint, 
wait for the reprints, then address and mail them to
Grandparents, cousins, Aunts, Uncles and other friends.
Now I can snap a pic, download and attach it to an
email that goes out to a list of interested people.
And after the initial cost of the camera, they are 
essentially free.

<B>My </B>Father-in-law gifted me his old digital camera
when he got a new whizzy one.  Although the old one 
worked, it was a lot of work.  The back won't stay 
latched, the download was painful and the resolution 
poor.  Also, there was no flash.  It was one of the 
very first digital cameras and showing it's age.  
Still, free is a very good price!

<B>When </B>I saw a recent deal at Staples to get the Agfa
CL18 for $69 after rebate, I jumped on it.  It has a
flash and also a direct USB connection to my PC.  
Looked like a great replacement for my relic.

<B>The </B>package arrived the next day (Staples has
GREAT delivery).  I eagerly opened the box.  We had
adopted a new dog over the weekend and everyone was
emailing me asking what "Rocket" looked like.  It
would be easier to mail them a photo than describe 
his silky golden retriever hair and beautiful gold 
eyes.

<B>Installing </B>the software was about a 40 minute deal.
I was surprised, but it turns out there were a lot of
included programs.  The system had to reboot several
times in order to get the drivers in, so it took some
time.  Included were the award winning Corel Print 
Office and Photo House programs.  There is a Twain
driver for the camera, as well as a Video for Windows
driver.  The installation gave me Microsoft NetMeeting
and ArcSoft Video Impression.  The Agfanet Print 
service also tagged along for the ride.

<B>What</B> is all that software doing on my disk for
this puny, lightweight, 32 image camera?  With only
2 MB flash non-removable memory, what features could
this camera have?

<B>Feature Highlights</B>
<B>o</B> Resolution 640x480 pixels (not so great)
<B>o</B> Built-in flash and self-timer
<B>o</B> Video capture at 15 frames/second using
ArcSoft Video Impression
<B>o</B> VideoConferencing using MS NetMeeting
<B>o</B> USB interface - great improvement over a flash 
memory reader for downloading photos to PC
<B>o</B> Video out plug for connecting to your TV - you 
can display the photos and slide shows on your television
<B>o</B> LCD status display 

<B>Time</B> to try it out.  My dogs hammed it up for the
camera.  I got a great wind blown shot of Bongo and 
Rocket under the trees.  I sent it off in email to rave
reviews.  The whole process took less than 5 minutes 
and that included posing the dogs. 

<B>I </B>also tried the video capture and playback.  This
feature is serviceable but 15 frames/second isn't
real time.  It would be interesting for seeing family
members from afar but not for capturing video you want
to save and replay over and over.  Being able to view
the slide shows on your TV is a nice feature.  After
family get togethers, you could gather 'round the set
and decide which to add to the family website.

<B>Bottom</B> line on this camera is that it will work
for my needs - snapping the family and dogs.  The low
cost allows me to pack it on outings without guilt
over possible breakage.  If you're looking for pro-
quality photos, look for a higher resolution camera.
If you're feeding the Grandparents "cheap shots", this
may work for you.
