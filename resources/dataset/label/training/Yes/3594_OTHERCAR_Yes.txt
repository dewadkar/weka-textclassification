            Silly for me to repeat probably what has already been said, but suffice to say, the G-2 builds on my already strong confidence in Canon products with my AE-1 S.L.R. still going strong, the plunge into "Digital" was an easy one with the G-2. Easy to learn, though at first the G-2 may seem daunting in its' operation. Manual,Aperture,Shutter priority modes along with a host of white balance settings and all the functionality anyone could ask in a small easy to take package. My trips to the Petersen Automobile museum and Chino Air Museum and frequent Hockey game photo trips were well preserved on the G-2. No operational glitches whatsoever. If there were errors, than I was the cause, and not the G-2. Color saturation is quite good, as its' detail and dynamic range in getting details out of the shadows are well done. I continue to impress friends and family with my photos taken on the G-2. I am a newcomer to this terrific hobby and the G-2 never left me wanting for a better small ready for action camera. Perfect?? No, of course not. The battery is proprietary,so AA batteries cannot be used if your main battery dies,keep a spare just in case. The LCD could be bigger too. The Zoom is stingy too. The Olympus C-series camera hits the 8x zoom mark here for instance. The manual focus mode is done poorly as well. Some program modes in the shutter/Aperture priority are limited in scope. Being a rangefinder, there is no through the lens viewing. This certainly will not impress the professionals I know. Given these concerns, the Canon G-2 is just fine.  Recommended for those seeking a great relatively small camera with very good functionality,and photo quality.
