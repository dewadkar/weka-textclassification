            Well, these cars look sporty, and are about the cheapest sporty car you can buy.

When I first bought it, it would sometimes stall, or not start after sitting for a few minutes (turn the key all the way off, then it will!) . Also, when it did that, you could hear a "click" somwhere under the hood, sounds like on the right side (from driver's seat). For some reason, it stopped doing this, and always starts, never stalls anymore. The only parts I have replaced is the valve cover gasket (this had a chunk missing out of it, it was actually that "goop", not an actual gasket), and the radiator (which was plastic and aluminum, I replaced with an all-metal radiator). I think it had a leak in radiator when I bought it, but i did not inspect it as well as I should have. By the way, this is a 1.8 litre, bas-model eclipse. I got it for only $1600! Not bad, A?

Other stuff that needs fixed: stock alarm stopped working, driver window comes out of the track when rolling up, the hatchback shocks don't work (broom handle! ;). Paint was faded badly in some spots, especially the hood.

It is a good, reliable, cheap car. I think it is OK for what I payed for it. I have only $2000 total in the car, with the repairs included.

By the way the 1.8 litre is NOT FAST! (actually, it's peppy enough though, I can pass people no problem, and I've beat a few Hondas in races, it's just not as fast as the 2.0 DOHC, and the turbo is alot faster then this 1.8). It just looks sporty, and gets 25-30 miles a gallon. You must use premium fuel, or it knocks. Speaking of noise, valves tap, until it gets warmed up, and the top end gets coated well with oil (about the first 10 minutes of driving it the first time of the day).

Personally, I love this car. I am going to buy a turbo later, around the same year (1990-1994) I like'em!

Update: the sqeaking was the alternator going out. It finally went out completely, this drained my battery, so I had to get another battery as well.

Update: The clicking sound and stalling was the computer going out. I found out they have capacitors that leak and ruin the computer. The computer retails for $919 new from mitusbishi, and they don't stock it! I found a used computer for $85.00. Also, I found out how to get the parts to rebuild they computer, parts are $15, labor is $30.

Honestly, most of these problems are because the previous owner never replaced any of these things. That's a used car for ya. Total I have $2325 in the car (including the car and all the work I've had done to it). Not bad for a 1992. It runs great, and I'm happy with it (if anything changes I will let you know).

FYI: These cars have lifters in them that start to "tap" quite easily. It's because the lifters have small holes in the top, that don't let oil flow to the top that well. It doesn't hurt the car too much, but can be annoying. You can either just run thick oil, or get the new improved lifters from Mitsubishi. Do it yourself is about $60-$100. Or, for a shop to do, somewhere around $200.

Email me if you need help finding good deals on the computers, etc..
