            Preface to the review: 
Upon going back to that warm July day in 1990 here is what I recall: I was p.o'd at my current car (I couldn't afford 5 cars then, only 3 and I drove a lot then too)a 1988 Chrysler 5th Avenue. Everything that could break did and even more stuff begin to break.  I knew I was going to need a new car. I was at my parents home in NC and was moving back east from Oceanside, Ca. I knew a Truck was in order. I had herd of explorer, but that was it. I was all set to buy another Chrysler. But this time it was Blue Jeep Cherokee. Then, I saw it. I drove by the Local ford dealer and there was a shiny Black with tan Ford Explorer. I make a quick U-turn and came back. After looking at it for a few moments I was hooked. I drove it and knew it was mine. Plus it was 2,000 thousand cheaper than the Jeep and was an Automatic. I took the Jeep back and Sat my behind in the nice leather seats. Comfy I thought. After another 25 minutes I signed the dotted line. I was in love. My wife (now ex) thought I was nuts. She wanted an Aerostar. This was my first Explorer. I still have it and it still runs with well over 300,000 thousand miles. I lost the title a few years ago during a move and have no reason to find it. 
Drive train:
Although My Chrysler was a V-8, my explorer was much more powerful. The 4.0 V6 had good stop light racing power. I could easily lay a little rubber down on the earth. The transmission shifted smoothly. It got good gas mileage and it still does. Around 21 MPG on highway trips. It handled well and road well. It had Firestone Radial ATX tires then and I couldn't believe how car like it felt. It road well. Better than the wife's Saab. I even liked how the Touch Drive 4wd worked.
Interior:
The leather seats handled my 3 kids well. The back seat was long and flat, so a car seat fit well in the middle position and the other two sat in the outboard positions. The front seats where comfortable enough when I drove it across the US that first time (it's made 6 cross country trips in its life). I loved the interior. It hid dirt well. The radio worked well, until it broke. Replaced it and it worked great again. The A/C was another story. Because mine was Black, it was hot in summer. The A/C worked well, when it worked. Ford has made many repairs to it free, simply because I have documents back to 1990 when it broke and it was a warranty problem. Now that's gone, but the A/C seems to be doing well. The sun roof is nice and I am glad its not power. 
Durability:
It was a first year car. So it has had a few more problems than usual. Mainly A/C issues. I have had 2 transmissions put in it, but one was at 93K and the other was at 212K. I just had a minor engine rebuild with 325,000 miles on it. I have taken better care of the third transmission. I have had an alternator and 2 water pumps put on. Plus a fuel pump and a few other sensors. But that's It. Total of all maintenance to date: $7,894.29, Not Bad for the age and mileage.
