            I have had this car for over 4 years now. I had the luxury of testing out other comparable sport cars in it's class before I purchased this baby. This is the summary of my report: The Z is not the best in it's class but it does combine many of the strong points of other sports cars without taking on their flaws.

Comparable cars:
'93+ Mazda RX-7
The Z has the nimble feel and turn ratio of the RX-7. It is also comparable to the RX-7's almost lack of turbo lag. You can feel the increase power generated by the turbo's the moment you drop you foot on the pedal.

'93+ Toyota Supra
The Z is comparable to the supra in terms of trunk space and it's targa roof setting. The Z allows you to pop the tops and ride like a convertible minus the insecurity and structural deficiency.

'93+ Mitsubishi 3000GT vr4
The Z is a very comfortable sports car. Unlike the stiff suspension system of the RX-7 and Supra, the Z has a ride very much like the 3000GT when the setting is on touring mode. The suspension stiffness is easily adjusted via a switch on the center control panel. (Sport & Touring) On sport mode, the suspension drastically stiffens although I feel that handling does not improve by much.

91+ Acura NSX
If you look at both car's interior, you would notice that they are very similar. The Z and NSX has a dashboard that slopes upward from the passenger toward the front of the car resulting in a "roomier" feel. The front windshield for both cars connect to the chassis lower than the Mitsu, Mazda and Toyota. This results in a bigger front view. You tend to see more of the road in front of you than the other cars. 

Durability wise, I have performed the maintenance work as scheduled (Fuel filter, Timing belt, water pump) and found that they are very expensive, however not much more than you would expect to pay if you had any of the cars mentioned here.
The only problem I ever had mechanically or electrically; Since this car has 5 computers to ensure complete overall operation of the vehicle, beware when any of them should break. My fuel modulator shorted out resulting in a complete fuel cut-off to the engine. I had the car towed and it took awhile for the mechanics to trace all the electrical wiring to determine the problem. 
The chassis and suspension system of this car is incredibly strong. For those who travel on poor road conditions, the Z is unlike it's Japanese namesake "Fairlady". I once hit a three quarter foot high lane divider curb in New York city and went flying over the curb to the other side of the street and landed amid a shower of sparks underneath. I got out and visually inspected the vehicle and there were no visible damage. I took the car in the next day for an undercarriage check. The results of the check revealed that the car had no undercarriage damage except for scratches. The mechanic told me that even the alignment came out fine and did not need adjustments.
Why is this car an excellent buy? The Z is a very durable sports car and has a loyal following nationwide, where you can obtain parts and advice from the Z groups. In the long run, that would be the most compelling reason for the Z owner considering that these cars can only be bought used, in the United States.
