            I am the happy owner of a 1991 Nissan Sentra SE-R. I am the second owner and am not surprised in the least that my car won Car and Driver's 10 best for every year it was made (91-94). The SE-R made several improvements over the other Sentra models such as 15-inch sport alloy wheels and the best part about this car: the engine. Instead of a wimpy 1.6 liter engine Nissan dropped a 2.0 liter 140-horsepower high-revving gem. This car will beat cars off the line costing twice as much. (Find out all you want to know at http://www.se-r.net). The original purchase price was about $13,000.

The news is all pretty much good for this car. I just got $600 in service done last week and for a car nearly 10 years old and with 80,000 miles that isn't bad. Other than new tires and a new muffler this latest repair has been the most expensive to date. Very reliable. I had some caliper work done in the rear, AC recharged, passenger window lubricated (was very sticky), and an instrumentation light bulb was replaced. This is my history with the Sentra.

But the tale continues. My mother just purchased a 2000 Sentra SE. Same engine, but with 4 doors, a new design (from previous model year) and some nice touches like 16-inch alloys, moonroof, spoiler, small ground effects and a double tailpipe. Having had a chance to drive the new car, I have found for the most part I prefer my older SE-R. Sentras are economical, fun to drive, and reliable. My '91 gets close to 35MPG on the highway, and the new one is rated at 29MPG. 

My family and I have had great luck with Nissan cars (and trucks!) and would highly recommend the Sentra for anyone looking for a solid car that will last forever.<br><br>
