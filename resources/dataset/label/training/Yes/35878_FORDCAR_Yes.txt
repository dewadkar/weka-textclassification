            We purchased a 1993 Ford Aerostar used when I was pregnant with our 3rd.  Boy did we pick well.  We got lucky and got a van with built in kids seats.  Yeah.  We still use them for kid #4.  

Anyway, at the time of purchase we owned a small pop up trailer, so anything we bought had to be able to pull it.  This van did so, and now pulls an even bigger pop up and a 20ft sailboat.

I love this van for it's space.  As I said, we camp and sail.  We can pack this vehicle so full of stuff and still have room for the six of us.  The way back area is sooooo huge.  We travel with a dorm fridge and it sits back there with room to spare.  The space is also great for big trips to the store.  When you take the seats out, a couch fits in.  How many mini vans can say that.

Another benefit in this van is the rear air/heat.  The kids or the driver can control it.  It heats up and cools down quickly for a big vehicle.

We have had no major mechanical problems with our van.  Of course we have done the normal maintenance all along the way.  Frequent oil changes, brakes, hose, wires, spark plugs.  Now we have over 100,000 miles on it and my husband says he's never known a car with so many miles to run so well.

If you can find a used Aerostar, within you budget.  Go For IT!
