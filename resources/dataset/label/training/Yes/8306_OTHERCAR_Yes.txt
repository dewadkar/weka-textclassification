            I hadn't planned on a buying a new car for a few months, but when I suddenly crashed my old car into a tree, I was forced to make a quick decision.  I test drove the Corolla first, then a Nissan Sentra.  

Exterior:  The body style on the 2003 Corolla is updated from the 2002.  It is much sportier.  It has the appearance of a small Camry.   My car is bright white, with black trim.   

Interior:  I have a tan interior.  For some reason, my car did not come with floor mats, maybe the dealer just forgot to put them in.  It is a very comfortable car.  The only thing I don't like is that the Hazard Lights button is right below the CD player and I keep turning them on accidentally.  I guess I'll get used to it.  The rear seat will fold down to give you added space in your trunk.  I was impressed with the amount of leg room in the Corolla, as opposed to the Sentra.  

I am a college student and will be commuting every day.  I bought this car because it was affordable, while still providing  me with safety and comfort.
