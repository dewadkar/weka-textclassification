            If anyone is looking for a reliable used car, a Honda Accord is a great choice.  After having had two Nissans (a 1989 240SX and a 1993 Maxima) that barely made it to 100,000 before having a multitude of problems, I bought a 1991 Honda Accord 4-door EX.  It had over 173,000 miles when it was bought and after about a year and a half it now has over 225,000 miles.  The most trouble that it's given me is that I've had to get the brake pads replaced and a small leak in the clutch system.  (Overall costs were less than $200!).  This car amazes many mechanics who hear about it, and has impressed this owner very much.  I will continue to buy Honda's based on that fact that this car is the most reliable one anybody in our family has ever owned.
     Aside from the reliability, this car drives very well.  It has a smooth ride with little wind noise.  The acceleration isn't that of a Dodge Viper, but it's no 55-hp Geo Metro, either.  The gas mileage is also a plus with this car as it gets close to 30 miles per gallon in combined highway and city driving.  And, if you're a music fan, the stereo does a good job, too.  (The Clarion cd player helps that out, though.)  As far as safety in a wreck goes, I don't have any experience, but this is a great car for any parent to buy for a teenager.
