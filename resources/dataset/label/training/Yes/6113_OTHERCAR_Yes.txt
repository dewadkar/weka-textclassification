            I recently bought my new 1999 Chevrolet Impala after much looking.  I had wanted a car this size for a long time.  I considered the Chevrolet Malibu, Accuras, and Toyotas.  My second choice would've been the Chevy Malibu, but there was no room in the back seats and that's what I needed most seeing as I carpool a lot.  

I have been pleased with this car ever since I bought it.  The price wasn't way overpriced, and for all the things it comes with, was worth it.  Regular features including air conditioning, anti-lock breaks, power steering, locks, and windows.  The one I purchased also came with a cd player.  The car is easy to drive, it runs great, and is very safe.  Child locks in the back seat and plenty of room for a car seat.

All around this car is a great buy.  I would recommend it if you want to spend the money for a wonderful car.<br><br>
