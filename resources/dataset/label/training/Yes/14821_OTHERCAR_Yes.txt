            I was waiting for the economic uncertainties to settle before buying a car. But it was taking too long and the economic uncertainty seemed more permanent than temporary. So I took the decision of buying  an old car. Taking Mazda 98 was not a pre decided choice. I just came across a person selling the car at a price that seemed reasonably low. The car had 96000 miles and was being offered for  $3000. 

I did not know the driving at the time of buying the car. So I took the help of a friend to check the vehicle and take a test drive. 

<b> Engine </b> The 98 Mazda Prot�g�  DX Automatic has 1.5 Liter , 4 cylinder engine that develops 95 horse power.  The engine is fine for normal uses including that for highway entry. But it falls  short  of the requirements of  power enthusiasts. 

<b>Exterior</b> 
I was impressed by the exterior appearance of the car.  It has an impressive look. The FM / AM radio , CD player and the four speakers make up a good sound system.  The vehicle can easily accommodate three passenger in the back in addition to two in the front. There is enough room to spread legs. The Mazda Prot�g� 98 DX uses 13 inches tires. The subsequent models of 99 and onwards use 14 inch tires. There is a little less wear and tear with 14 inch tires as compared to 13 inch tires.

<b>Mileage</b> The mileage of the Mazda Prot�g� was observed about 26 mpg. On long driving the mileage was close to 30 mpg. This is quite good considering that is was an old vehicle. This is when my car is of automatic variation. The manual variation will offer even better mileage. Considering other cars in this range,   Mazda offers better mileage.

<b>Value for Money</b> In terms of value for money , Mazda Prot�g� offers an excellent choice. The car has a number of pros including fuel economy , outlook , reliability that out weight its shortcomings of a seemingly low horse power of automatic variation. I am not sure exact  price  of the brand new models of Mazda prot�g� but I am sure it offers a good value for the money.

<b>Model Variations</b> The Mazda Prot�g� comes in three flavors DX , LX and EX. The DX and LX have 1.5 Liter engine and has 92 horse power. The EX model has 1.8 Liter engine that develops 122 horse power. The LX model being the luxury , has many additional features over the DX model. This includes 14 inch tires instead of 13 inch tires of DX , central window buttons and many other features. I had only the DX models so I am not able to exhaustively list what those additional features are. But the manual describes the all the features and details of the LX as well as DX model.

<b> Latest </b> My mazda started giving problem. It was showing  a hot engine. By the time I obseved it the alternator had gone. I took it to mechanic who told  that the problem was due to the jerk in the radiator and the radiator was damaged. He asked $1600 for repair !!! Instead of getting it repaired I sold it for $1600.

That makes me rate Mazda from 4 stars to 3 stars. And this is my view.
