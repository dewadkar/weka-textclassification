            What struck my attention first? While it was an older car and boxier than the newer ones, it had a certain amount of style to it that I knew that I would appreciate as long as the car lasted. Now after a year and a half I still enjoy it.
First of all, and, an important fact for anyone who does not have money to waste on gas, the Sonata has very good gas milage.  I get about 33 miles to the gallon, highway driving.
The car itself is very comfortable with plenty of room in the front and back seat for almost anyone, no matter how tall or large.
My model is not loaded, but does come with air conditioning as well as a tape deck.  All of the controls in the car are placed within easy reaching distance and in places that make sense. 
The car is super reliable, in the time that I have had it nothing has gone wrong at all. With standard oil changes and tune ups this car has given me not a seconds worry.
Although it is not a large car, it alludes to spaciousness and is very secure feeling. The ride is smooth and quiet and the car itself handles beautifully in any kind of weather or road condition. Living in New England that was a big concern of mine, and a fear that turned out to be needless.
All in all there is very little that I can fault this car with. I plan to keep this car until it dies, and will most likely invest in another at that point.
