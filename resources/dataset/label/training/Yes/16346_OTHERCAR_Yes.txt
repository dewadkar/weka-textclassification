            The new Hewlett Packard HP PhotoSmart C200cl Digital Camera is a great digital camera for beginners who want a reasonably priced camera and also want to be able to take great pictures with it. This was my first purchase of a digital camera and to tell the truth I knew nothing about what to look for in a digital camera. I went to several stores looking at different models and after reading the brochure on this camera I decided to give it a try. 

I am certainly glad I did. I am not extremely electronically inclined but the instructions were very simple to understand and in no time at all I was taking pictures like a pro. It has a 1megapixel, which at the time I knew nothing about but it just means that your picture turns out more real and a very solid plain photo. 

It also has a 2x digital zoom for close up shots and I like to take pictures of wild animals and this comes in really handy to get a close up without scaring them away. You can store up to 40 photos also and that is great. When you put your pictures into the computer then you can erase the ones you have on the camera or you can keep some and delete the others. I really like that feature as it makes it faster to download your pictures according to how many you have on the camera.

 If you are looking for a digital camera I would highly recommend this one, especially if you would like a great camera and an easy to use camera too.<br><br>
