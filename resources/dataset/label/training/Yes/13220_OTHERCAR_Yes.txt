            We bought a 1999 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE in February and thus far have been very pleased with it. We have driven it approx. 23k miles which includes a trip to California and several trips to Nevada.  The van is very roomy and it is very nice to be able to crawl in the 3rd seat and sleep while on a long trip. The only problem we have had so far is the cruise control doesn't work properly. It fails to keep the speed up when going up inclines. We bought the infinity stereo and it is awesome. Everything else on the van works as it should. Our 3.3L V6 is more than adequate for uphill climbs and the van cruises nicely at 75-80 mph. Handling is responsive for a van of this size as is the acceleration. I would recommend this van for a family of 4 and up. I have 2 kids and nothing is nicer than letting them have their own space on a long trip. I also like the extended grand voyager due to the amount of space it allows. Very much worth the extra money for the extra space. Gas mileage averages around 25 in city and 28 on highway, not bad!  All in all we are quite happy with the van although we plan to trade it in for a Durango due to needing the towing ability of the suv.

Update: We have now had our van for 1 1/2 years and have over  43,000 miles on it. We have had no major problems with it, I still have the trouble with the cruise control, but it never bothered me enough to take it in under warranty. I am still eyeing the Durango, but will most likely have to wait until early next year to trade in. We have been very pleased with our van and would have no problem with purchasing another one. <br><br>
