            The Acura MDX is the most unassuming, nimble, and cost-effective luxury SUV we can find. We traded our 01 for the 03 when Acura upped the horsepower and added a rear-view camera. After looking at the late-comers to this group, we still bought another MDX.

The buying experience was a different story. Sad to say it took a while to convince the dealer to allow anything off the sticker for customer loyalty. And this was our THIRD Acura purchase from this dealer! Why tarnish a great vehicle with a greedy sticker-price policy?

The MDX looks good, but not flashy, which is why it is not stolen as much as other bling-bling SUV's. The insurance costs are low for the category.

The materials, fit and finish are superior in it's class, and the ergonomics are well thought-out, except for the slide-roof controls being only on the driver side and not accessible to the passenger. The navigation system is easy to use (one DVD instead of a multi-changer for each region), easy to view (the screen is a large, letterbox format), and very current. The sound system is great (Bose) and the multi-disk changer loads right into the dash, avoiding the hassle of loading a multi-disk cassette in the trunk.

The leather is of great quality, and able to withstand abuse by two boys and a beagle on long road trips. The front and second row seats are comfortable for long trips, but we wish the 2nd row would recline. The third row seat is adequate for two adults or three kids in a pinch, although it only has safety belts for two.

Cargo space is good with the fold-flat third row seat. We can fit four sets of golf clubs, luggage for four, and all sorts of miscellany, including a cooler in the rear.

The ride is quiet, nimble and the vehicle drives like a car.  The gas mileage on the highway averages around 21 mpg with the vehicle loaded. In town, we get around 17mpg. 

We have a ski boat and trailer, totaling about 4000 lbs of towing weight. The Acura has no problem with the load, especially with the new 260 horse.

Now if they would only make it in a full-size...
