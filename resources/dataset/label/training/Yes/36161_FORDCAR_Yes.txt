            I purchased the Ford Focus 4-door model.  The truck space is HUGE!  Plenty of space in the back seat (we have three big boys!).  It comes with a single CD player, the best stereo system I've ever heard in a vehicle in this price range and everything is easily accessible to the driver and passenger.  The seats are comfortable and they will raise up or down for the driver.  The car drives nicely, very good braking system and suspension.  The down side to this car is this model does not come with a tilt wheel nor a center counsole to store items in.  The cup holders are placed under the stereo and do not hold big cups.  There is a place to hold two cups for the back seat passengers, but they are not high enough and the cups do tend to fall out.  So, make sure they had good lids on them.  The back seat does have a split fold down so you can carry long items in the car.  We actually put bi-fold doors into the car through the trunk with one part of the back seat folded down and they fit with no problem.  This is a good car for anyone who has a family or tends to be the designated driver for outings.  It is comfortable, roomy and my 15 year old son says it's &quot;fat&quot;!  A good car for the money.  I recommend this car.<br><br>
