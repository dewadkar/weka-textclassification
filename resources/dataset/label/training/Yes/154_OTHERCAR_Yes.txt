            I still take a lot of pictures with a regular film camera, but only because of the inconvenience of getting prints from a digital camera.

The MX-1200 is considered a lower-end digital camera, but with the 1.3 megapixel resolution and the choice of 640X480 or 1280X960, my final prints are as good as my Nikon.

The camera has as many features as I could hope for including a &quot;wheel&quot; that selects the following:

<b>Setup</b>

<b>Quality</b>.. Normal-Basic-or Fine (note the the finer, the bigger the file size)

<b>File Size</b>.. 1280X960 or 640X480 (note the this effects file size and the ability to print larger pictures)

<b>Sharpness</b>.. Normal-Soft-or Hard

<b>Frame No.</b>.. Renew or Cont (If you erase the current pictures, the frame numbers can either restart at 0001 or continue adding)

<b>Beep</b>.. High-Low- or Off

<b>Date/Time</b>.. Set 

<b>Reset</b>.. Reset all of the above to the system default.

All of these functions appear clearly on the back viewing screen.

<b>Timer</b>..  For delayed shutter release

<b>Manual</b>.. To manually control Flash-White Balance- and EV-Contrast (Note that if you press the DISPlay button, you can preview the picture)

<b>Fully</b>.. Automatic All functions preset

All of the above shooting modes allow zoom-in/zoom-out plus great close-up capability.

<b>Review Picture</b>..One at a time or a screen fill..with zoom capability

<b>Trash</b>....Delete all or one at a time

<b>Protect</b>...One Frame-All-none

<b>PC-Mode</b>...For slow transfer to a saved jpg file

Do not try to use anything but NIMH rechargeable batteries (got them on eBay with charger for $15) as these last for many sessions.  Akaline barely last for 20 pictures (more if you use the 648X480 mode).

I also replaced the 4MB SmartMedia with an 8MB from eBay (about $15).

The AC adapter is also available on eBay for about $19.

I bought the case from Fuji $5 plus $5 shipping.  They have a bigger case for $10.
