            The rear wheel drive C-class is very comfortable.  I bought this vehicle because i wanted a sedan with class and speed.  Mercedes small sedan line is nothing short of the sporty SLK power, they are well built and provides quiet comfortable driving.  My C-class is great when it comes to handling.  My supercharged 2.3 liter fits my needs just fine with 185 hp which is more than enough for this upscale car.  The different trim lines are the C230 and the C280.  My body style is a 4 door, which is the only kind that the C-class provides.  The prices range from 31,750 to 35,950 dollars, a small price to pay for a package that packs so much into a small sedan.  If you're a business man like me who likes upscale cars with a bit of speed, then the C-class is the car for you.  However, I do not like the noisy brakes, but that is the only problem I have had so far with my Mercedes.  Overall, this sedan is comfortable, quick, and fun to drive.<br><br>
