            I had been shopping the 'net looking at different digital cameras to see what all was out there.  I had asked questions, etc., to find out what all I would need to have a good camera.  So, I sort of knew what to look for when I did decide to purchase one.  I was in local Wal Mart and asked the salesperson if they had any digital cameras.  She told me that the HP c200 had come in that day.  I read the box and saw it had everything I needed and more:  I bought it.  It even had really easy to install and use software and that was a big plus.  The price was right, too.  It cost $298.00 and came with everything.  Why did I purchase it?  The price and what it came with.  I have benefitted greatly from this camera and feel that my family will too, after they see the calendars I made them for Christmas from photos I took Thanksgiving.  

I chose this camera over others because I was able to see it first hand.  It works good with my computer and my TV.  Sending one of its photos over the internet is not as easy as I had hoped:  either I don't know what I'm doing or the software needs to be more user friendly.  However, I highly recommend the HP 200C digital camera to any and all.
