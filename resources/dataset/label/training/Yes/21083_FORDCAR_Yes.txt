            We purchased our new Ford Windstar LX with V6 engine in May of 1999.  We had a compact car previous to this and wanted something bigger for our family, we have two small children.  

At first I absolutely loved our new minivan, it felt roomy, had almost all the options, and rode beautifully.  However, there were some things I immediately noticed I didn't like.  For instance in my opinion the cup holders are not sturdy enough.  The styrofoam cups you get from purchasing drinks at fast food chains or convenient stores leak condensation after an hour or so and this drips on to the floor.  We had to put a placemat underneath the cup holders so the floor didn't get all stained and marked up.  Also our stroller that we keep in the back rear area barely fits.  We have to turn it sideways rather than flat in order for it to fit. This is extremely tiresome after getting two small children in the car as strollers are heavy. It takes a little maneuvering to get it to fit properly so the door shuts.  I would rather not keep the rear seat down flat all the time just so the stroller fits.  After all, one reason we purchased a minivan was for its rear seat. Also, because the stroller has to put in sideways the dirty wheels mark up the back of the rear seat. 

I had asked for a center console to keep miscellaneous items like car phone, pen, paper, tapes, etc.  The salesperson informed me that one is not available.  I was used to this in my compact car and it takes some getting used to not having one.  

Overall I am glad we purchased our 1999 Ford Windstar LX.  It rides nice, looks nice, and has lots of sitting space.  However, when you are going to look at new minivans make sure to pay plenty of attention to the little details.<br><br>
