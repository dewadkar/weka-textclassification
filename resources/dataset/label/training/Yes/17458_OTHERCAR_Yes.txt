             <b>M</b>aking its grand debut in the late summer of 2001, the Kia Sedona surprised pretty much every American in this country who had a chance to drive one of these plush, imported minivans. The Sedona is the first minivan ever to come from Korea. Expecting Hyundai to introduce the first minivan from Korea, it was Kia (owned by Hyundai) that introduced the Sedona. For 2002 the Kia Sedona comes in 2 trim lines, the LX and the EX. The LX being the base, and the EX being the top of the line trim with a multitude of options and standard equipment. 

 <b>It's about time</b> import minivans did not come with 4- cylinder engines, and tiny V6s that have to move around over 4,000 lbs of van & cargo. The Kia Sedona comes with a DOHC 3.5 V6 that has an adequate 195 horsepower and 218 lb-ft of torque. While not having the most power in its class, this is a standard engine, so you won't get caught in the cold with a 4-cylinder option just because some company decides to charge 10 million dollars extra for the V6 option. 

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

The Sedona <b>accelerates</b> quite well, especially for its 4,700lb curb weight. With 195 horses on tap, this heavy weight moves from the light with no problem, however a 10% increase in power or so would be appreciated. I'm not sure of the 0-60 time, but in my EX test van im guessing slightly less than 10 seconds. 
Hills are a snap for this vehicle, with the 5-speed automatic, down-shifting on steep freeway hills inevitably happens, but with this extra gear, the Sedona tackles these hills with much less fuss. I'm sure all of you minivan owners are familiar with the sudden down-shift with a 4-speed automatic from 4th down to 3rd while going up a hill, the RPMS jump to near 5,000  RPM! In the Sedona, the 5-speed allows the transmission to down-shift without such a harsh jump. The gearing is quite accommodating. <b>Cruising</b> at 65 MPH is hushed, RPM from the engine hovers in the 2,400 range. 

<b>Handling</b> is average. In the performance category, handling is not the Sedona's strong offering. But don't get me wrong, the steering allows for precise handling, just don't expect this minivan to handle any better than your current Ford Windstar or Dodge Caravan. 

<b>Braking</b> was excellent in my test van, an optional power disc front/rear drum dinosaur set-up was had, but this set-up had 4-wheel ABS, which assured quick stopping. 

<b>NOTE:</b> The only available engine in both the LX and EX is the 3.5 liter DOHC engine (this is a good thing, considering this is a great engine.) and the only Transmission is a 5-speed automatic (also a good thing.) Expect around 20-21 MPG on the freeway with conservative driving. Kia really needs to work on the EPA of this minivan. 20/25 would be much more acceptable. 

The 2002 Sedona rides on a relatively large 114" wheelbase, and is 119" long. The Sedona is of a unibody platform with rear anti roll bars. <b>Suspension</b> includes Macpherson struts up front, and a five link rear beam axle with coil springs in the rear.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

 Now to the Kia Sedona's super strong attribute; the <b>interior</b>. You would never know you were in a Kia if it wasn't for the Kia badge posted on the leather wrapped steering wheel. The Kia Sedona EX is the first vehicle I personally have ever driven from Korea that I can say that boasts world class characteristics.  This small van has everything anyone could ever want from the interior of a vehicle in this class. Amenities are plentiful, this van has more amenities than many entry level luxury cars. The 2002 Sedona EX comes with 10 cup holders, that's right 10!  The Sedona also comes with a trip computer, dual sliding doors, power everything, four captain chairs with a 3 seater bench in the rear; all rear seats can be removed. Dual air bags, dual glove boxes, dual AC, a digital clock, and there is so much more to this van. There is plenty of room in the Sedona for 7 passengers. The drivers seat is very supportive and comfortable . All seats were made of cloth and were a little rough, but not bad at all for a van in this price range, perhaps they just needed to 'wear in' a little. The drivers seat boasted 8 way power with lumbar supports, and the front passenger seat had 4 way power. Ergonomics are close to perfect, all the controls are simple for the driver to find, and are very 'night time friendly'; a great luxury for nightime drivers. 
The sound system was excellent. A cassette/CD player was an option that would have proved to be very accommodating on long trips where both tapes and CD's could be used. The most fancy part of the Ex Sedona is the simulated wood. There is a touch of wood that lines the center console, and the armrests where the power window buttons are located. Surprise, this simulated wood is not tacky! Unlike some vehicles that are overdone in fake tree meat, the Sedona's wood-trim is actually quite classy. 

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

  The <b>exterior</b> is one of the Sedona's weak spots. It's not by any means ugly, or even plain. It just looks like so many other minivans on the market today. There is really nothing that segregates the Kia Sedona from other minivans, like the Ford Windstar or Dodge Caravan. With the Ex you get a chrome grille, body colored moldings, and chrome door handles. These features separate the 'EX' from the 'LX' in the looks department. Flush mounted headlamps are fitted, tinted rear windows were an option, dual sliding doors, and fog lights give the face of the Sedona a slightly sporty edge. This fog light theme could have been more overdone to distinguish the Sedona from other minivans. Picture a 1998 Mustang Cobra's styled Fog lights on the Sedona (Who knows it might have looked cool). 

 The <b>Price</b> for the LX Sedona starts out at $18,000 or so. The EX around $21,000. With options though, this price can add up quite quickly. A power moonroof is almost a $1,000 option alone. 

Since this is a 2002 model I don't think anyone can comment on reliability quite yet, but Kia now has a 5 year, 60,000 mile 'bumper to bumper' Warranty, and a 100,000 miles powertrain warranty, so if anything goes wrong with your Kia Sedona you are covered for quite some time.


<i>Conclusion:</i>

While Fuel economy could be improved, the Kia Sedona offers excellent bang for the buck. This van is loaded to the brim with amenities normally found as options in other vans, all at a very generous price. If you are looking for a van in the less than $30,000 price bracket, the Sedona is worth checking out.
