            <i><b>An invaluable tool</i></b>
Recently we have been searching for a reasonable second vehicle. Though our search has yet to be rewarding I realized as I searched the various vehicle epinions what an invaluable tool this has been for me. Though professional reviews on vehicles claim to be unbiased ,when it comes right down to it nothing is as comforting as learning the <i>honest</i> opinions of consumers who own and drive a vehicle daily. Thus I am prompted to share my experiences with our <i>Ford F150 supercab</i>.

<i><b>Miss foreign car fanatic</i></b>
Let me begin by stating that I tend to be a dyed in the wool foreign car fanatic. Toyota, Nissan and especially Honda are terrific automobiles in my book. It's not that I wouldn't like to purchase an American automobile over the foreign product. I just generally haven't found American cars to be as reliable. The purchase of our <i>Ford F150 supercab</i> is doing wonders to change my views. Keep in mind that we have only owned our <i>Ford F150 supercab</i> for a year at this point, but thusfar we couldn't be more pleased.

<i><b>Reliability and size</i></b>
When we began our search for a primary family vehicle it was at a time when we could only afford one vehicle. Reliability was a crucial factor in our decision making process. We were also new to San Antonio Texas and noticed that most of the vehicles on the road out here are trucks. Now I'm not one given easily to peer pressure, but we quickly realized driving in San Antonio Texas is like taking your life in your own hands. We wanted as a bare minimum to even the playing field with these folks. 
Thus our search for a &quot;bigger&quot; vehicle.

Bigger in our case did not only apply to the exterior of the vehicle. We are a family of four, but being so far away from family we realized it was necessary that we have a vehicle that could accommodate our visiting relatives on occasion. We were getting rid of a van so the next feasible option was an extended cab truck which would seat six.

<i><b>Sticker shock</i></b>
Now I've already mentioned my love for foreign vehicles. When it comes to trucks a Toyota is hard to beat, unless you are looking for affordability. The pricetag on the Toyota Tundra quickly gave us sticker shock. As soon as we were able to get up off of the Toyota showroom floor we hurried across the street to check out the <i>Ford F150 supercab</i>. 

<i><b>Nicely equipped and affordable too!</i></b>
Despite our financial limitations we were pleasantly surprised with the options we were able to afford in our <i>Ford F150 supercab</i>. There are three models available in the <i>Ford F150 supercab</i> XL, XLT, and Lariat. The XL was pretty much bare bones and less than we were hoping for. The Lariat was fully loaded including such niceties as leather seats, but it was a bit steep for our budget. The XLT was just right giving us all the bells and whistles we hoped to find to include a power package, cruise control, tachometer, airbags with passenger airbag shutoff and an am/fm cassette stereo. We chose to purchase a 5 speed because we like the added power and control. We also purchased an 
aftermarket hard top cover for the bed of our truck in the factory color to protect anything we might put in the bed from the weather. 

<i><b>After a year how has our <i>Ford F150 supercab</i> fared??</i></b>
I mentioned in the beginning of this review that we couldn't be more pleased, but now I will elaborate with the specifics. When it comes to reliability we have had absolutely no problems with our <i>Ford F150 supercab</i>. In the year we have owned it we have racked up nearly 15,000 miles and it has yet to be in the shop for anything other than routine maintenance. Included in the 15,000 miles was a 13 hour road trip home to Tucson for Christmas. We toted a family of four and our Pekingese dog over 900 miles in comfort. The cruise control got a workout and performed flawlessly. The bed of our truck accommodated gifts and luggage easily.

Gas mileage has been excellent as well ranging from 25-30 miles per gallon. When it comes to being a functional vehicle this truck has exceeded our expectations. Not only is it big enough that we feel safe among the San Antonio drivers, but we find convenience in having a truck bed to haul home those must have purchases. Seating has been a plus too, with just the four of us we are absolutely comfortable. When relatives visit and we have to accomodate six it is cozy, but not unbearable.

<i><b>The only negative we have found in our Ford F150 supercab</i></b> 
With so many positives to share about this truck I hate to mention any negatives, but this review wouldn't be complete without it so here it is.
The only negative we can find in the <i>Ford F150 supercab</i> actually works both for and against it. 

That would be the way the rear door closes. Basically it is built so that you must shut the rear door first and the front door closes over it. The negative to this is that if you accidentally close the front door while the rear door is still open you end up banging the front door on the frame of the truck. Eventually this could lead to paint chips. Children have an especially difficult time understanding this concept. We alleviate this problem by making sure adults are the only ones to close the doors. 

This negative aspect of the doors can be viewed in a positive light being that it is like a built in child safety lock when driving. Since one door closes over the other you can be assured your rear passenger is not going to open the door while driving.

<i><b>A word of caution for those with small children</i></b>
If you place your car seat in the rear seats closest to the door please make sure you use caution in closing the doors to make sure little fingers are out of the way. We have noticed it could be very easy to unknowingly close a little hand into the rear door. We put our carseat in the center to avoid any chance of this happening.

In closing we have found this vehicle to be everything we had hoped for and more. We would strongly recommend it.
