            I've had 2 of this exact camera. I received my first one as a Christmas present 2 years ago. Unfortunately it was stolen by a dishonest moving company. I bought a new camera from the settlement money. I don't like the "newer" version quite as well. 

Both camera's have taken wonderfully sharp pictures. Only a handful of times have I ever taken a "bad" (blurry.. whatever) picture. It's a very simple point and shoot camera. Set the control wheel to the camera icon and start shooting away. No need to mess with focusing or anything. Preview your images on the build in LCD screen on the back and save your picture to disk. It couldn't possibly be easier. The LCD screen is SO CLEAR!! I've played around with other cameras where you could barely make out a face on the LCD screen. I can see my daughters cute little dimple on my LCD screen!!

This camera has a 2x zoom. I wish it had more of a zoom... While in the picture playback mode, you can zoom up to 4x previewing your pictures.

My one complaint with the "newer" version camera.. the menu. I much prefer the older style menu over the newer. The older had more options, I think it was better laid out. If I hadn't have had the older version, the new menu's would be fine - but I was used to the setup and layout and extra functions of the older style...

When I bought the newer camera, it came with a rebate for a 16 meg smart media card and a card reader. You DEFINATELY need a card reader with this camera!!! The uplink cable is incredibly slow... Also, I also recommend the larger media card - unless you really want to upload 6 pictures at a time...

I love this camera so much, I have made 2 people in my family buy the same camera - one is a real estate agent, the other an architect - and neither of them have regretted buying this camera.
