            I work for a Hyundai dealership and I can tell you that it is one of the safest cars on the road. They have two airbags, front and rear crumple zones, steel beams down both sides of the car and on the roof. They also have break-away motor mounts, which means you get into a head on accident the motor and transmition fall to the ground and not on your lap. The only other car that has that feature is the Volkswagon. Hyundai also has the best warrenty on the market, with 10 years/100,000 miles on your power train, 5 years/60,000 miles bumper to bumper, 5 years unlimited roadside assitanist. 

The Elantra is equipped with standard features like power windows, power locks, power mirrors, air conditioning, am/fm cassette radio and four doors. It is a great value for a family car. I give this car my seal of approval, expecally as a mother.<br><br>
