            I haven't bought this car yet, but I plan on doing it shortly.  I love everything about this car,from the optional 320 horsepower motor to the Bose CD player sound system.  Driving in this car is like feeling your in your own jet plane.  The only negative thing that I have found about the Camaro is that it is not a family car nor can you haul alot of people with you when you go somewhere.  But the Camaro isnt built for a typical family.  Even the gas mileage is real good to be pushing 320 horses.  Most people that buy this car is single people or couples with no kids.  If you want to look sleek in a new sports car and not be out alot of money, the Camaro is the car to buy!<br><br>
