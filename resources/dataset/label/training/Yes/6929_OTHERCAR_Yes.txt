Honda Insight is one of the first gasoline-hybrid vehicles. It combines a 1.0 liter, 3-cylinder engine and an electric motor. The electric motor is used to give extra power for passing, or hill climbing, and it is also used for the power steering. Mileage is what its all about and the fuel savings are a compelling reason to buy this car.  Compared to a SUV which gets 17mpg for 20,000 miles a year to Insight's 65mpg, you will save about $2500 per year.  Over a lifetime of 5 years and 100K miles thats more than $10,000 given that gas prices will rise further!!!! Incredible simple way to save money and be friendly to the environment.<br><br>
