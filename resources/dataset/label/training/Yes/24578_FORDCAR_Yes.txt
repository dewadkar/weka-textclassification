            All my friends were getting 4 door cars.  One friend bought an Accord, another a Camry.  Any who knows me knows that I am not a Accord/Camry person.  So having sold my Rodeo a couple of weeks earlier, I decided to try out another used car.  The Contour is slightly smaller than the two cars, which is fine for me, since I'm always in the driver's seat.  Most of the space is lost in the back seat area, especially in legroom.  I didn't want to get a car with 4 cylinders so I got the V-6 LX version with leather seats, automatic, power doors,AC, power windows, traction control, alloy rims and upgraded my stereo to a cool Sony unit with upgraded Boston Acoustics.  Try getting that (with only 32K) in a 3 year old Honda Accord for only 9K!

The v-6 is the one from the Ford Probe and Mazda 626 and it is a multivalve unit that pumps out a respectable 170HP.  It is a very smooth engine that loves to rev, however, it is poorly matched to the automatic. The autoshifter, which tends to upshift early and downshift late does not take advantage of the free-revving nature of the V-6 and at times feel anemic, due to it's fairly poor mid-range power.

There are alot of pros to this car other than the price.  The car has a strong AC system and traction controls helps in bad weather (not that I'd know, I'm from San Diego).  It also has a roomy trunk (for a family of 4) but the car is far from perfect though.

The car has a poor interior finish, leading to the plastics looking over plastic and the cup holder's broke as well.  The fit is also poor.  The main center console creeked everywhere and it became bothersome at times.  The factory stereo also produces some weak sounding notes.

Also, the check engine light came on right after I purchased the car.  However, it was a defective O2 sensor, so I don't really know if it was a big problem or not.

Oh another problem (although not a problem of the car itself or Ford)...it was broken into and stolen.  Now the car is somewhere in Tijuana....<br><br>
