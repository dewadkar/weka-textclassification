            I looked at a few other vehicles before purchasing my 2003 Forester XS. I was in the market for a smaller SUV or Wagon that would hold a fair amount of stuff for weekend trips to Home Depot and the like. Every vehical I looked at had some form of 4 wheel drive ( read articles on Edmunds.com that describe different 4 wheel drive systems)All Subarus are All-wheel-drive ( AWD). This feature is on all the time and does not require manually engaging when the weather turns bad. Here is a quick synopsis of the comparable vehicles that I test drove:

Hyundai Santa Fe
Nice looking vehicle but had very poor acceleration

Mitsubishi Outlander
Also nice but read reviews about lack of power and didn't pursue test drive

Ford Escape
Nice - ride was very smooth but definately more truck like. Rear was wide enough to hold a 4X8 sheet of dimensional lumber. The Escape was my second choice

Mazda Tribute
Built on same platform as Ford Escape so main difference was in trim appearance. Had a bizzare quirk in that you had to send the brake pedal almost to the floor before it engaged. This was enough for me to place this after the Escape

Now for the Forester
Looks - somewhat non-descript but I see that as plus as it won't look dated in a couple of years. My Forester is Silver which looks great but I would also consider the Black Mica which is black with gold flecks in the paint which gives it a different hue depending on the lighting. Chrome wheels and raised white letters on tires look a bit racey for this kind of vehicle.

Drive- Rides pretty much like a compact car. You do sit up a bit higher than a car but the Forester never feels "tippy".The seat adjustment has a wide up and down range which allows you to select the right feel for you. Visibility is very good all around. Forester handles very smoothly on most roads but deeply rutted roads will knock you around a bit. Forester has the best headlights I've ever owned on a car which is big plus for you if you live in a heavily deer populated area like I do. The XS package comes with foglights which do lay out a noticable blanket of light directly in front of the vehicle. Radio on same package includes a 6 CD changer and overall sounds very good for a stock sound system. Also standard on XS are heated seats which work very well.

Amenities
Rear seats fold down in a snap and you have a nice bed for lots of cargo. Get the cargo tray option which is a rubberized insert for the rear cargo area. Makes cleanup a snap after hauling a messy load. Lots of other little storage compartments all of the car.

Purchase
Subaru has a nice website that provides links to all dealers in your area. You can view each dealer's inventory with detail on options and pricing. I found most dealers willing to sell at $200- 500 over dealer invoice. After I did my test drives it was just a matter of surfing the web until I found the exact vehicle ( colors and options). The dealer I called gave me the price over the phone and we closed the deal on the spot.

In summary I  thought the Forester had the best combination of value, quality, comfort and saftey features ( Forester is top ranked in crash tests, AWD is standard as well as front and side airbags). In my opinion you can't go wrong with this vehicle.
