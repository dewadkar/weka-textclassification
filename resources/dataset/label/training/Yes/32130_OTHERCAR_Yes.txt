            I purchased my 2000 Daewoo Lanos about 6 months ago, and I'm very please with my purchase.  I selected the silver hatchback &quot;s&quot; model because I thought it was better looking than the sedan.

My Lanos has automatic and AC, and those are really the only options installed on my car.  The acceleration is good, however, the engine can get a bit noisy at the top end.  A word of warning:  The Air conditioning slows acceleration considerably.

Things I don't like about car:
The driver and front passenger seats are moderately comfortable.  The seats recline with a strange turning knob that I believe was probably a cost cutting measure.  The AM/FM is good, however, my lanos does have a rattle in one of the rear speakers.  I plan to get it repaired at my next scheduled maintenance.  Some of the plastic interior pieces seem to scratch easy.  Finally:  Daewoo is on unstable financial ground.

Things I like about my car:
The fuel economy is good.  I get roughly 26 mpg in heavy city driving.  The car handles very well.  The Heat and AC change the temperature inside the car to the proper level quite quickly.  The exterior styling is very charming.  I've actually had people come up and ask me what kind of car it is.  I also love the free service plan provided by Daewoo.

Conclusion:
You can't expect everything to be perfect in a cheap car.  After all, if the car was that great, it wouldn't be cheap.<br><br>
