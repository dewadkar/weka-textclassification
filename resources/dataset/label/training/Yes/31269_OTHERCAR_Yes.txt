            This review is for a GT automatic. This car was purchased with 79000 miles. So far the past 18 months of this car has been pretty good. Most people that have any knowledge about cars know the reputation about pontiac, of being cheap crappy cars. 

This does not seem to be all true. The positive about this car, for me at least, it is reliable. Also the car is heavy enough to be a good winter driver. The V6 engine has respectable performance. When you push the pedal down the car shifts down and pulls away with easy to a point. The engine with the automatic is almost impossible to reach the red-line, and if it does it makes so much noise it seems like it will blow up. Its just not very refined. 

Speaking of not refined, the interior. Entirely made of rubbermade. Very hard plastic, that when it is warm or cold shifts place and rattles horribly. Even with the standard 6 by 9 rear speakers, the car rattles and the side mirrors shake. However these things are expected on a car of this price.

If you are someone who is looking for a car with performance, good enough for city driving, not worried about the dash quality, and also enough trunk for just about anything, this would be a car to look into.
