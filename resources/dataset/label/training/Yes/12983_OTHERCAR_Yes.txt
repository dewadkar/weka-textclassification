            I put 800 miles on a rental which was showing 16k on the odometer.  Note that most rental cars see hard use, so that 16k is the equivalent of 30 - 40k.  I drove it on interstates, twisty two-lane roads, and city traffic.  This was a 4-door with automatic and ac.

This is a very basic car, almost as if it were a brand new car built in the mid 70's.  Level of equipment is minimal.  No power anything, but the only thing I missed in the end was power locks.  Basic AM/FM cassette and no cruise control.

Overall construction was solid.  There were no squeaks or rattles.  Materials used inside are cheap and feel it.  The dash in particular uses shiny, plastic that would have been used a few generations ago.  In the end, it doesn't make much difference.  There is a shallow indented area on the center of the dash to hold odds and ends, but is too shallow to hold items securely.  Vent controls are the usual and heat/vent/ac all worked fine.  Instrument cluster is basic with a speedometer, fuel guage, temperature guage, turn indicators and not much else.  Again, wasn't missed.  Switchgear was not bad.  Turn signal stalk seemed solid, as did wiper lever (note that the intermittent wiper speed is not adjustable).  Set fabric was some strange patterned cloth which felt decidedly utilitarian, but seems roadworthy.  Small armrest flips down for the driver.  Was actually more comfortable to use than it looked.

The car handles fairly well, being small, light and low to the ground.  Cornering is flat.  Suspension is decent, but does not like abrupt pavement breaks.  Brakes were poor, providing little power.  I did adjust to this after a few miles, but there's not much reserve for emergency braking.  Engine is underpowered, but accelerates adequately from a stop and can maintain good speed on the open road.  It does lose some speed on long, steep grades, at which point the automatic transmission kicks down abruptly.  Even then, there's not much power.

There was an intermittent loud (and very annoying) whine which crept into the cabin between 75 and 85 mph.  This would disappear above 90 (took this car as high as 95 for a couple of miles).  This may have been a loose piece of trim or something else resonating, and may be particular to this particular car.  If not, I suspect few who buy this car would be going that fast anyway.
