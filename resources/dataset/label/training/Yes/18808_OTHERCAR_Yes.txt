            I bought my Jeep Sport because i needed a bigger vehicle, I traded my 95 Nissan extended cab pickup, which I also loved, for my 98 Jeep,For a short legged person like myself the drivers seat is very comfortable, but for a long legged person it would only be tolerable for a few hours. I feel the Cherokee handles well, gives a comfortable and quite ride, and the gas mileage is pretty good also, I plow a rather large driveway and have found no problems with it handling it's job.
It has ample cargo area, but the back seat is very difficult for an adult to get in and out of. The towing capacity is 5000 lbs. but i have towed out a dual wheel pickup attatched to a 5 horse trailer with 5 horses in it,in low 4 wheel drive and i never spun a tire, i can put it in first gear and let off the clutch with no gas and it will go on it's own, then i can proceed to shift up gears with no gas and it goes right along, this  I have found it to be great if you are in slow moving traffic, it really saves on the clutch,I use mine for off road while camping and fishing trips and found it to be great as well, I could tell you some stories about this too, but wont get into them here.
I would recommend the Jeep Cherokee Sport to Families with small children,
elderly couples, and people who like to go off road for alittle fun.<br><br>
