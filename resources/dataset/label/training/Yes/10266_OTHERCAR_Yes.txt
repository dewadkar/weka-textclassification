            I did a lot of research before buying my 97 GLE in March of 1999.  I had made mistakes buying my previous car (hey, I was only 19 at the time!) but I learned from the experience.  I knew what to look for, and this car was it.

My Sentra is an automatic, with A/C, cruise control, front folding arm rest, a huge trunk for the size of the car, excellent gas mileage and the car's nice looking, to boot.  It had 29,000 miles on it when I bought it, and I feel like I got a great bargain.  The car rides well and has the comfort of a more expensive car, with a smooth-looking interior and easy-to-read displays.

The automatic transmission eats up some of the power, but it's got adequate oomph for city travel. I wouldn't want to climb mountains in this car, but I'd drive everywhere else in it. There is some slight road noise, but the ride is really pretty smooth.  Other cars in this price range sometimes have a hard, &quot;plastic&quot; feel to the ride, but not my Sentra.
