            Love it or hate it. That's what this vehicle is all about. You want compromise? Buy an SUV, not a Wrangler, because the only other "SUV" that hasn't compromised its purpose (well, not much) is a Hummer, and I won't even go there.

If you wince and whine when bouncing over bumps...if you can't control yourself (and therefore can't control the vehicle) when cornering...if you measure fun by miles per hour rather than hours per mile...if you need to wear a vehicle to convince others that you are a rugged outdoorsy type but then snivel about the outdoors (i.e., wind noise) intruding on your smug little metal-capsulized self...if you decry the lack of space in back of the rear seat but won't remove the rear seat...

...then buy something that <b>doesn't</b> have a short wheelbase and firm suspension, a tall boxy profile, a drivetrain favoring low-speed high-torque applications, a softtop, and a wheelbase and body meant for crawling up and down steep grades.

Really. There are so many other choices that to buy a Wrangler and then complain about what makes it UNIQUELY IT is downright ludicrous.

Impulse buying on this one will bite you in the butt. Do your homework thoroughly: test drive it, test drive other vehicles, go back and test drive it again, talk to other Wrangler owners and (especially) ex-owners, read as much as you can about it, list every vehicular need you have and highlight any that Wrangler cannot provide (such as towing a heavy trailer or seating for, umm, <i>large</i> people in the rear seat).

Straight off the lot without mods, this vehicle can do surprising things off pavement. Things such as purring up climbs littered with large rocks and holes dug out by others spinning their wheels...in 2WD! Things such as creeping down icy grades <i>sans</i> braking, in perfect control. The optional limited slip and standard 4-low range give this beast the manners it needs to go where other vehicles either can't go or go protestingly, admist much automotive histrionics.

I wouldn't have it any other way, jouncy ride and all.

<i>If only it weren't for that teeny little nagging question that persists at the back of my mind any time I'm somewhere remote: What's gonna break now?</i>

I bought my '00 in June 2000 and it is now September 2001. Drumroll, please, for the following warranty work I've had done so far:

* Vehicle arrived missing 2 bolts needed to install the softtop (which I only discovered after removing the hardtop to "unwrap" the softtop packaged within)
* Transmission began slipping out of 1st gear (*BANG!!!!*) early on. Got it replaced at about 3500 miles, thanks to a Technical Service Bulletin -- meaning this is a common problem with this vehicle model year.
* Valve cover gasket was replaced because it was leaking a small amount of oil.
* Engine began idling rough, a marked contrast to its original perfectly smooth purr. (Oh, yes, did I mention this engine has a sweet mellow sound at low revs, and the exhaust burbles upon deceleration are endearing, too...but I digress.) Dealer said there was another TSB out: adjust the computer codes.
* Left rear wheel had a dark stain in the rim. I guessed it was a leaking axle seal and went to the dealer again. Yup, that's what it was -- another TSB for that one!
* On a recent 4-wheeling trip, a loud noise started from the area of the front left wheel. (I stopped to check the obvious things such as lug nut tightness.) It eventually went away but I took it to the dealership. Guess what! Another TSB, this time for the transfer case torque shaft. Whether it actually fixed <i>my</i> noise I don't know, since it was intermittent anyway. Betcha that noise'll return the next time I take it 4-wheeling, GULP.

So we have, what, 4 TSBs plus 2 other warranty items in the space of 15 months? I'm not counting the bad tire or the whiff of antifreeze I kept smelling for a while but (so far) has not reappeared.

Yet, in the face of all these bad signs, I continue to love my homely little Jeep. I suppose I really have no choice, because a Hummer is too big (and expensive) and nothing else will do the job. "It's a Jeep thing; you wouldn't understand."

BUT I do own a wonderful, reliable 2WD Toyota pickup truck also. If I could only have 1 vehicle, I'm not sure it'd be a Wrangler.
