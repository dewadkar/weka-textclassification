            I got my 2000 Civic EX at the beginning of November and it's the first car I've owned myself.  I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a small car, especially in a city.  This is a great first car, it has great handling and good design and gets amazing mileage.  It's easy to drive and the interior features enhance the driving experience, especially for short people (like me) who are used to driving cars that are uncomfortable to drive because it's hard to reach things, etc.  The drive is very comfortable, even on badly kept roads.  The stock stereo system is clear and has very crisp sound, and the stereo has tons of features including a clock, cd player several radio settings and a full option cd player.  I live in a city and appreciate a compact car when it comes to looking for parking spaces.  I have taken the car on one long trip so far (about a 200 mile weekend trip, there and back) and it proved comfortable for all the passengers and got fantastic mileage.  The car is a commuter car, weekend car, and just about everything car for my one-person household but I still put it through a lot every week.  I couldn't imagine having to cart around crowds in it but for one person who is usually on their own it's a great choice.  

I can't say enough about this car.  It came with every option I wanted (and many more I didn't want but are nice to have) including anti lock brakes, an alarm, keyless entry, and a cd player.  I haven't had it very long but have already become a fan over this short time and recommend it highly.<br><br>
