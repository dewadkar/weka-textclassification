            I drive a 1985 Chevy Silverado with over 150K mile at work and boy do we WORK!  She and I work at one of the nation's largest Habitat for Humanity affiliates and we do it all:  from hauling lumber (I've stuffed 250 studs in her), to tons of sand, dirt, block, brick or rock.  Habitat sells its houses to the working poor for no profit (we don't even charge interest) so we HAVE to do it all.
The truck, as she is called because she's the only full-sized truck we have, handles it all.  I tow the Bobcat everywhere--I've even towed it with a ton of top soil on board.  She doesn't look pretty but she's got it where it counts!
This truck is highly reliable.  We build on multiple sites throughout a city of 250,000 so I must have the capability to get places.  She hasn't let me down yet so I know I'll keep her.<br><br>
