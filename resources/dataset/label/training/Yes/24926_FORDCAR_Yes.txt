            Just imagine yourself driving a brand new '99 Ford Mustang GT down the highway, with the power of the 4.6 litre V8 under your control. This is a chick magnet you say, after all look at the girl sitting in the passenger seat! But, all of a sudden a Camaro Z28 passes you and you can't seem to catch up. The 1999s are great believe me, but the &quot;muscle car&quot; is slowly vanishing from the original pony car. The new ponies are great cars for looks, even though many have criticized them, but my personal liking is more for the Fox body Mustangs, as opposed to the SN-95s. Sure, the new Mustangs might be a smoother ride, but is the smooth ride really a part o a muscle car? And look how high it sits...there is about 3 1/2 inches between the tire and the wheel well! But overall it's improved much over the previous SN-95s, but still not comparable to the Fox (mid '80s-93 models). I'd take it, I love Mustangs, but if I had a choice between a clean Fox with low mileage and the '99, the Fox would win without a second thought.<br><br>
