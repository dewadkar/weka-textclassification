            I bought this camera because I am sick of spending $50 - $60 to get film developed, and half the time the pictures either don't come out right or I just don't want them at all.  Now I have options!  If I take a pic I don't like, I just erase it on the camera screen and move on.  The resolution is excellent.  There are higher ones available, but for home use and lots of pictures, it's just fine.  In addition, if you buy a $150.00 Lexmark Z52 with 2000dpi resolution, you get almost photo quality prints.  Which brings me to the last point.  You ask, what about kodak photo quality prints?  The answer... you have options.  

You can take the SmartMedia card to a photolab that has processing capabilities for these type pictures and can get photo quality prints.  Or, you can burn the images onto a CD, take the CD to one of those Kodak photo kiosks you've seen in department/grocery stores and print a photo quality print, up to an 8x10&quot;.  This is great.  I am going to make Christmas cards using the new printer and digital photos.

The camera should pay for itself in about a year since I won't have to pay for film processing I don't really need.<br><br>
