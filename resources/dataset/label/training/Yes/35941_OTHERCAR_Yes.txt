            I recently traded in my beloved 1995 G20 for a 2000 Maxima. Much as I would have liked another G20, its only real downside was its size - a bit too small for my needs.

I paid $20,000 new and the new 2000 models are only a bit more. It's a lot of performance and reliability for the money.

THE GOOD:

In 4 1/2 years and 77,000 miles I needed only the following maintenance and service:

&gt;Replaced the tires
&gt;Replaced the brake pads
&gt;Replaced a faulty odometer
&gt;Oil changes every 3,000 miles (Easy to do yourself)
&gt;Replaced the wiper blades
&gt;Flushed the radiator

That's it!! Reliability is the strong point. While the 2.0 litre engine has been criticized as underpowered I loved it. It zipped me up to 80 MPH in a flash and felt as if the suspension was on rails - VERY smooth! You can take a corner at 35 - 40 MPH with nary a complaint from the Toyo high performance tires.

The 120 watt CD sound system was excellent and tailored quite nicely for the acoustics of the car. 

The trunk always blew people away by its size. It has to be equal or bigger than the trunk in the Maxima.

The heating system and heated sideview mirror worked flawlessly.

Great handling in snow and on slippery roads.

24 - 26 MPG on regular gas.

GREAT personalized dealer service.

Free Infinity loaner cars with all service appointments.

               .............................

THE NOT SO GOOD:

The engine could use a little more torque at the low end to get you off the mark quicker. A standard transmission is a better choice for this car.

The air conditioning was my biggest complaint. I was sure it wasn't working properly but it's simply underpowered. Unless I had it on high with the fan blowing right on me I would be sweating. The dealer replaced just about everything to no avail.

The reclining seats have a difficult to use knob instead of an easier to use lever.

Why would they put in a CD player and not a cassette player too?

The back seats are cramped as you might expect of a car this size.

The beige cloth seats dirtied easily and nothing could clean them.

                ..........................

The negatives were outweighed by the positives. I've never been happy with EVERYTHING about a car. The G20 came closest though and is my favorite car. I wish my new Maxima had the rail like handling of the G20.

If you're in the market for a compact size and want to experience an entry level luxury car consider the G20.
