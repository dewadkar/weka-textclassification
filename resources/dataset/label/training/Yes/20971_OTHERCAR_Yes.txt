            We bought the Suburban used with 5,000 miles on the odometer. Now 10 years and 183,000 miles later, we wonder if we will ever have to part with it. It has become a member of the family.

It has required very, very little maintenance.  To date, one starter, two universal joints in the driveshaft and a set of shocks.  The paint is still as good as it was when purchased. I have never had the front end aligned and still average 50 to 60,000 miles on a set of tires.  Gas mileage ranges from 10 mpg pulling a 24' travel trailer to 18 mpg on the Interstate.  The 350 CI V-8 uses NO oil whatsoever. 

If you are looking for a people, dogs, band equipment, garden supplies, etc. mover/hauler, this is it. We would certainly buy another Suburban if this one would only die!

The Suburban just rolled over 222,222 miles on the way back from Aspen, about 3,000 miles round trip. It still uses NO oil and the mpg has not changed. I bought two new front tires and thought I would have the alignment checked for the first time, ever. Dismay! Worn ball joints and tie rod ends. Not dangerously so, but will need to be replaced in the future.  The paint is coming off the hood and the clear coat off the roof. I'm not tall enough to see the top so I'm not sweating that. 

Still no reason to sell it!

1/1/03 - 243,000 miles and still going strong!

9/19/03 - 1/4 of a million miles - still going!
