            I recently bought a 1999 Plymouth Breeze.    What a joyous driving experience.   I have had other cars in the past but none handles on both city and highway conditions as well as my Breeze.   I'm not a mechanic therefore I won't review my car in technical terms.   I can only write about my experiences with the car.

This car has the interior room of a family car.   My husband is a large man and he enjoys driving this car even on long trips of several hours.   I feel this car is going to last a long time, at least I hope so.   I previously owned a smaller car with front wheel drive and you could always feel it pulling you around the corner.   Not the breeze.   I had to read the manual to see if it was front or rear wheel drive.

I also like the viewing radius or the car.   I don't have any problems seeing all around me when parking or backing up.   This was very important to me when selecting a new car.   The gas mileage is as advertised.   I get 24 mpg city and 32 mpg highway (even more on longer highway trips where refilling the car is necessary).

I was very sad to hear that Plymouth would not be manufacturing cars any more.   They really ended on a high note with the Breeze.   I did have one problem with the transmission but it was handled by my service representative promptly.<br><br>
