            To tell you the truth when I first saw the New Beetle I laughed.  I said to myself who would buy a car that is that cute. Come on, it looks like a toy.  A couple weeks later I met my new girlfriend... guess what she drove... yea, a yellow one too.  So at first I was skeptical.  She lives far from me so I thought to myself.. no one is gonna see me in it, sure I will ride in it.  I was sold.  From the outside it might look like Mattel made it but from the drivers seat(if you ignore the plastic vase thing)its a great... actually really sporty car.  It drives very nicely, the suspension is taut and the acceleration is perfectly adequate(if you need to race from stoplights go get a turbo one).  The interior is well laid out once you get used to it.  The color of that gauges at night is a cool touch.  The stereos buttons are small but its performance is great.  Overall for the money its a great deal.  It drives like a more expensive car(probably due to some help from the Audi parts bin)  The seating in her leather model is comfortable.. a bit hard for long trips.  This car isnt really a highway car.  It works fine there but the engine buzzes and the suspensions hardness gets a bit old on PA roads.  The interior space is great and there is enough storage cubbys.  All the plastic pieces are  a bit rough but are well placed and dont look like will rattle or come loose for years to come.  As for safety... I know its a small car but you cant beat it.  My girlfriend was driving home one day buzzing along as she always does when someone decided not to stop at a stop sign.  Well she slammed the brakes on and plowed right into the side of the explorer.  40 mph hit on the front end.  She got out with a minor bruise took one look at her new car and started crying (she couldnt stand to see the site of her cute little car with its face smashed in) Well a couple of thousand dollars later she was back in her car buzzing along.  I like almost everything about this car until I get out of it.  Its styling is CUTE.  I cant say much more.  Not my style but my girlfriend looks great in it.  She loves the looks along with millions of other people.  So if you are looking for an economy type car but dont want to drive something as stylish as the box the beetle was shipped in, I recommend the New Beetle.
Do me a favor get a silver one ;]  (also get the new larger wheel option, they look pretty sweet)<br><br>
