            First the car is great 
Second it is beautiful 
and Third it is comfortable
This opinion is not a &quot;oh it is a perfect car&quot; one ,it is the raw truth i have owned my 1994 es 300 for 3 years and enjoyed it . If you are looking at buying one you will enjoy it . 
Here are the points that are to be looked at 
1. The key(s) if lost cost around $800 to replace as lexus has to give you a new brain for the alarm and 2 new keys the old one ( that you might still have ) will not work at the same frequency.
2. The headlights can get moisture in them cost to replace around $1000 for a new one.
3 . The dash lights can burn out and are around $150 to replace all of them. The worst dash problem is the needles . The needles have a tendency to stark flickering and they cost about $ 700 to replace , as you will need a new instrument cluster ( at least you get new bulbs ).
4. The engine only takes premium , another opinion post says it doesn't but it does belive me .
5. The doors have no frames and as such can be pushed out of alignment by people closing the doors by the window this can cause some wind noise at highway speeds but can be realigned easily .
6. Performance wise there is not a lot on the market for this car just a front strut bar and lowering springs . I was able to get a custom cold air intake built but that is all . The car does a great job of moving at highway speeds and any other high rpm situation but off the line at a light it has slow pick up until about 3500 rpm then it blasts off .
7. The seat are a little short they don't go very far forward ( as in reaching behind your knees )so it takes a bit to get used to .
8. The 1994 model looks exactly the same as a 1992 and 1993 ES 300 the differences are the 94 recieved dual ( passenger airbags ) also an ambient temperature sensor ( outside temp ) and has a few changes to the engine like coils that are mounted on top of the plugs . The 1992 model can be had with a 5-speed manual if so desired also but is no longer offered . The 1995-1996 model has an even better engine especially for fuel economy t has a VVT system which is a variable camshaft ( like honda's v-tech ). It gives better performance and mileage . These models also have different rear lights and front ones which have lines across them and square white fog lights as the years before have yellow round projection ones          ( 1992-1994 ) . Most and all maintenance can be done at a toyota dealership but just remember the lexus dealer gives you the car wash and other perks but you pay for it .
9. This may sound negative but it is the truth not some junk for you to read . I feel this will give you all the information to look at when wanting to buy this car . The car is trouble free however , i have never had to have any thing other than routine maintenance ( which is rare for any car ). The car will last as long as you want it to by looking after it . It really is a quiet automobile but that is a mark of a lexus . If it is in your budget get the 1995 model , better engine as i mentioned before but otherwise the 1994  is the way to go  will last much longer than previous models as to engine refinements .
One thing that makes the car so quiet and vibration less is that it has a liquid engine mount .
The only options were a cd changer a sunroof and leather seats in Canada the car also came with a cold weather kit which was heated leather seats and headlight washers .<br><br>
