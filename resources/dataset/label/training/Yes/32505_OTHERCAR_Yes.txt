            <b>DRIVE TIME:  </b>
For 17 days in June �02, I had the pleasure of driving the 2002 Audi A4 1.8-T with the manual 5-speed transmission while working in Europe.  Mine was in the �Dolphin Grey Pearl� color, although it resembled a dark gray metallic.  Very pretty little car.  Although I don�t know why I say �little�.  There�s nothing about this car that is little, from interior space to trunk room to performance.  Although driving on unfamiliar roads, the car was never a problem.  My normal car is a 1999 Lexus LS-400, and I thoroughly enjoyed this step back into a �real� car again where I could feel the road and actually control the shifting of the gears.  Now I know I have been �asleep at the wheel� for the last 3 years driving my Lexus, and there was still some fun left to be had while driving!  

<b> PRICE COMPARISON:  </b>
Although I have previously owned a BMW 540 and a BMW 325i in the last 10 years, I think the Audi A4 has the BMW�s features and at a much more reasonable sticker (MSRP $24,900 for the A4, $29,200 on the lowest-priced BMW 325 ci, up to $31,250 for the 325 xiT) there are more reasons to go for the Audi.  IMHO, you would have a hard time comparing the features on the A4 to the BMW.  The A4 would win, hands down, and you�re already $5,000 ahead.  My BMW days are over, as I am convinced after trips to the shop that those letters don�t stand for Bavarian Motor Works, they are an acronym for �Break My Wallet�.  

<b>FEATURE COMPARISON:</b>
<i>Responsiveness:</i>  That rousing little 170hp turbo-charged 6-cylinder engine is a real go-getter.  Getting up to speed on those European highways at 100 to 120 kilometers is no problem for this car, even while carrying 4 adults and their luggage in the extra-roomy trunk.  Get up and go!  
<i>Interior room: </i> Headroom was no problem for my colleagues, one standing at 5ft-8, one at 5ft-10 and another at 6ft-2.  I am a short person at 5ft-2, but several of us drove the car with equal ease.  Front and back seat both had great head and leg room.  
<i>Trunk/luggage: </i> Having recently rented a 2000 Audi A6, the trunk room in this model was actually larger!  (Also, who knew they were still putting full size spare tires in the trunk?)
<i>Trip/Driver Information: </i> This car has the same info available as my Lexus:  timer, miles to empty, average mpg, average and instant kph/mph, clock, outside temp.  All located in good view for both the driver and passengers.
<i>Stereo/CD system: </i>The Audi �symphony� stereo system  comes standard on this model.  The one I had was equipped with an in-dash 6-CD player, too. The only complaint that I have about the stereo would be that it�s placed too low on dash and has teeny-tiny buttons. Changing or locating stations or trying to scan through your CD while driving in traffic could be hazardous to your health!  This is offset, however, by the -"Autostore" function which automatically selects the six strongest FM and AM stations in the area (great while in Europe!).
<i>Optional Sunroof: </i> Didn�t get one on this model, have one on my Lexus and use it about once a year (live in Oregon)....I know they add noise, and I thought the noise level overall was average (it wasn�t as quiet as my Lexus, but not as noisy as my daughter�s Mercury Cougar).

<b>BOTTOM LINE:</b>
I want one!  My husband owned an Audi A5000 back in the 80�s.  We liked Audi�s then for their looks and performance.  I think when we go car shopping again, I�ll seriously consider any model of Audi, it will be an obviously quality vehicle with German craftsmanship at a reasonable price, and I can have FUN again behind the wheel!
