            In October 2000, I bought a silver TT 225 Quattro Coupe straight off the dealer's lot in Palo Alto.  There have been loads of stories about 6-month wait lists, but sometimes you just have to believe in luck!  

This car is probably the most fun you can have on 4 wheels, and with a little tweaking (a $500 ECU chip upgrade), outperforms almost anything out there, especially on twisty roads.  I regularly drive Highway 17 over the Santa Cruz Mountains in Northern California, and have discovered with the TT that there's no need to brake for corners.  It's just glued to the road, even in the wet, where the Quattro four wheel drive, 6-speed box and ESP (Electronic Stability Program) keep you from coming to grief, unless you're being really silly.

I've owned several Maserati Biturbos, so am accustomed to turbo lag on acceleration.  As long as you keep the revs up, this is not an issue.  Just don't try to pull away from the lights at 800 RPM, as it will take an age for the turbo to spool up, and you'll be passed by almost anything.  However, replacing the chip produces a lot of extra low-end torque, so this weakness becomes academic.  Good aftermarket chips are by MTM, Garrett, APR and others.  There's a very lively TT discussion group on the www.audiworld.com site, and the members freely share a load of bright ideas and experiences with their cars.

Now some comments on the TT.  If you can afford it, get the Quattro and 225hp variant.  The 4-wheel drive and extra power are essential.  Go for a leather interior and the Premium package which gives you superb Xenon headlights and the most excellent heated seats, even if you live in California.  

As for looks, the car is a real head-turner, inside and out.  There are many more on the road now than there used to be, particularly in the Bay Area, but it still gathers stares and questions, not to mention a lot of envy!  People either love it (in my experience 95%) or hate it (5%).  The interior is a driver's delight, all controls logically to hand, and an excellent driving position if you're under 6' 5&quot;.  The rear seat is for children only, although it makes for a good shelf.  Fold the rear seats down and the hatchback gives you a surprisingly large luggage tray, certainly enough for two people for a week.  You quickly get used to the limited visibility, although there are substantial blind spots at the rear quarters, which make parallel parking interesting.  The car's so short, and the turning circle so tight, that you'll get it into the smallest spaces easily.

To sum up: if you love driving, and appreciate fine German engineering, the TT is for you.  Just be prepared for the wait, and start grinning.
