            Ever since I was a little boy I have been told to buy American when it comes to cars. &quot;Son, it's good to buy American cars, you gotta help your own!&quot; My parents have always bought American. As long as I can remember we've owned something like 1 Buick, 1 Chevy, 1 Mercury, 2 Chryslers and 3 Fords. So when it came time for me to get my first car ever it was no surprise that I was looking only at American cars.

But everything in my price range was boring and unimaginative. They all looked the same. The Pontiac Sunfire looked like a cheap toy. The Mercury Cougar looked like a typical American sports car. I was feeling a little bummed. Then one day my friend who sells Volkswagens said &quot;Hey dude, why don't you get a Golf?&quot;

Revelation. Epiphany. The very first car I had ever fallen in love with was the Volkswagen Rabbit. For those of you who don't know the Rabbit is the ancestor of the Golf. How wonderful! As soon as I started looking at the Golf I fell in love again. The hatchback appeals to the side of me that still thinks it would be fun to slap on an oil slick and a smokescreen and become a courier and dust vigilantes just like in Autoduel. The fact that the GLS, the Golf I was looking at, has 4 doors when a hatchback should only have 2 doors makes me silly.

So after falling instantly in love I became fixated. Two weeks ago I bought my Golf GLS and I have to say it is living up to all of the expectations I have put on it. I have the luxury package (sun-roof, power controls and alloy wheels), the Monsoon sound system (I guess it's better than the regular one) and the 6-CD changer. I love to go driving by the ocean with the windows and sunroof open digging the scenery. And when it's time to come home and park in the city (San Francisco) I can fit into the tight places that other people with their large American boats cannot. 

With the Golf's natural good looks and added luxury features I feel like a fancy blue-collared man. I go places in style in my hatchback and I don't care that everyone these days who buys a Volkswagen is getting a Jetta or that new bubbly Beetle. I'm a rogue and with my new Golf I can go where I please.
