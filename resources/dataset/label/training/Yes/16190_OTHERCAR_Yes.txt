            After testing the Dodge, Ford, and Chevy (no Hondas were available), We went with the Sienna LE.  My wife thought the ford was cheaply made, the salesman for the Dodge was too aggressive and the Chevy Dealer insisted we needed a VCR when we repeatedly said we didn't want it.  We tried to buy from the Boise, ID dealer but after three delays, purchased from Downtown Toyota in Spokane, WA where we were also minorly jerked around.  
The sienna is very comfortable to drive, the stereo is also pretty good.  I liked the double doors and the second row Captains Chairs.  It corners pretty well for a minivan and has good acceleration.
I don't like its performance on hills.  If you are in cruise control it continually jerks in and out of gear to maintain speed and rapidly accelerates and decelerates unless you take it out of overdrive.  the manual states this but I did not have similar problems with other models tested.  Also do not get anywhere near the 24-28 mpg on the highway.  It is closer to 20 mpg.
Great for Families or anyone needing extra room.
Not great for anyone else<br><br>
