            While this review is about the Porsche Boxster, there will be some comparisons to the BMW Z-3 and other autos in this category group. I was fortunate enough to own a Porsche Boxster at the same time my wife owned the BMW Z-3. So we were able to do a great side-by-side comparison. 

For those of you who have never owned or driven a Porsche, there is really nothing like it on this planet. So far, I�ve owned seven Porsches ranging from the 911 to the 930 and now the Boxster. From a handling and performance perspective, they can�t be beat, unless you are willing to pay twice the money to get a Ferrari or maybe a Lamborghini.  From a comfort and family perspective, they are pretty much a zero. The newer 996s (1999 and above) have added more creature comforts but the price tag now exceeds $80,000 and most people�s budget.

As for the Boxster, it has most of the superb handling capabilities of the 911 and certainly all of it�s good looks. For a two seater, it is quite roomy. I�m pretty big (that�s wide not tall) and I fit into the cockpit with ease. Porsche�s are not made for tall folks, however, 6� is about the limit. A friend of mine, 6� 4� tried to drive one of my 911s and it was quite a miserable experience. The interior grouping is quite well thought out. The instruments are aligned perfectly for finding anything in an instant. The leather interiors are much softer and more luxurious than the older 911s (same as the newer 996s). The problem with the seats, however, is the lack of lumbar support and the inability to position the seat to fit the individual. After about 20 miles, I get a lower back ache. I checked with the dealer, and they don�t offer any upgraded seats for my model year. They do for the newer ones and I strongly recommend you purchase the upgraded seat package, if and when available. I had to put a small pillow behind my lower back to enable me to drive the car for any long distance.

As I mentioned at the top, the handling is the thing with Porsches. The Boxster is no exception. It is sure-footed in the corners and tight situations. You feel like you command the road instead of being at it�s mercy. Same for every Porsche I�ve ever been in! That�s what they do best.  For comparison, the BMW Z-3 handles pretty well, but when you get into a tight squeeze, or just want to push it toward the edge, the BMW falls short. You don�t get that secure feeling that it�s going to protect you if you push a little too far. The Boxster does. I won�t say it handles as well as the 911s but it pretty darn close.

Performance is a different issue. The normally-inspired 200 hp model I bought has good pickup, and in comparison to the Z-3 (2.8 V6), it eats its lunch. But it does not have the 911s sense of total power and performance.  Its got a real good second gear, and again compared to the Z-3 the gearing is much better. You will spend all day changing gears on the Z-3 but not on the Boxster. The range for each gear is quite adequate, it�s just the raw power that�s lacking. While I haven�t driven one yet, I�m certain the Boxster �S� cures the power problem. It has 250 hp and a six-speed gear-box  (I have gear-box envy). So if power and performance are high on your list of priorities, consider the Boxster �S�.

Good looks are certainly in the eye of the beholder. However, in evaluating the Z-3, M-B SLK and the Boxster, for me the hands-down winner in the looks department is the Boxster. Now my wife disagrees, she likes her Z-3 better. So maybe it�s a man vs. woman perspective. The Boxster is a bit more masculine than the Z-3 and that might account for the preference (seems to me like a lot more women drive Z-3s and a lot more men drive Boxster but I have not done a scientific survey or anything).  I think the SLK looks great with it�s integrated �hard� top, but overall I think the SLK is a little too square (boxy?) for a true sports car and it performs the lowest in the group.

Integrity is a subjective qualifier. Some people think that if it doesn�t rattle or break down often, it has integrity. I feel that integrity is in the overall package, it goes to the heart of the car making experience. Traditionally, Porsches have been built (crafted?) almost by hand, verses the assembly line thing. With the Boxster (I understand), they came up with some assembly innovations that allowed them to mass produce the car, keep the price down, but still retain the integrity that comes from a hand-built automobile. I think they succeed totally. 

The integrity of the Boxster is up to 911 standards. Tight, solid, and nothing even smells of cheap plastic. A 10! On the other hand, my Z-3 rates only a 5 in this category. Things keep falling off of it and I hate it when that happens. With convertibles, it�s always the integration of the convertible top with the rest of the auto that determines the success or failure of the overall design. The Porsche Boxster again gets a 10. Not only is it great fun to watch the top slide into the trunk, but when the top is in place, it is quiet, windless, leak-proof, and seamlessly beautiful. The top was not an afterthought of the design (okay guys, lets cut the tops off a couple hundred of those sedans and we�ll call �em cabriolets) but an integral part of it. The Z-3s top is fine, but there is a little bit of wind noise at speeds over 70 mph. Additionally, with the top down, the Boxster is much quieter at high speeds than the Z-3. We already mentioned the SLKs top. That�s a great design, as well, maybe the best in the bunch. But with the top up, it doesn�t look as cool as the Boxster or the Z-3, in my opinion.

Let�s talk price. As with any car buy, know the dealer, and know about the car before you buy it. I�m not talking the 10-minute test drive here, I�m talking research. The list price on the Boxster is around $50,000 and that�s worth a few hours to a few days of research. Make sure this really is what you want in a car! If your other vehicle is an SUV, Van or station-wagon, the Boxster may be a good choice. Look for a good deal! Don�t buy into the myth that people with money don�t look for deals. That�s how they got a lot of their money � but not giving it away to the sleazy car dealers. Look at used Boxsters. I say �used� mainly because Porsches, inherently, are driven a lot less and taken care of a lot more than the average family vehicle. They are almost all �garage� kept, and maintain current service records. It is not at all uncommon to find a two year old Porsche with under 10K miles on it. In fact, I bought my Boxster when it was 20 months old and it only had 3,000 miles on it (that was not a type-o, yes 3k). You can save up to $10 grand buying used vs. new.

With any performance car (this is especially true with the more expensive higher-performance 911s and 996s), the warranty is important. If you buy used, get the extended warranty! Also, I would not recommend buying any Porsche with high mileage. High performance engines just don�t last as long, and an overhaul of a Porsche (911) engine could cost well over $10,000 (trust me, I know). The Boxster engine is an all-new design, which should hold up a lot longer, and operate more service-free, than the older 911s. Actually, the new 996 uses the �Boxer� engine design to replace the traditional air-cooler engines that have been a Porsche staple since the very beginning.

Obviously, I recommend this car IF you are looking for a sports car that feels like one and drives like one and handles like one. If you are after brute power, look for a big-engine Mustang or move up to the 996 (if you�ve got $80k).
