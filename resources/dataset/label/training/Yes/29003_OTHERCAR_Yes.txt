            I'll start with the engine, which everybody seems to agree on. There needs to be more power. This bothers my husband more than me, but I get irritated trying to use cruise control. My state is fairly hilly, and the car sounds like it's straining going up these hills.  And the hills aren't that big!  

But the vehicle is perfect for my needs. I have 2 small kids and this vehicle is practical. There's lots of room for strollers, luggage, groceries, even bikes.  I have the LX model, which, for not much more gives me the leather seats, tinted back windows, CD and cassette player, car mats, etc.  The only thing I didn't like with the LX was the color choice. I wanted either black or white, and the only colors available in the LX are green, gold and silver. 

I like the interior design of the car...it's a comfortable ride.  Seats adjust well, and I like all the room in the front.  Backseat is fine for kids.  There are plenty of cupholders and a neat armrest for the driver seat. Stereo could be better, but it'll do.  

This is my first Honda, and so far, I'm impressed. I expect this vehicle to last a long time.  I bought the extra service package, which provides free maintenance, a few free oil changes and a car care kit. It also includes road service and rental.  I was told if someone spills anything on my seats (if not leather) or carpet that can't be cleaned up, they'll replace it completely. This is great to have with kids!  

One more note...this is a great vehicle, but I recommend it more for women, simply because it's a smaller, easier to handle SUV, it's safer (low turnover rate), and most men probably wouldn't like the lack of power.  I wouldn't recommend this vehicle for towing anything. Don't get me wrong...my husband likes it too!  But he does complain about the engine.
