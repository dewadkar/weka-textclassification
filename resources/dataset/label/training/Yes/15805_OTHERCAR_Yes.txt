            Both of these cars are outstanding, but I would have to say that a Solara is like a dream car to me.  The Toyota Solara 99' is shaped like a sports car but made for a family.  It's a model up to the camry and has the same engine as a Lexus.  The price of the Solara is reasonable for it's type of car, it can be compared to a lower model Lexus.  The engine is as quite as a mouse, when you start up the car sometimes you'll wonder if it's even running.  The way this car sticks to the road will take your breath away.  It's traction is like glue and can hug turns like anything.  Also, this car can accelerate from 0-100 km in about 7 seconds.  

For those who are into music this car is equipped with 6 JBL speakers and has a build in CD player and cassette.  It has all your standard features, like power window, door lock, power steering.  Also if you upgraded it you can a marble inside with a sunroof.  The inside is so cosy that you can fall asleep in there easily, there is enough leg room in the back and front for almost any type of person.  

The only downfalls about this car is that it has two doors which gives it a sporty look, however it's not a typical type of sports car because it has a long sleek body meant for a family.  If you're into sports car look at the Toyota Celica.  However, if you want a car that will take your breath away this is the one, the price is very reasonable and the performance of this car is beyond words.  Just take a test drive in one of these and you'll see for yourself.  <br><br>
