            I have had my 1990 Bronco II for over 3 years now and still love it.  I've driven my truck to Alaska from Wisconsin twice and now I live in Fairbanks Alaska.  It is tons of fun to drive in the deep snow at 40 below.  Don't listen to the hype about Bronco II's being tippy.  I take corners like do with any car.  Most everything I have to say about the Bronco II is good.  There are a few minor things that some other comparable SUVs have to offer.

There are many things to consider before buying a Bronco II.  One of which is whether or not you have small childeren or if you will have elderly passengers. Access to the back seat can be difficult.  It is almost impossible to get in the back from the driver's side.  My mother (who is 50 years young) has trouble getting in the back seat from the passenger seat.  It would be troublesome to put a child seat in the back as well.

There is one other flaw with the Bronco II.  The rear door which swings up from the bottom makes it difficult to carry long cargo.  Because the spare tire mount swings out, you cannot tie down the door. 

Here is a list of maintenance that I've had to deal with my Bronco II.  I've had to replace my automatic hubs with manuals, becouse the automatic ones just could not take any abuse.  The throwout barring in the transmission started making a racket so I had to have some barrings replaced.  Other than tune ups and toys that is all I've had to do to my favorite truck.
