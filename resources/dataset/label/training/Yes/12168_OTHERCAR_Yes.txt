            First impressions? Incredibly solid construction - no squeaky plastic here. The camera is smaller than a pack of cigarettes and fits easily into any pocket you may have on any item of clothing. It's a true "take anywhere" camera, though stuffing it in the same pocket as your car keys might not do it's beautiful exterior any favours.
Apparently, it's unusual for a camera "in this class" to carry a focus assist lamp - a bright light that shines in low light. Well, the QV-R3 has one, but it's a bore to use, as it is so slow that whatever you wanted to photograph has been and gone and died before the lamp has done its stuff. I don't know how it is with more expensive digi-cameras ( I am accustomed to manual film cameras, so anything digital seems a little slow) but this lamp is well worth deactivating.
This brings me to the beef of my commentary. What I love about this camera is that there are options for toying with the settings; taking control of your photo is easy to do, and, if you want, you can have almost instantaneous shutter-action by setting the exposure and focus in advance. Doing manual focus takes a bit of guestimation, to say the least, but you can get really good results.
I love this camera...  I have had it for about a month, and I keep on finding cool new features. If I'd taken this many pictures on film, I'd be bankrupt. With the QV-R3, I can take as many pictures as I like, and get great results, without necessarily knowing what I'm doing, and without breaking the bank.
BUY IT FOR YOUR LOVED ONE! They will want it!
Regarding shutter lag - if you have preset focus manually, and set the exposure, and deactivated the flash....  you have no shutter lag. So I give this thumbs up in that department.
