            I recently bought a Subaru Impreza. I choose the sedan TS version. Why a Subaru? The all wheel drive of course. 
Living in Canada, and having to go to work even when snowstorm are hitting us, I felt I would be much safer driving an all wheel drive. There is a wide range of 4wd in the SUVs category but if you are looking for a car... your options are limited. 
Since I couldn't afford a Audi, I turned to Subaru. I never regretted my choice. The Impreza is the cheapest car in the Subaru family. This car will bring you pure driving pleasure. 
Unfortunately winter was over when I bought the car so I haven't had the chance to experience how the car would handle in the snow or on icy road. I must say however, that until now whatever the road conditions were (wet or dry) the car always stick to the road even when you take curves a little fast. 
Basic line for me is that I feel safe while driving this car. It can seem a little expensive when you compare with similar equipped compact car, but I think the awd is worth every extra cents. 
About the equipment, a lot of features are standard, such as air conditioning, electric windows and locks, and cassette player. There is also a lot of useful features such as cup holders, three storages boxes and a coin holder. I also think this car is quite stylish with its rear spoiler as well as its fog lights.  One negative aspect would be that there is no pass-through trunk. 

All that said, I would recommend the Impreza without hesitation.
