            I have a suspicion that 20 years hence, the 93-95 models of this car will be regarded as classic. The styling is dramatic and was actually well ahead of its time. Silly Lexus abandoned this style and Mercedes lifted it, slightly tweaked it, and voila! Mercedes had the dramatic new S-series while the Lexus LS for all its manifest virtue was left looking pretty dowdy.

It is fun to drive while retaining all the normal Lexus virtues -- quiet, super reliable, and elegant. The in-line 6 engine is reputed to be the most reliable of the Lexus line and, for what it's worth, I have had no trouble with the engine (or much of anything else for that matter -- see below). As a note, we also have a 95 LS -- nothing else comes close for quiet including the GS. However, if one doesn't have an LS to compare it to, the GS seems the quietest car ever made.

This car has significantly more passenger room than its comparables: the Mercedes E-class and the BMW 5-series. The trunk is smaller than the Mercedes but equal to the BMW. However, it is high rather than deep and thus takes a little "getting used to."

My only objection to Lexus is their dealers, though in fairness they are no worse and maybe even slightly better than the average dealer. One does get a "free" loaner which of course one pays for in the service rates, which are HIGH. Be aware that the dealers make their money on service and, to a lesser extent, used cars. New car sales are no better than break-even operations. So, you get nice facilities, lounges, "free" coffee, drinks, and snacks, and "free" loaners with really high bills and needless work. Moreover, I suspect but cannot prove that inept work caused a serious problem with the car's front brakes which would have cost close to $3,000 to fix at the dealer. Fortunately, I found a very good independent mechanic who still had to charge me close to $1,000 to fix the problem (which required replacing both brake lines from the master cylinder, all the pads, and one rotor).

So, it's a wonderful car, will easily go 200,000 plus miles but to keep the costs of ownership down it is best to find a GOOD independent service facility -- but then that's true of all cars.
