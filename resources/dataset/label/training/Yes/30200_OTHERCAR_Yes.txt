            My wife and I ordered our 1992 Dodge Caravan because of two kids and besides we needed the room.The only thing about our Caravan that we did not lile was that it took so long to get the rear door latch replaced when they had a recall.It is now the year 2000 and we have 79,995 miles on the van and all I have had to do to the van is the normal oil changes,new brake pads,spark plugs,and I did have the roters turned.I still love the van and have never had any trouble with it. I have the 3.0 engine and the three speed automatic lock up transmission.I would still recomend this van to anyone who has kids or anyone who just wants the extra room and comfort.<br><br>
