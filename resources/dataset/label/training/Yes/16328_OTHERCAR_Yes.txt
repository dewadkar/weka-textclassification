            I purchased a Hewlett Packard PhotoSmart C200 in Dec '99 for $299 from Best Buy.  I was looking for a beginning digital camera that was of good quality, megapixel, and inexpensive.  $299 was more than I wanted to spend but I couldn't find anything that I liked in a lesser price range. This product is not top of the line but is rich in features. There are cameras with somewhat better resolution capabilities for about the same price.  A major purchase decision for me was an extra 16 mg memory card included as a promo (about a $60 value). It additionally came with an 8 mg card. 

The camera has a built in flash, red eye feature, auto-focus feature, and a time delay feature which enables the picture taker to get in the photo too!  The camera has a zoom feature. There is a selection for 3 different resolutions.  There is an LCD screen on back of the camera to view stored pictures.  It comes with video and serial cables.  There is a built in shutter door that is closed when not making pictures.  This is a good protection device for the lens.  

There is software that comes with the camera but my preference is edit them using MS Picture-It which came with my computer. The camera does not come with a case.  It does come with a carrying strap to attach to the camera. The instruction book is not the easiest to understand, it takes a little playing around with the camera to get familiar with it.   

I was most interested in sending internet pictures.  I am pleased with the jpgs I've sent in email and the pictures I've added to my webpage. The resolution is fine and my friends have commented on the good quality. 

I was also pleased and quite surprised at the photo prints I've made using my non photo quality inkjet printer on inkjet photo paper!  I thought I would need a photo quality printer but the prints have came out great!   

Many people complain of digital camera batteries draining quickly but that has not been a problem for me.  I am still using the AA batteries which came with the camera.  It does not come with an a/c adapter!  I do limit using the led picture viewer and turn the camera off when not making pictures.  I bought an accessory to download the pictures directly from the memory card to the computer, a SanDisk imagemate.  This eliminates the need to use the camera when transferring images to a pc. 
  
Although I bought this camera for personal use, I see no reason why it wouldn't be a good camera to use for business uses, perhaps to make product pictures for a website. This is a wonderful technology and a digital camera is a nice addition to my photo taking!
