            I have owned my 2001 Volkswagon Jetta for about 6 months.  I purchased it used from a non-VW used car dealer.  Big mistake - if you are going to buy VW buy from VW - they knew nothing about the car.  I owned it a month before I found the CD player in the back!  If the dealership had known about it they probably would have charged me for it though so that was not all bad.  I have read alot of people who say these cars are unreliable and also consumer reports.  Honestly, that has not been my experience.  The car always starts, the trim is solidly attached, the door handles are not flaking.  Nothing has broken on this car.  Top that off with the fact that it is stylish, impressive to ride in (all my friends love it) and very fun to drive and you have a really nice car.  It can be a little thirsty in stop start driving but it really shines on the highway.  I can start a 100 mile drive with less then half a tank and get to my destination with gas to spare.  The back seat is a little cramped but the headroom is wonderful.  Also, if you are driving and the sun is shining in your eyes it is easy to use the hand crank to raise the seats and get it out of your eyes (great for us short people)  The things I don't like:  I don't like the maintenance costs (although you are only changing the oil every 5000 miles so you do save a little there)  An oil change is around 40 dollars (it includes a tire rotation) and takes around 3 hours even with an appointment.  I would love it if the car were less thirsty in town.  The car is noisy - when I first got it I was constantly taking it to the dealership to have it checked.  They would check it and say that nothing was wrong.  I have just had to learn to live with a lot of little whirs and clicks, apparently that is just how VW's are.  I would like it if the upholstery was not so easily dirtied.  Because the air bags are in the front seats you cannot put a cover on them.  They do respond well to steam cleaning.
