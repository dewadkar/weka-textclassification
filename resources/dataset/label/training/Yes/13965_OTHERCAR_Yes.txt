            I am the proud owner of a black on black 2000 Toyota MR2 Spyder.  I traded my 1987 MR2 in on it.  I bought this car with 4000 miles on it, for $20,000 and got $1100 for my trade in.  

I had my old MR2 for 4 years and was very comfortable with the handling characteristics of a mid-engine car.  The new MR2 has the same characteristics, they are just enhanced.  

I have read countless articles with people complaining of the lack of cargo space, and there is no argument.  I bought this car primarily because I am a driving enthusiast.  I have no kids to cart around, and need only to buy enough groceries to feed myself.  

Driving is what this car is all about.  Driving, not practicality.  It handles like a dream, especially at the hands of an experienced mid-engine driver.  You are also part of an exclusive group when you become a Spyder owner, as there are only 5000 imported a year, so unlike the Miata, you won't see an MR2 Spyder on every block.

All in all, this car is fabulous, and I recommend it to anyone in the market for a fun car to drive, and contrary to common opinion, if you pack wisely, it is possible to get away for the weekend as long as you leave the 27&quot; television at home.

Buy one, and you'll agree with everything you just read.<br><br>
