            Amazing! I don't think that such a respected company as Chevrolet could produce such a poor car. The first and only time I drove this car was when my co-worker's car was in the shop and I had to use it to run some errands. First of all the car has the power of the go carts I used to race when I was a kid! Second of all the entire car was really cramped, myself not being extremely tall (5'7&quot;) had a hard time staying it the car for the fifteen minutes I was in there for. Another problem I had was the fact that the car would sputter and creak every so often, which is really bad for a car that isn't that old. The last and biggest problem was the use of such cheap parts. You can tell that many places on the car they used the cheapest materials that they could find. Please, anyone thinking of purchasing this car....Don't and you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.<br><br>
