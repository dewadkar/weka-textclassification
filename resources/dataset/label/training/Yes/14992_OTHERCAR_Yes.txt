            I have owned my Sony Mavica FD73 since November 99 and in general I am satisfied with it for what I intended to use it for.  I bought it for the main purpose of taking pictures for online auctions.  I had also hoped though to be able to use it for a general purpose camera and take pictures while on vacation.

The ease of using the camera is very good.  There are many options available to you for different lighting situations; different tones on the pictures including black and white; strong zoom lens and an extremely close macro feature.  I find it keeps the colors true, although some inside pictures tend to wash out with the flash.  If there is natural or lights available, I use the flash on a lower setting have found that helps eliminate the washed out look on close ups and skin tones.  The most convenient feature of the camera is the use of a floppy disk to store your pictures on.  You may process your pictures right off the disk into the camera, view them, edit them or send them off to your friends in an Email.

However, I tend to disagree with the other epinions about the camera.  I do not care for the 'viewfinder' system they use.  I find that you are not able to steady the camera and hold it real still, more so on scenery pictures.  I find that because of this the pictures do not always come out as clear and crisp as I would like (in comparison to a 35mm camera).

Another disadvantage of the camera is the battery power.  2.5 hours usage on the battery is not very good for taking on a trip.  You would need about 3 batteries to make it through a day trip. If you are always near an electrical outlet to recharge the battery, which basically takes about 1 hour, then one battery would suit you fine.  

As I said though my main purpose of the camera was for close up pictures and I find the camera is wonderful for that purpose.  I have taken pictures as close as 1&quot; and they have come out very crisp and clear.  

In general, I would determine what your main purpose of this camera is for before purchasing it.  The ease of use, the floppy disk to save pictures, the zoom and macro feature are well worth it.  I have owned a different digital camera prior to this, and although the Mavica now suits my purpose better, the older camera was much better for taking shots of scenery and general pictures.<br><br>
