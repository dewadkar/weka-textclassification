            With all of the positive opinions on the Corsica, I thought I'd mention how my 5 speed 2.2 liter 1990 Corsica gets mileage that is unmatched by any other vehicle its size.  On the open highway at 60 MPH, it's 38 to 40 MPG, and in mixed driving 32-34 MPG!  And that is in the Washington, DC area with some of the worst stop and go traffic you can find.  I highly recommend the Corsica for anyone needing economy and decent sedan size.

Now, other points.  I bought my Corsica new in January 1990.  Since then, after 191,000 miles this week, besides the normal oil and filters, I have had to only invest in one set of shocks, three sets of tires and one set of brakes for routine maintenance.  Non-routine maintenance has been very little: one alternator, one heater core, one fuel valve and one suspension part -- probably about $700 total over 10 years!  I have a Ford Taurus that has cost $400 to $700 for every, very frequent repair. Below I will mention one bad thing, a paint defect, but that was limited to a few years around 1990.

Afraid of a clutch?  Note that I have the original still with no sign of it giving in.  If you are lucky enough to find a used Corsica with a clutch, 5 speed, get it!  Learn and you will see that you can again have fun driving, and even that 2.2 liter engine off the line with a five speed can beat most of the newer cars time and time again.

Oh, I almost forgot.  One other reviewer mentioned crash protection.  My Corsica was hit from behind while I was stopped at a light.  Scratches to my bumper was the only damage, but the Honda Civic that hit me had its entire front end crumpled!

Now on the paint defect.  Be very careful about buying 1988 -- 1991 era Corsicas, and perhaps any GM car.  They often have pain peeling problems, which after 10 years should have developed if they were going to develop.  If you are unlucky enough to get one, you can get a very good paint job on the entire car for $800 -- $1000, don't fall for the $3000 story.  I had mine painted for $800 two years ago, a job that was as good as the new one, you couldn't tell.  I'm almost sold on repainting rather than waxing! It still shines and beads water with no wax since I had it painted.

Take care and enjoy your Corsica.<br><br>
