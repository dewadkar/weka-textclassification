            This is one of my favorite SUVs built to date.  I have been in as well as test driven numerous SUVs and I have found few that surpass the RX300.  The RX300 is built on the Toyota Camry platform, which gives the car a more sedan-like ride to it.  I myself have a Toyota 4Runner, which I love dearly, and the differences between the two are astonishing.  The Toyota 4Runner is pretty much like the typical midsize SUV and the RX300 is pretty much in the same class.  

I was able to test drive my aunts RX300 the other day and I loved it.  Though the RX300 and the 4Runner both run off of similar V6 engines(the Lexus one is better, of course), the RX300 will easily burn the 4Runner.  This is due not only to the engine but to a lighter overall weight.  The RX300 also corners better than the 4Runner.  I found that I was able to take turns at higher speeds and not feel like the car was about to tip over.  Another great thing about the RX300 is that it is must more gas efficient than other SUVs.  It is advertised to get about 17-19 in the city and about 22-25 on the highway.

Now that we have finished with the performance aspect of the car let's look at the interior and the styling.  The interior of the car is pretty much like most other Lexi(I think thats the plural for Lexus:) ) but with a few differnces.  On the center console there is what appears to be a GPS screen but in fact is just the central information unit.  This screen will display the clock, driving information (avg mpg, avg mph, etc...) Temperature, Radio display, as well as Air Conditioning information.  This screen is very nice and works great but a drawback is that when it comes into contact with sunlight the screen becomes hard to read.  The car has an  6 disc CD changer mounnted in the glove compartment and comes standard with a 6 speaker system that will satisfy all except the audiophiles.  The rear seats are adjustable(slide as well as tilt) and are very confortable.  One very useful feature that I have found is that in the rear of the RX300 there are hidden compartmens under the cargo mat.  There is one in the center and two on the side.  The two side compartments have drains so that you can store ice or cool drinks or other picnic items there.  The only negative I have found is that the trunk space is lacking compared to the 4Runner.

The RX300 was the Motor Trend Sport Utility of the Year and it is easy to see why they choose it.  With so many features and outstanding performance this SUV should be topping many people's list.  The RX300 comes in front wheel and full time 4 wheel drive.  This SUV starts at around 31000 for the base model(good luck looking for that) and will go to about 40000 for a fully loaded model.  I hope this has helped!<br><br>
