            We bought this car new and hope it lasts another 10 years.  Other than regular maintenance - oil changes, battery, tires, etc - this car has NEVER been in the repair shop.  It has over 100,000 miles on it.  It still looks great (other than a few paint chips) and the style is still modern and up-to-date.  

The seats are comfortable, the cargo area is roomy with tie-down straps for safety.  The huge sunroof extends over the back seat too so my kids love it.  It's kind of tight with three car seats in the back seat, but they fit without a problem.  

It has been involved in a few wrecks and also come out better than the other car!  A rear-end collision (my fault) that smashed the other car's backend only dented the plastic decorative covers on the middle of the bumper.  Another rear-end collision (not my fault) destroyed the front of the Lincoln Town Car and only scratched the bumper and tore the spare tire cover.

The steering is responsive.  The suspension is great.  There are a few blind spots but mostly due to the spare tire.  Gas mileage isn't all that great (17-19 city, 25 hwy), but that's what you expect from an SUV.

If something ever happens to this car, I would definitely buy a new one.
