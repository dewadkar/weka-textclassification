              The Sony Mavica FD-88 solves several problems with image storage that most other digital cameras have. Floppy disks are a great storage media because the portability is acceptable (some memory devices are smaller), and the biggest advantage in my opinion is the fact that you can insert the disk into ANY computer with a 3.5 floppy drive. No need for USB, special cradles or any of that stuff. Just take your pic and go. The optical zoom is good but the digital zoom is, like all digital zooms, really bites. You lose ALOT of resolution when the digital zoom is utilized. I think digital zooms on cameras are there just to sell cameras. When the enhancement is more than 1.5 or 2X quality suffers alot. On the plus side the lens is threaded to accept aftermarket optical zoom extenders or wide-angle lenses. The LCD display is pretty good, but the resolution is not really good enough to be able to use the manual focus feature. The &quot;Solar Window&quot; is also useless. The back light needs to be on all the time to see what's being displayed. Other than these small detractors, this is a great camera. It's pretty easy to learn and is lasts suprisingly long on a fully charged battery. If I were to do it over again, I'd probably go for a Nikon Cool-Pix but I am overall very satisified with my Sony.<br><br>
