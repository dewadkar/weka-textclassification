            I have been a fan of Subaru's since my brother bought a Legacy sedan back in '90. Since then, my mother has bought an Impreza in the mid 90's. I bought my Impreza Outback Sport Wagon (automatic) in Sept.'99 for my birthday.

What I love about this car: All Wheel Drive, 142 horsepower (not bad for a small car), fold down rear seats (for extra cargo space), the responsive handling (hugs the road like a sports car), gas mileage, roof rack, looks (uniquely different from everything else on the road), plows through anything the road throws at it (snow, mud, rain, potholes).

What I dislike: the cupholders are in awkward places, cabin gets noisy at higher speeds, engine hesitates slightly on acceleration while in gear, speakers on the inside of the front doors (acoustically unbalanced).

My other choices when I was shopping for a car were Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla. Both are high on car thieves lists, therefore insurance is slightly higher for these. Neither had AWD nor enough horsepower. Regardless to say I made my decision pretty quickly.

This car is excellent for city drivers who venture into the country or wilderness. It is reliable and require low maintenance and will last many years. If you haven't already, go test drive one.<br><br>
