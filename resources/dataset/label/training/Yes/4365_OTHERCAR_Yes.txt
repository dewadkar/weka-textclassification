            The 328 Convertible is the most remarkable vehicle I've had the pleasure of driving. It looks great, feels solid, handles beautifully and accelerates smoothly and rapidly. I am the original owner of this car and have experienced no significant mechanical problems with the vehicle in my 4 years driving it.

The car has maintained its sharp appearance. The only noticeable wear after 4 years is with the floormats, armrest and a portion of the driver's seat which gets rubbed when you exit and enter the car. Other than that, the car looks like I just drove it off the lot. The engine purrs quietly. 

I am 6'3", and the driver's seating verges on uncomfortable, but I have had no real problems. If you're taller than me however, your right knee may resent you.

Passengers in the back - I pity you. The 328ic was meant for a driver and a front seat passenger. Although there are two seats in the back, I think the designers were hoping that you either had no friends or that they were amputees. Be warned the legroom is ludicrous, even for folks of average height. And should you be tall like me and have the driver seat back- pity the poor soul behind you. His feet have no chance. Frequently, passengers in the back are forced to sit sideways.

The On-Board Computer is a nice novelty, but aside from telling you the temperature you'll seldom use the other features. Although it's nice to know what your average MPG have been, or how many miles you can go on your current tank of gas. But it shouldn't be a deal breaker.

Trunk space is abysmal. It will hold a single, not over-stuffed suitcase of average size. But you're not buying this car for its cargo capacity, you're buying it because you love to drive. It corners like a dream (the dream where you're cornering smoothly and much faster than the poor sod in the SUV).

This car has the Harmon Kardon sound system. I don't know what to compare it to, as I had previously only had AC/Delco and Toyota sound systems. It's definitely better. It's loud enough for my needs.

In all - I love this car. When I grow up I want to marry it.
