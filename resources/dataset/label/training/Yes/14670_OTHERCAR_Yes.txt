            I have a 1999 forester. I love it. It has been great so far. Good gas mileage, GREAT city driving; acceleration punch the gas and it will take off. Doesn't have very good acceleration on the highway though. One of the better things about the Forester is that it is very close to the ground. There is zero stepping up to get in like any ordinary SUV, it's like getting into a car. I like the fog light feature. They really cut right through the fog just like they are supposed to. For being a littler SUV it has a very big cargo area. The back seats fold down for even bigger items. The rear seat also recline just like the front seats do. Plenty of leg room throughout the vehicle. Another good feature is the compass pack. It has a digital compass and outside temperature as well as altimeter that displays the elevation of the area your in. One of the few things I disliked about this car is the gas tank has no locking device on it. Also, you can't open the rear hatchback from inside the car. Another thing I do not like is the rear windshield wiper has no time delay on it. One very good feature about the rear windshield wiper though, is that it has windshield washer fluid, so you can clean the back window, as well. As for the heat and air conditioning, they both work very well! This SUV has never been in the repair shop. I have taken it for all of its preventative maintenance checkups. Very quiet ride; can hardly feel the bumps unless they are really huge. The model I have is L and its is an automatic. It also has the AWD feature; all wheel drive. It uses all four wheels all the time. When you slip on ice and snow it automatically transfers power to the wheels that have the best traction. It will be your best friend in the snow. Better than all the other cars I've owned.<br><br>
