            We got rid of our 1996 Nissan Quest XE in 1999.   I am truly sorry to say that we were unhappy with it because we are Nissan lovers.  The first car we bought as a married couple was  a Nissan Sentra which we absolutely loved and owned until we drove it into the ground at over 150,000 miles.  It would have gone on longer if we had changed the timing belt, which we had never done, because it broke on the freeway torqueing the engine.  The next car we bought was a Nissan 200 SX, it also was an excellent car.  Then we bought a Nissan Maxima, my absolute favorite.  As you can see we love Nissans.  When it was time to buy a family mini-van our first
choice was a Nissan Quest.  But unfortunately, it was our last Nissan - at least for awhile.  

The first problem was a strange mildew smell coming from the air conditioning system.  I am not the only Quest owner that had this problem, I have spoken to others that had it also.  The Nissan dealers I took it to could never smell it of course and therefore said there was nothing they could do.  And the strange smell was not the only problem we had with the air conditioner.  The manifold to the air conditioner cracked two times at the cost of $400.00 to repair each time. 
 
The interior had  cloth seats that were very durable and comfortable.  But it was just too small for our growing family.  We had four children ranging in age from 1 to 11 at the time.   The engine, a 3.0 liter V6, with  four-speed automatic transmission was powerful enough.  We usually got about 23 miles to the gallon in town and 27 on the highway.  This is excellent gas mileage for a van.  We couldn�t complain there. 

We were used to having absolutely no problems or repairs with our other Nissans that is why we were surprised to have to replace the radiator, the brake rotors too soon, electrical problems, and the air conditioning problems.   

The straw that broke the camels back though, had to do with another strange smell.  I kept smelling a gasoline smell everytiime I drove with the window down.  We put  up with the smell for about 4 months when we decided we had better do something about it.   We called the Nissan dealer and they said to bring it in.  We brought it in and they just couldn�t find a fuel leak anywhere!  They said it was safe to drive.  But  I was pregnant and the smell was enough to make me gag.  Again, we put up with the smell for another few months.  We asked every mechanic we knew what they thought would cause the problem, no one knew.  Finally, we took it to a private mechanic and he couldn�t find anything wrong with it either, but he could definitely smell it.   On the way home from the mechanic we drove past a car dealership and on impulse (or disgust) traded in our Nissan on a full size Dodge Ram Van.   We found out later that the Dodge dealer found out that the gas smell problem was faulty fuel pump.  Not a difficult thing or expensive thing to repair, just irritating that the Nissan dealer could not spare us a year of smelling noxious fumes!  

Sorry Nissan, the Quest is a flop!
