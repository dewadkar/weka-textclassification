            when it comes to sporty, this car blows away the sportiness of the eclipse.  the key word to describe driving this car is varrooozoooooooom!

the gas mileage is totally killer for my husband, he has the ability to maintain 60 mpg back and forth to work (stop and go traffic) because he can lighten up the gas pedal and maintain the high mpg meter.  it is conveniently located on the display panel. how fast you are going. how many miles you have on the tank of gas, how many miles per gallon at any point on the trip. it is awesome.  I am more heavy on the gas pedal and so my freeway mileage is much lower at about 45 mpg.  we are getting close to 500 miles to the tank.

The ignition auto shut off took a little getting used to. Sitting at the stop sign. The car just shuts off, saving fuel and reducing emissions, in economy mode, this means that the a/c shuts off too. The engine is just so quiet when starting and running it is a little erie.  I like this car, it just gives me the giggles.

this car is still perfectly normal civic, so it does not look different. I love that. I do not want to drive something space aged, I want a nice normal sports car.  

The four doors are excellent for a family.  easy to get the car seats in and out.  A full size trunk, something that I was not expecting considering that is where the battery pack is stored.  There is room in the trunk for a nice big stroller, this is a great family car that is easy on the pocket book.  we are getting back and forth around town with two children in car seats with ease.

a nice pleasant sound system, lots of boom.  the light display took some getting used to, it has blue lights and that was unusual for me. but after 4 months, I do not even notice it.

Lots of room inside.  The seats are comfy, great lumbar support in the driver seat.  the arm rests are actually better padded than some higher priced vehicles.  my husband is 6ft 4in and has PLENTY of ROOM. Even in the rear seat, he was not cramped for leg room, a considerable concession.
