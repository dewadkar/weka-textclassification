            My previous car was a 1983 Honda Accord hatchback.  I loved that
car but I neglected it for a while and it finally died (rust, alternator,
and too many items of deferred maintenance to count).  After one
car-less month in a Michigan winter, it was time to get wheels again.

I was basically looking for a small 4-door sedan from any of
Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and I'm sure I would have driven other
imports of that class but didn't see any.  The 1993 Sentra I got
was a very clean car that had not seen any Michigan salty winters
and passed my mechanic's inspection (Bill Muncy Service in Ann 
Arbor) with flying colors.  They liked it, I figured I'd like it too.

It's a pretty nice car for what it is.  We put maybe 8000 miles a
year on it, which translates into a couple of long trips a year but
rarely more than a full tank of gas every week.  Repairs have been
minimal (new struts) and not expensive.  It runs well and handles
well on the road.

The back seat is small, really not all that suited for adults for any
length of time.  It's not a rocketship, but I knew that.  Some of
the rubber trim around the doors came detached and I haven't 
spent the time to stick it back into place.  

My rule for automobiles is to buy one every decade, and to buy
used.  That means this one should be expected to last until maybe
2004 or 2005, and I'm pretty sure that it will barring some 
calamity.<br><br>
