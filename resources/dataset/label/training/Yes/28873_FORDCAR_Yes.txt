            I recently bought a new 2000 Explorer XLT after driving my 1992 Explorer Sport into the ground.  I will be honest that I did not even shop around before buying my new explorer because I was so happy with my old one.  However, the newer models have even gotten better.  

The specific model that I purchased was the basic XLT package (which includes everything that I wanted including a keyless entry, power locks, radio with CD player/cassette, security system).  I recommend this package if you are looking for the convenience items, but not necessarily the luxury items that you would find in the Eddie Bauer package.  The keyless entry (the remote control button on your keyring to unlock the doors) is wonderful, especially when it is raining and you don't want to have to fumble to get your key in the door, or when you have an armful of groceries and don't want to have to put them down.  I also like that this remote provides a panic button which makes me feel safer when approaching my car in a dark parking lot. The stereo system has a great feature where passengers in the back seat can plug in headphones and listen to a different radio station or CD than what the driver is listening to.  This works out great when my husband wants to listen to the football games and I want to listen to music.  One other great feature of this car is the security system.  They have these new keys that actually have a computer chip in the key itself and cannot be duplicated anywhere except at the dealership with both of your original keys.  Due to the computer chip, there is no way that the car can be hotwired or that another key will work.  Trust me on this one and take warning...DO NOT accidentally put the wrong key in the ignition...I did this and had a very hard time getting it out.  I called roadside assistance and everything.  Luckily we finally got it out but I learned to look very closely at my keys before just automatically sticking them in the ignition.

The only extra that I purchased was the 6 CD changer.   In hindsight, I would not have paid the money to have this item installed at Ford and would have shopped around as I think that you could probably get a much better deal at Audio Buys or Circuit City.

Regarding the way the car drives, it is a very smooth ride and has great pick-up.  On downside is that it tends to use a lot of gas and I have found that it only averages about 13-14 miles per gallon city driving.  However, I don't think that many SUV's are going to do much better.

One other small thing that I don't like about this Explorer is that it takes a very long time to warm up.  On cold mornings, it takes about 15 minutes before I can comfortably turn on the heat.

Despite the few small things that I would change about this car, it is still by far the best car that I have ever had.  It is comfortable to drive and ride in. All of the seats are comfortable but the lumbar support on the drivers seat is marvelous!  It is very practical for anyone who ever has to move anything large around.  One you get used to just being able to throw anything in the back, you will never be able to go back to a regular car again.  Most of all, I feel safe driving in this car.  It's got the standard airbags, but more importantly, I feel safe in a sturdy car that sits high off the ground.<br><br>
