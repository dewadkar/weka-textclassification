            NOTE - This is an Update since the firmware was upgraded

This is a great camera. It is my second digital, my first being a 1.3 Fuji Finepix, the MX1200. The comparison is astounding. 

The fact that the Toshiba is a 2.2 MP was the first thing i noticed after taking my first shot. The clarity of the shots are completely photo realistic. I was truthfully disappointed with the results with a 1.3 MP camera and this was the principal reason i upgraded. It was a smart move in that regard.

The camera has a nice feel to it. Whereas my Fuji was very lightweight, it lacked the feel of a 'real' camera. The weight behind the Toshiba gives it an almost professional quality and feel. This can be to its disadvantage as well, since it is too bulky to be considered a good pocket camera (Don't expect to carry this around in your jeans).

The functions are all brilliant. There is a wide array of features which allow some experimenting with shots and also allow for some good manual control for those situations which require, for example if there was some poor lighting.  Lighting WAS a major issue with this camera but not since the firmware upgrade.  The Quality is far better now, though there are some times it CAN be troublesome.  In terms of other features, I was glad to see the status display which allows you to view your camera settings without having regard to the actual LCD.

The shots are incredible when there is good lighting. By good lighting, I should note that sunlight, incandescent and even good natural light indoors would be considered good light.  Like most digital cameras, there is SOME cause for grief in very low lighting in terms of focusing issues.  For those who are reading this UPDATED opinion, they will note that i have had less complaints since the firmware upgrade. Thanks Toshiba Support!

If you are still one who has suffered this focus problem and have NOT got the upgraded firmware,I have a good way to trick the camera into focusing. If there is not enough light on your subject, focus on something brighter of comparable distance, keep your finger with the focus locked and then aim on your subject. Take your shot and Voila! You have your focused shot.  This works almost all the time, provided the subjects are more or less the same distance away.I wish Toshiba would come up with a firmware upgrade to fix the poor focus and poor shots in low light. So far I havent seen one on their website.

The camera is a memory hog (each shot at maximum resolution is roughly 1 MB! ). This is partly due to the fact that we are dealing with a 2.2 MP camera. I have a 64MB and 32MB card and this is sufficient for a lengthy shooting session. I love the fact that it uses SmartMedia, a very popular media type. Very easily acquired, even in the Caribbean where I live.

One more thing to look for, I find it useful to take the shots with the camera using the viewfinder. Not only will this save battery life, but the camera tends to motion blur very easily and having it braced against your face tends to reduce this somewhat. Taking shots with the LCD and holding camera away from my face has caused me many blurry, unusable exposures. Especially in low lighting.

By the waw, the Macro feature is incredible! The clarity is more than I ever expected for such a reasonably priced camera.

This camera is a breath of fresh air having used the 1.3 Fuji Finepix for over a year. Though that camera DID take good shots in low light as well as good light, the quality of the shots was no where near as good as with the Toshiba. An agreeable trade off I would admit.  

One final thought, for those who have considered that this camera is not good at focusing in the dark, check your firmware version and compare it to the new one at the Toshiba website. A simple upgrade may be all you need! It changed my appreciation of this camera from a 4 star to a 5 star!
