            If you are fairly specific about why you want a digital camera, and your reasons match mine, then this is a great camera.  If you want a camera that is versatile and dependable then spend more money on something else.  Here's why i think that:

I bought this camera because I really wanted a digital camera that was easy.  The mavica's ability to put the photos on a disc instead of having to download them into my computer was really attractive to me, and so I bought this model.  At first I was a little disappointed because the pictures seemed to be pixellated a lot, so I read the directions and found that if I used the fine quality feature the pictures looked much better.  

Most of my photos were extreme close-ups, and they were great.  Using the fine quality setting and taking close-ups I couldn't have been happier. the colors come out true, the amount of detail that comes out is great, and the ease of taking, saving, keeping, deleting photos is amazing. HOWEVER, I had the occasion of taking some big pictures, like my house from the road, and again they are all pixellated or blurry even on high quality.  This goes double for using the flash.  If you use the flash in a close-up situation, its a great camera, if you use it from any sort of a distance, the pictures come out blurred and/or pixellated.

So, if you are looking for a great close-up camera, this is a good one.<br><br>
