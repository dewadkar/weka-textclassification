            I got my neon last year used while look for a car to replace the one that was fixing to stop working.  I and my wife and been all over and even started leaving the kids at home while searching since all they ever did anyway is talk the salesman into letting us take test drives all the time.  It has been a long day and we had the kids with us at this point when we decided to make one more stop off at a dealer and just see what they had.  We walked all over the lot and my eyes would stray to the convertibles, but..that was not on the list for a 2nd vehicle, so, I continued my search.  I had noticed this cobalt blue car that had a funny-looking front end but had a nice, sporty look overall.  The kids admired the car and talked about how big the backseat was and stated they would like it if Dad got this car.  I looked at the car and the salesman came out and of course, suggested the test drive, and so..we all piled in to the car and we were off. It was a little cramped  with 6 of us ( I have 4 kids), but..the backseat was roomy and I liked the way the car drove.  The neon was standard and the shifting was smooth, gas mileage was great, and room was fine.  The only thing I didn't like too much was the room in the front.  To allow for the back seat to have more room, they took some from the front, but, there is still room for your legs.  The Plymouth Neon is a good second car that drives great, smooth shifting, and great gas mileage.  It works for me.<br><br>
