               My father bought this, a "program" of 16K miles, within a year of its manufacture.  I took it over after his having
placed approximately 100-130K miles upon it, and have driven
and maintained it ever since.  I've had to replace the radiator, the alternator, and other various and sundry parts over the years, but nothing really major.  The I-4 engine and automatic transmission are original, with 235,000+ miles on the odometer and virtually little maintenance, and perhaps, yet no more than, a modest amount of abuse.  The bolts that once fastened the air conditioning unit to the engine block have long since fallen out along the wayside, thus requiring use of the
shorter serpentine belt(for those models that came without
air.)  I could easily repair it, as I've effected most every
one myself, and with the thinking that I'd do so in haste, for I live in the extreme NW corner of Mississippi, but I simply haven't gotten a "Round-2-It"... 

...beyond bad, I know.

   I drive the "shuttle"...everywhere, as I am a field repair technician for a major grocery chain.  De Soto 
County, Mississippi is just right below Memphis, and 
from there I travel to Jackson, the state capital, and beyond to McComb which is only a little over one hundred miles from New Orleans, and throughout the state...Little Rock, Arkansas, and Russellville 80 miles beyond to the west...Paducah and Murray in Kentucky...all of western Tennessee...and most every point within the described radius.  Now you know where all of those miles went.
I've only had one or two breakdowns during all of those
trips taken over the last three years, but neither ever
resulted in a tow...how 'bout it?

   Now, for maintenance...when the battery light comes on,
don't fool around.  Replace the alternator and/or the battery, particularly the former, as I've had quite the
experiences, and AutoZone's "Carbon Metallic" front brake disc pad replacements with a lifetime warranty can't be beat.  Well, maybe they can, but I don't research brake
pads when in a pinch.  Also, the "shuttle" balks at prolonged use of 87 octane;  conversely, she sings at
89 or higher.  Replacement of spark plugs and their 
wires may reduce vibration whilst idling, and keep an eye 
on the cooling system and ~ALL~ of the parts thereof.  I carry not only the original "doughnut" spare but also a full-sized one, too.  If you see a lot of oil on and about the engine, particularly within the spark plug wells, replace the valve cover gasket...

...or worse...

   In conclusion, if you can work on cars, 'tis a match
made in hubcap heaven.

Oh, and one more thing, and in response to "technologyrep"'s review...

When GM hands you a lemon, and you then attempt to make lemonade, it's sure to taste oily.

Ta-da!
