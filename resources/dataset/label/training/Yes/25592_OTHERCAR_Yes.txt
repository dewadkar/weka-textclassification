            We purchased a 1999 Saab 9-3 just over a year ago and have absolutely loved the car! This has been the most enjoyable car to drive that I have ever owned. When the turbo kicks in, be prepared to zoom past your fellow drivers. I am not a person who particularly enjoys driving, but have found this vehicle to be a joy to drive. The only thing that has not thrilled me about the car is that the rear-visibility is not the best. I can't compare to other vehicles in its class as it is the only one I have driven, but I like the drive enough that I would definitely consider another Saab in the future and would recommend it to anyone. We have not had any problems with the car, it has been very reliable. The front seats are extremely comfortable for lengthy drives, but I would limit the backseat to children if you are taking a road trip.<br><br>
