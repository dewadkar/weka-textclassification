            People thought I was nuts when I said I wanted a big car that handled like a sports car. I like the safety and comfort of a big car, but don't like the "boatiness" of most big cars, especially for mountain driving (curvy roads at 65+ miles per hour). I found both in the Regal LS. Now, granted, it has a little more road noise than I like (I'd prefer none), but the handling and ride is fantastic. You really "stick to the road" in turns, and easily can make fast manuevers to avoid fender benders in traffic. It even handles very well on slippery roads, as you can "feel" the road through the steering wheel and drive your car appropriately. As far as the turning radius, I think it's quite good for the size of the car. My car is the same length as my husband's Blazer, and I can make tighter turns in my Regal than I can with his Blazer. 

My car has very comfortable leather seats, and it feels like you're sitting inside an oversized sports car, not a large passenger car. My husband and I always take my car on any distance trips as it's very comfortable both to drive and ride as a passenger, and gets good gas mileage. Even passengers in the rear seat have commented on how comfortable even riding in the back is.

The trunk is amazingly huge!! Since the back seats fold down independantly, I can carry loads equal to my husband's SUV. Even without the seats folded down, I would estimate that one could almost put a 10-speed in the trunk and close the lid. The rear seats also have shoulder harnesses, which is going to be very helpful with our newborn.

The digital controls are in easy reach, including stereo/cd controls built into the steering wheel, so you can keep both hands on the wheel while flipping through stations, cds or cassettes, and adjusting volume. 

I don't like the control for the airflow/AC, as its merely a toggle button that forces you to "page" through all of the options to reach the one you want and makes it necessary to watch the digital display to see the different settings (I would prefer a knob or slide lever that I would be able to adjust from memory by the position of the toggle). 

The only thing I really hate about this car is that the brakes shudder. It scared the hell out of me when I was coming down a mountain, as the steering wheel and the whole front end shuddered horribly. I soon discovered that my father-in-law's Le Sabre does exactly the same thing. I plan to have it adjusted, but sincerely hope that Buick is looking into fixing this problem. 

In summary, I feel that this is an excellent blend of a sport and luxury vehicle at a very reasonable price. It would take an additional $10,000 or more to go to the next level of vehicle in my opinion.
