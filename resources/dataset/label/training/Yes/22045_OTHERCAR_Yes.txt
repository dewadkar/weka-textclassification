            When I started the hunt for a new digital camera, I didn't know where to start.  There are SOO many different kinds and prices out there that I was overwhelmed.  I started with the Sunday ads and found a few that were on sale.  

Then guess where I went??  EPINIONS, of course!!  I read and read and read and got great information on different cameras, but no one told me WHY they picked that one over the others and WHERE to get the best deal.  So, I was on my own.  

Well, mostly what I needed was a camera with flash (I have a cheapie now that does not have flash, but worked good outside so I used it for eBay pics on sunny days on the back lawn), that took good pictures with a decent resolution that was easy to use and easy to get pictures off of.  I also wanted one with minimal delay between when you press the button and the picture gets taken (try getting a good pic of an active 2 year old with a shutter delay!!).  

I had heard SOO many good things about the Sony Mavicas, but I wasn't convinced that I had to spend $500+ to get what I needed.  I realized that the rest of the cameras, for the most part, use tiny little disks that you can either ignore and just plug the camera into your computer to get pics (drains battery), buy an adaptor like a floppy disk to stick it in ($80+) or buy a reader which is like an extra disk drive ($70+) adding to the cost.  What I DID like is that these &quot;cards&quot; come in different sizes, so you CAN get ones that hold well over 100 pictures.  Nice for traveling!!  Also, since most digital cameras drain batteries, you either want one with a rechargeable battery, buy rechargeable batteries and a charger or get one with an A/C adaptor.  

After looking around and comparing features, I chose the Kodak DC215 Millenium edition.  Why??
 - 2 different resolution settings - smaller resolution means more pics on the disk and less room online.  They have 1152X864 as their &quot;good&quot; setting (quite good) and 640x480 as their other setting (still quite passable)
 - 2X optical zoom - would have liked one with more zoom capabilities, but I am mostly using this to take still pics of clothes to sell on ebay, so decided I could do without this feature.
 - EASY TO USE!!  The screen on the back takes you through all the features and it is easy to change settings.  
 - COMES WITH THE UCB READER.  This was a biggie.  I did not want to have to spend the extra money for this, but really felt it was necessary for ease of use.
 - Comes with an 8MB CompactFlash card (the little disk) which was more than the 4MB that many of them came with.

It really looked like the camera to fulfill my needs.  Well - then I had to find where to get the best deal.  I went to all the normal real life places - Best Buy, Circuit City etc and most of them only had the regular Kodak DC215 camera and it ran about $399 on sale.  The ones that did have the Millenium Edition ran around $450+.  So, I went online.  

First, I checked out stores through eBates.com because they offer money back.  I found HardwareStreet.com and they had a great price: $295.99 plus $7.20 shipping.  Also, I did not have to pay sales tax through them.  Looked good, so I placed the order.  Being VERY impatient and really wanting this camera, when 3 days passed and I did not get a shipping confirmation in my e-mail, I called them, the nice lady told me that although it does not say there on their site, there is a 10-14 day wait after orders are placed for them to be able to get the order to their warehouse, place the order and ship it.  Wonderful - NOT.  I promptly cancelled my order!!  

So, I went to the next best place - EggHead.com.  Their price was $288.99 with free regular shipping, but I had to pay tax with them and no eBates rebate, so it was slightly more.  I chose to pay an extra $12.99 for second day shipping because I was REALLY anxious to get this camera.  Well, there were problems there too (a story for another ePinion), but I did not want to order anywhere else and did not want to go back to Best Buy, so I waited it out.  They did give me free second day shipping, so it was a good deal money-wise.  

I got the camera yesterday and I LOVE it.  It is very easy to use and I was ready to go in a matter of minutes.  The pictures are sharp and clear and I barely need to do any photo editing at all. 

If you are in a hurry to get this camera, I would recommend spending the extra money and get it at a store.  If you don't mind waiting a few weeks, either of the above stores had the best deal price-wise that I could find online.

*** text added 6/10 ***  It has now been several months since I bought this camera and I am still as happy with it as the day I bought it.  I had heard so much about how digital cameras eat batteries for breakfast, but this one is great.  The millenium edition had claimed to be more battery efficient, and they are true to their claims.  I have taken SEVERAL hundred pictures with this and have had to change the batteries twice.  They take 4 regular AA batteries, so its not real expensive to replace them.  I have gotten so many compliments on my pictures and I recommend this camera to all my friends!!<br><br>
