            I leased a 1999 nissan altima about 2 years ago.  I had been driving a truck and needed more room to haul people and things around.  I have extremely enjoyed having this car.  I have a 4 cylinder.  It has more power than any other 4 cylinder I have driven.  There are many cool features from sunroof, tilt steering, cruise control, power everything, CD player, etc.  I was recently in an automobile accident and I believe this car is what saved us.  We were hit from behind extremely hard.  Neither my husband or I were wearing seat belts (I do not recommend this!).  The car buckled at the rear absorbing alot of the impact.  It handled extremely well.  I love to drive my vehicle.  It is so comfortable and stylish.  I think everyone should buy this vehicle.  It is very roomy, so even a big family could enjoy it.  <br><br>
