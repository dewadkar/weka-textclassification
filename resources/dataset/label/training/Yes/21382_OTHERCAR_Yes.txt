            This year we traded our 4-Runner for a Camry.  I was worried at first with the 4 cylinder engine that we have trouble on the highway.  The first trip we made was a pleasant surprise.  I don't know what they did, but the Camry will get out there and run with the best of them.  The car is very comfortable and is great on long trips.  You really don't feel tired after driving all day as was the case with the 4-Runner.  There is plenty of leg room and head room even in the back seat.  
This car is really a gas miser.  We Live in Georgia and my parents live in Louisiana.  This is a 570 trip one way.  We can get about 500 miles before refilling.  To me this is unbelievable.  If you are in the market for a new car, you really need to look at the Toyota Camry.<br><br>
