            ***April 2003*** update below original review.

I have had possession of my BMW 325XI since June 22, 2002.  I was tempted to write my review a week or two after I picked it up but resisted until now so that I could minimize my &#147new car owner bias&#148 in this assessment of the vehicle.  The extra time has also allowed me to use additional car functions (defroster and heated seats) due to the changing seasons here in Colorado.

My BMW&#146s specifications
Rather than purchase a car that was in the inventory of the dealership or a vehicle that was already in production I customized my car.  I figured if I was going to spend this much on a car I might as well get what I want.  The trade-off is that I had to wait about 10 weeks for the car to be delivered, but on the other hand I saved about $2500.  The primary issue was that I wanted manual transmission and the dealership primarily stocks automatics because that is what most buyers want.  Automatic transmission alone is a $1400 option.  I also wanted some of the items in the premium package but I wanted the titanium interior trim instead of wood.  The premium package only comes with wood trim so customization was the best approach for me.  What I ordered was:
&#61607; All-wheel drive
&#61607; Manual transmission
&#61607; Orient Blue exterior / black leather interior
&#61607; Titanium trim
&#61607; Cold weather package (only for the fold down rear seat)
&#61607; Trunk mounted 6 CD-Changer (dealer installed)
&#61607; Tinted windows (dealer installed)
&#61607; Power moon roof
&#61607; Alarm system (dealer installed)
&#61607; On board computer
&#61607; Power front seats with driver memory

All together with dealer handling and taxes it came to approximately $34500.00.  Most of the 325Xis on the lot had sticker prices of $37000 or more because they included automatic transmission and were equipped with all of the available packages.  Because I was willing and able to wait, ordering the vehicle as I wanted it has contributed to my overall satisfaction with the car.

Driving Experience
In all the research I did before purchasing the car and the reading I did while waiting for it to arrive, I read many references to the responsiveness of the vehicle and how well it handled.  I experienced some of that during the test drive but certainly not enough to comprehend the adoration that many car enthusiasts heaped on the BMW driving experience.  Well, after driving my car every day for 2 ï¿½ months I can say now that &#147the ultimate driving machine&#148 is an on the money accurate slogan.  As I am cruising down I-25 to my job in downtown Denver every morning I am in a complete comfort zone.  I arrive to work everyday in a great mood despite the 5 year construction project that is part of my morning commute.  I am not technically savvy enough about cars to describe handling in &#147gearhead&#148 terms, but when I want to make a quick move in highway traffic the 325XI does not disappoint.  The fastest I have driven the car is at around 95 mph on a uphill stretch between Colorado Springs and Denver - it had more than enough power and the ride was as smooth as if I were going 40 mph.   I read one review of the car that said it seems &#147to know what you want to do before you do it&#148, which is exactly how I feel when driving.

The controls for the radio/CD-player on the steering wheel are a great feature and the buttons for controlling the air conditioning / heat take a little getting used to but once learned are easy to use.  The buttons for controlling the heated seats and stability control are awkwardly located (below the ashtray compartment) which has led me to occasionally turn them on and not know it until my behind feels a warming trend.  Other than that quirk I think the layout of the dash is simplistic and has a nice clean feel.         

Minor Issues
Okay the car isn&#146t perfect &#150 there are a few minor annoyances.  After a few weeks I found myself wishing that I had opted for the upgraded Harmon/Kardon sound system.  The standard system comes with a single in-dash CD player, radio and 10 speakers, but somehow there isn&#146t enough bass and most of my CD&#146s sound a little off.  Every time I play a new CD I find myself fiddling with the bass and treble trying to get the right sound to come out of at least one of those 10 speakers.  I have not heard the upgraded sound system but I&#146m guessing it is worth the extra $600 or $700 dollars.

As I mentioned the in dash CD player is standard (although I opted for a changer as well) but if you are going to have multiple CDs in your car you are going to be hard pressed to find somewhere to store them.  Without the premium package there is no center console (which is just odd), and the storage compartments are few and far between.  There are door pockets on each of the front doors, a small glove box and one small compartment in the center dash (so small that I can only fit a credit card sized parking card and my sunglasses in it).  Fortunately, I am not the type to keep a lot of stuff in my car, but this could be a bigger annoyance for anyone who does.

In many reviews you will read about the supposed lack of power in the 325XI that has lead many people to move up to the BMW 330.  I think this lack of power is more pronounced in an automatic than in the manual transmission.  I have felt it, especially when taking off from a stoplight with the air conditioning blowing on a 90 degree day.  Once I get to 2nd gear it is a non-issue.  I don&#146t think the additional power you get from the 330 is worth the $7000 difference in price, but it is something to keep in mind.

Final Words
I am looking forward to driving my car in the winter when I can test how the all-wheel drive handles.  I will update this review when I get that opportunity.  Also, since the first scheduled maintenance, an oil change, is at 15,000 or so miles (the car tells you when it needs maintenance and it adjusts based on how you drive) I can&#146t comment on the servicing issue just yet either.   

So far I would say that the 325XI is worth every penny that I have spent.  It is a joy to drive and lives up the BMW reputation.   My buying experience (a combination of e-mail communication and closing the deal in person) was the best car-buying experience I have ever had &#150 my compliments to Ralph Schomp BMW in Littleton, CO!

Updated information

April 2003

Well I am finally getting around to updating my &#147e-pinion&#148.  It has been nearly 7 months since I wrote the initial review so I have owned my BMW for 10 months.  During that time I have experienced driving in all the weather Colorado has to offer &#150 extreme heat, rain, snow, fog, icy roads, smooth dry pavement, etc.

What Stands Out?
On a daily basis I marvel at how easy it is for me to focus on driving the car because I don&#146t have other distractions that I have had in previous cars.  The options and standard features I have work so well that I don&#146t have to fiddle with them for the duration of any trip. The climate control is one example.  I have settled on 70 degrees being the comfortable temperature for me so every morning I just push the AUTO button and that&#146s it.  Regardless of the temperature (and there was a stretch of sub-zero mornings in February) the car evenly heats to 70 and I never have to think about it again.  That may seem trite, but really when I am not having to worry about getting heat on my feet or being too warm I can focus on driving.

Another example is the defroster.  Honestly, in 9 months time I have used the defrosted fewer than 5 times.  The climate control works well enough that it really isn&#146t necessary to use the defroster that much even during the winter in Colorado.  On the rare occasions when it has been in use it was a matter of turning it on &#150 and about 15 seconds later turning it off because the windows are completely clear.  I was surprised initially because the defroster comes on full blast and is quite loud , but it does the job in a short period of time.

Cruise control, radio/stereo controls on the steering wheel  work flawlessly and again help me to focus on driving and enjoying the ride.

Any Surprises?
I opted for the cold weather package primarily to get the rear fold down seats.  With the package came heated front seats which I never would have selected as a separate item.  Boy have those seats come in handy during our winter cold spell. I am genuinely surprised at how much I use them and now I would consider them a must have.

Another piece of the cold weather package are the headlight washers. Unlike what you see on some Volvos they are not actual wiper blades but rather washer fluid is sprayed on to the headlights every 10th time you squirt the washer fluid on your windshield.  When my car has been caked with the grime that comes after driving through snow it doesn&#146t seem that the headlight washers do much good.  More often than not when they activate I always feel like other drivers think I am spraying my headlights to show off, when in fact I have no control over when it happens.

I have been pleasantly surprised at the gas mileage &#150 I am averaging around 26 or 27 miles to the gallon in every day driving and as much as 32 mpg on the highway.

How does the AWD handle in the snow?
In a word &#150 perfectly.  In March 42 inches of snow fell in my neighborhood in roughly 30 hours.  While I wasn&#146t driving around when the snow was the deepest, I did drive home during the early stages of the storm when the snow was 6 &#150 8 inches deep on the roads.  At one point I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed an Audi A4, a Corolla, a Ford Probe and a Jeep Liberty all following my trail.  I have never had an AWD vehicle before (always front wheel drive) so I have no point of comparison, but the traction and control in snow and on slippery streets was flawless.  It is another thing BMW got right.

Anything I would do differently if I were buying the car today?
I would probably opt for the premium stereo.  The standard sound system isn&#146t bad, but I always feel like the sound is not quite right.  Before the end of the year I will likely opt for new rims &#150 again the standard ones are more than adequate but I think upgraded ones will only improve the look of the vehicle.  Otherwise I wouldn&#146t change a thing.  I love the color (inside and out), the fit and finish and the options. 

In Summary
I can&#146t forget to mention that after 10 months of daily driving (about 11000 miles) I have yet to visit the dealership for service.  I am still 4000+ miles away from my first oil change and there have been absolutely no other problems.  The only service the car has had is a car wash and washer fluid re-filled.  Not only do I have a great car to drive, but the lack of visits for service has given me back time!  What more can you ask for?
