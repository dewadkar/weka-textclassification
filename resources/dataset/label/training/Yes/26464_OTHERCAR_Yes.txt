            Our 1993 Jeep Cherokee has 120,000 miles on it.  We have only just recently put a new radiator, water pump and a hose from the transmission.  Motor has been exceptional!  We bought this jeep used from a Nissan dealer.  It had a 7/70 warranty.  The only thing we had to replace just after buying it was something to do with the power steering. think.  It was nothing big and it was covered under the warranty.  Hassle-free.  This jeep has plenty of room for the kids and dog.  It isn't 4-wheel drive so we don't go off the road too much.  That's also one downfall - I think if we went off the road, it would jar our teeth right out!  It is a rough ride.  It's very bouncy and would probably be easy to lose control of on a dirt/gravel road at any speed above 40.  You really have to be careful when driving it.  But I love it!  It has been reliable, dependable, and full of power with 6.0 engine.  There's plenty of room for tall people in the front seat.  The back seat has average leg room and you have to sit with your knees bent.  You can't stretch out too much in the back seat.  But overall, it's plenty roomy and it's comfortable enough for a trip down a smooth road.
