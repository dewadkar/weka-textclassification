            This Car was originally purchased cause I needed a car Really bad.  It turned out to be one of the best cars that Ive had.  It is an older model...1986, but other than normal age problems, it is a really good car.
It has been reliable.  It has over 200,000 miles on it and still running strong.  Ive had to replace a few parts on it, but thats just normal wear and tear.  It is easy to work on.  Cost for parts is low to moderate.  If your looking for a good second car just to get around in...This One is it.<br><br>
