              Having always been interested in Photography digital cameras had been on my wish list for some. Quality of pictures and price kept me from buying a digital until this year when so many advances have been made and the price dropped to where its affordable. 
  I bought the Nikon Coolpix 950. It had most of the features I wanted but was still a trade off. No one digital camera has every feature. I narrowed it down to the Sony Mavica and the Nikon. The Sony's big advantage was the use of floppies for picture storage. The Nikon had   Optical viewing an well as the lcd screen.
  The Coolpix has been a delight to work with after I learned all the features. Check that I'm still learning after almost a year. It has more features than I'll use. In the auto mode, which is the mode I started in, its point and shoot.  Gradually I learned to use some of the program modes with individual settings.
  The picture quality is excellent. I have been able to make excellent 8x10's that are not distinguishable from good 35 mm's. Color rendition to my eyes appears very accurate.
