            I have used 35 mms from a 1930 Certo Dolina through to point and shoots.  The time to finish a roll and get developed and then what to do with the photos that are extra/left over that you mean to mail out.  Still have photos from 1980s in their envelopes to send to friends and family.  Kids are older and some of the recepients are dead! 

Borrowed an older Mavica and loved the ease of use of diskettes, but the picture quality was nothing to brag about.  Wanted my own, and fell in love with this unit.  6X optical zoom, with 2X digital.  pop up menu makes viewing and saving or deleting a snap.  While there are smaller cameras, the memory is expensive -- everyone with a computer has a surfeit of diskettes mating in drawers and cabinets.  

But the hottest feature is the ability to record MPEGs.  Particularly with kids, most of what I have video'd in the past has been in 5 - 15 second bursts.  This will record up to 60 seconds on a diskette at standard resolution.  Have found that average time is 10 seconds and you can default to 5 / 10 / 15 second bursts or continuous while holding down the shutter release.

Uses a rechargable Sony battery, that has great life and recharges quickly.  So far have not found the battery life limiting, unlike some of them that use regular AA batteries (25 photo life) or the more expensive camera batteries (+/- 100 photos).  Went to a soccer tournament, shot pictures, recharged between games and did the next one.  Also great training tool to show them what their body is doing when executing a play.    

But by far the most exciting feature, is the ability to give someone a copy of the pic or mpeg on the spot on another diskette.   I looked at all the other cameras out there, and the only other one that was more appealing was the Mavica FD-88 for another $200, which was more than I wanted to spend.  I have gotten memorable soccer and football shots.  Got pictures of a friend's girls while she was laid up with a broken wrist and I took them to a local pool with a slide.  She felt better being able to quickly share what her girls did that day. 

And can email photos to friends and family, or stick one on a standard letter.  Will do my own Christmas card this year.  I recommend you borrow various cameras and see how you like them.

The only drawback is its size (holds a diskette).  And it is heavier than others, but well designed ergonomically so not uncomfortable.<br>
