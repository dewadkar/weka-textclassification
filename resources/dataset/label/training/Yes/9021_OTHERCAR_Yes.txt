            When my husband and I decided to look at a new car I was very skeptical about Kia.  They are a fairly new car company and I really don't know that much about cars.  I took it for a test drive anyway and I was impresses by the way it handled, for a SUV.  It was easy to see where I was going and easier to parallel park than my old vehicle (a S-10 Blazer).

So we bought the Sportage.  After owning it for a year there are several things that I don't like about it.  First of all, the brakes and tires are cheap.  If you don't put the optional brake covers on you'll have heavy brake dust on your front rims.  And after only 13,000 miles the tires slide in the rain.  The back hatch is hard to close and unless you slam it with all your might it won't close completely and you'll have to use your key to open the lock and try again.  Also, on my Kia there is a problem with water leaking in the doors.  They've changed the rubber around the doors but that didn't work.  I'm still trying to get this taken care of.

Now for the interior.  I do like the split fold down seats in the back.  It's very convieniant for longer items when you have a child who rides in the back.  Some of the controls are difficult to reach, such as the hazard lights or the air conditioner, when the cup holder is in use.  I've also found the horn is difficult to operate but I'm not sure how much of that is because of the air bag.

Even with all of these problems, I still like my Kia. It's cute (a woman's opinion) and it handles great.  It does good in the snow and does great on gas.  It gets me where I'm going and that's the most important thing.
