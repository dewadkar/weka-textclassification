            perosnally i think this is one of the best SUV's in the world! I have one my self and it has everything you would ever want in a car. There is also a big back seat so if you want to get your women back there then you are all set! The best feature is that it is a tank! I got rear-ended and and i destroyed the other truck! Another good thing is that the top radio system in the car is really good. I also think this is one of the bst features! You could also run over basically anything that you want to! You could also get a V8 5.9 engine too. i highly recommend it! <br><br>
