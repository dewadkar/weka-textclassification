            Volkswagon's New Beetle is a car that is not only fun but is practical, too.It attracts plenty of attention and you'll find people of all ages taking a second look as you drive around town.<br>The Beetle looks small from the outside, but once inside you'll find it has plenty of room and is very comfortable!  You can comfortably fit four people in this car.  Over and over, I've had people tell me how surprised they are at the room inside.  There's plenty of room in the trunk, too!<br>After admiring the Beetles for many months, I was fortunate to find this &quot;surprise&quot; sitting in my garage one day.  We traded in a larger sedan when we got our Beetle, and our entire family is very happy with our new vehicle!<br>If there was one feature I'd like to have on the car that it didn't come with, I'd have to say that would be power windows.  The manual handles to roll up the windows are slightly difficult to crank.  The only other thing I'd have to add about the car is that the black cloth seats do take some effort to keep them looking nice and clean.  But these two &quot;drawbacks&quot; are nothing compared to the many things we all LOVE about our new Beetle.  I'd recommend them to singles and also to families. They're so much fun to drive and they're great cars!<br><br><br>
