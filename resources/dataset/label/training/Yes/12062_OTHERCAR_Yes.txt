            This car is amazing.  I bought this base model Carrera used with 12,000 miles on it.  It has the 6 speed manual gearing, the leather interior, and 18" sport classic II rims.  This car turns on a dime and has amazingly quick and smooth acceleration.  The engine just never seems to complain, even at the red line.  Cornering is so accurate, I can't imagine what it would take to oversteer this vehicle.  The only way you won't enjoy driving this car is if you're stuck in traffic.  Give yourself some time to learn the clutch - and it might take some effort to find a stretch of road to use 6th gear.
Only problem to date after 12 months and 3000 miles is an engine sensor light - an oxygen sensor was replaced under warranty.  There is a very slight vibration in the steering wheel around 65 mph - which is due to tires - next time I'm getting Michelin's or Pirelli's.  Recently I experimented with 18" chrome turbo twist rims - they give the ocean blue car a sportier look.
The "upgraded" factory stereo in this car bites.  The stock stereo in a 2000 VW Golf blows it away.  For the money Porsche gets for these vehicles, I can't believe they can't offer a better stereo.
The interior of the car is a nice fit for me, and provides a nice view of the dash and the outside world.  The automatic seat adjustment that also offers more types of seat adjustment is an option I wish the car had.  The seat is comfortable, but not the best bucket seat I've ever sat in.  Xenon headlights should be stock this day and age, especially for such a high dollar car, but the headlights are sufficient.
Possibly the best part about this car is the reaction you get from others.  It is a step up on the exotic car food chain from the BMW I almost bought.
This car is exactly what you would expect from a serious driving machine designed by Porsche.
