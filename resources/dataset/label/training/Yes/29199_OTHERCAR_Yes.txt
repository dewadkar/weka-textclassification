            This car is perfect if you live in a city. You can fit in anywhere and carry plenty of stuff around with you. You walk down from your cramped apartment into your Neon and get to where you want. It has good handling, but the legroom in back isn't much to speak of. I would for sure want to buy a Neon if I only had to drive me and my stuff around. There isn't much room for other people to get in as well. You can drive down the street, be entertained by its features, and get around in style with this car.<br><br>
