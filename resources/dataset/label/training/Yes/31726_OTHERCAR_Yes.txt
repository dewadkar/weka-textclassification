            I owned a base model 2000 Dodge Intrepid for 3 years.  During that time I put 37000 miles on it,and, found it to be an extremely good, reliable vehicle.

Having taken a number of long trips in this car, I found the seats to be very comfortable when driving for long periods of time.  The car's handling with the base suspension and wheels was very acceptable, and, compares well with the competition in this class of vehicle.  Brake performance was also good,and, the brakes never exhibited any fading problems when I took the car on the mountain roads in my area.

The performance of the 2.7L V-6 is generally acceptable running at interstate speeds.  However, with the weight of this car, take-off is a bit slow, and, the transmission must downshift frequently to maintain speed on mountain, back country roads.  However, during my period of ownership of this vehicle, it never got under 30 MPG, very good for this size vehicle.

During my period of ownership, I found reliability and quality to be acceptable.  The only problem with the vehicle of any significance was a sensor failure that caused a very rough running engine.  The local Dodge dealer quickly found the problem and replaced the defective sensor under warranty.

I found that, when I recently traded this vehicle in, that it had held its resale value reasonably well.
