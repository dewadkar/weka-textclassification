            I got my little Cougar for a birthday present. It is a flashy lazer red. I have enjoyed driving it very much! It handles well on the road, and is quiet comfortable for long drives. The stereo system is nice, except the cd changer is loaded in the back of the car. I have plenty of room in the hatch, but it is not for back seat riders.
  It has plenty of get up and go! An older gentleman was looking at it one day, and said &quot; I thought that was one of those fancy European cars&quot;.
  The little car is sleek, and very much a looker!
  Everything is within reach while driving, and you feel in control. However I would not recommend it for anyone with children, due to the tiny back seat.
