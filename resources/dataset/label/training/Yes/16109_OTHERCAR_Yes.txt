            This is the best SUV out in the market for many reasons, but the number one reason to me is the suspension.  This SUV drives like a car, it is unbelievable to think that an SUV could drive like this, but it does.  The model that I have is the Grand Cherokee Limited 2000.  This car basically has every opinion and at a fairly reasonable price.  

Anyone who is interested in a SUV should definitely check out the Jeep Grand Cherokees.  I love everything about this car.  I has leather seats, the power seats, automatic climate control, a 180 watt car stereo, and my particular model is equipped with something called quadra-drive.  Quadra-drive is unbelievable because it adds to the smoothness of the ride.  Basically, it makes it so that each wheel operates independently of any other wheel.  What this means is that if one wheel is spinning, the wheel on the other side won't be spinning either.  This is great for off-road or for snowy travel because this car with quadra-drive will be able to get you where you want to go if at least one wheel has traction.  This is due to the fact that the car knows to focus the engine torque towards the wheels that do have traction in order to get the vehicle moving.  In addition, I have the V8 engine which is a must.  This SUV has unbelievable pickup with this V8 engine and in order to receive the full experience of this car the V8 is necessary, but not required.

The only negative part of this car is the gas mileage.  The mileage is between 16 and 20 miles per gallon depending on city or highway mileage.  Unfortunately, for all SUV's that is a problem for all of them and no just the jeep.  So if you want an SUV, you must deal with the low gas mileage.

I would recommend this car to anyone who is interested in buying a SUV.  I also would recommend this car to anyone is interested in the slightest because once you drive it, I promise you that you will love it.  Thats what happened to me and I know that it would happen to anyone else who drives this car.
