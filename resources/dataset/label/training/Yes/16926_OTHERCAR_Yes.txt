            We were looking to trade in our 90 Jeep Cherokee, and stumbled on the local Subaru lot.  We live in the mountains of North Carolina, so we were looking for something that could get us around in any type of weather.  My husband drives an average of 100 miles a day, so we were looking for something reliable and comfortable (especially since he is 6'5&quot;).  The wagon can handle paved and unpaved mountain roads.  We recently got our first taste of winter and it didn't let us down.  I would recommend this car to a single person to a family of four, if you have a larger family this car is not for you.  The split rear seats are wonderful.  You can still have a passenger in the back and carry cargo.  I think that the Subaru is roomier that the Cherokee and definitely gets better gas mileage.  It is perfect for someone that would like the space, but is not looking for a minivan.<br><br>
