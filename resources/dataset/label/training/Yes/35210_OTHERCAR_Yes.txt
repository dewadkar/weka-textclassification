                 Whether you're high in the Rockies or in the heart of the city, 4Runner's interior will keep you in luxurious surroundings. With comfortably contoured seats and thoughtful amenities such as easy-to-use dial-type ventilation controls, a storage bin under the armrest, a power-operated rear window and several cup holders, the 4Runner makes an accommodating escort ï¿½ even through inhospitable places.
   As jagged rock and gentle foliage balance beautifully in nature, 4Runner, too, is a harmonious blend of ruggedness and refinement. Strong lines span its brawny stance while tasteful details and a deep, lustrous finish add sophistication and civility. The 2000 4Runner is a thoroughly considered and uniquely crafted sport utility vehicle offering an array of standard and available features.
     When far from civilization, what is dependability worth? Can one put a value on peace of mind? As you can see from the numbers below, the 4Runner is competitively priced. But when the benefits of Toyota quality are factored in, 4Runner's real value becomes clear.
