            If you are considering which mini-van to purchase, stop your debate and order a Honda Odyssey!  We traded in our Nissan Quest two months ago for our new 2000 Honda Odyssey and we absolutely love it.

We were very lucky to find one with a Navigation system and all the extras, just before we moved from California to Maryland.  The navigation system is a godsend.  As long as you live in a Metropolitan area and the navigation system has your area in it's system, we highly recommend it.  We have used it EVERY day, even when we know exactly where we are going.  Although it is not totally accurate (what system could be these days with the growth of new shopping centers and roads every day), it will ALWAYS get you where you are going, with easy directions, voice prompts, and user-friendly graphics.  ((According to the manual, new DVDs will be available each fall for those with the navigational systems for updates.))

We have already put nearly 6,000 miles on our vehicle and have had no problems WHATSOEVER.  At first we noticed the 'thump' of the fuel in the fuel tank when it is full, but now do not notice it at all.  The ride is great and it is a pleasure to drive.  Also, the magic third seat is brilliant.  We travelled with our dog in a large kennel and with all of our luggage, I could still see out of the entire rear window while driving.  In short, we simply love our Odyssey!<br><br>
