            My husband bought me the C200 for Christmas, and it was a wonderful surprise.  I had been itching for a digital camera for quite some time, and my wish came true.  I have two beautiful kids, and I always take tons of pictures.  Having a digital camera solves the problem of what to do with all the pictures.

I love the fact that I can view the pictures as soon as I take them, and discard them if they don't turn out as planned.  The self timer is great because I can take pictures of my family with myself included.  It makes it really nice to be able to post pictures of my family on the website as soon as they are taken, rather than having to wait for them to be developed, and then get around to scanning them.

The camera doesn't drain batteries as quickly as I expected either.  I would much rather buy batteries than film anyway.  All the added features, such as the 2X zoom, red eye reducer, and autofocus really make it easy for a novice photographer like me to get the perfect shot every time!<br><br>
