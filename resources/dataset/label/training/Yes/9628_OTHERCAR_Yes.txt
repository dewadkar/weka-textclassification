            Before you get in a hissy fit about my title hear me out, the not so pleasant surprise about this tracker was that it could take on any small suv on the road. That was unpleasant for the other buyers, not me, I have had this thing flying 15 feet in the air, over whoops that cause it to bottom the suspension repeatedly with 4 adults in the vehicle. We have not broken a single thing on this little beast(with the exception of a mirror being popped out from a friends careless driving into a tree). My friends nor I, nor GM can believe the punishment that we have put this suv through. They never intended for it to carry 4 adults while catching 10 feet of air over solid sand dunes, or to climb 60 degree soft sand hills again with 4 adults. But we have done this and more, all the while getting gas mileage that makes a honda civic blush. It now has 160,000km on it and is in need of a tuneup, it's not running quite as well as new but it still purrs like a kitten. But it can scream if it needs to, that 1.6L has beaten many a 5.0 mustangs off the line. Sure that's because it goes through all 5 gears below 120km/h, but it still rocks their world when I get the front wheels off the ground taking off from a stop light. It's in need of some new tires now, I'm thinking something with a little more tread than the stock goodyear wranglers. Maybe I'll challenge a little mud then too, rock climbing could be fun......

What you people have to realize about this vehicle is that it's not made to be driven on the highway, if it was then it wouldn't be geared to run at 4000rpm at highway speeds. Use it for what it was really intended and you'll love every minute of it! I guarantee it!
