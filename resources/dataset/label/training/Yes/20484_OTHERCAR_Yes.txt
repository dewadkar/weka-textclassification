            Well, after looking and driving every sports car on the market, I made my choice, Eclipse. I was going from my 2000 Celica GT, which I love! But I couldn't ignore current interest rates--time for a new car! :)  I honestly can't express how shocked I was when I drove the Eclipse. The engine and ride were so much more refined than I had expected. So much so that the only way I can really explain then is by saying, expensive-feeling.  

The interior has also seen a face-lift, which I love. This car has gone through some major changes from its last generation version. Two things though. You REALLY want (at least) the GT version for the V6 engine. If you can afford it, get it.  Also, 17" Wheels. They really make the car look a lot nicer and the feel on the road with them, well, you feel very secure.  Mine also had the sunroof which I just love! :) To me, the Eclipse looks very good coming AND going. The rear brake lights have the cool "Euro" look--but somehow, it's not overdone like I've seen in some of the aftermarket stuff...looks classy.  

The only negative things are little things, that I took for granted on my Celica. Alarm--I thought just about every car in this price range came with some form of an Alarm. Usually when you have Keyless Entry, it's a no brainer.  But the Eclipse didn't have one--and my Eclipse was right at $24,000, before tax. You can get one, surely it comes standard on the GT-S, but I really expected it for what I paid. Also, my Celica had the sensor that turns the lights on and off. Just a little thing, but it sure was nice. Also, the fog lights--you have to turn them on, everytime you get in the car (if you want them on, that is :) ). The button doesn't remember when you've cut the car off. Again, just a little thing, but kind of a little pain.  

Either Way, these are small prices for such a nice car. Going from my Celica GT to this 2003 Eclipse GT, I really fell like I've gone to a much nicer and better feeling car. The ride is MUCH nicer and I have more power. The overall look, inside and out, makes me feel like I've made a nice step up, not a huge one.  

Also, comments from friends seem to be of shock. They are all amazed by how nice the car is. Most people seem to be excited by how much the car has changed and they didn't realize it. Other notable things include the engine. Every single person who has been in the car has commented on how nice the engine sounds--and I agree! :)  It's very smooth and doesn't give the impression that you're really working it hard at all--like it's kind of laughing at you. Also, everyone seems to like the seats and interior room. It makes you even more excited when you see people react in such positive ways. Very cool. :)
