            I bought this 4 door sedan in 1995 for my wife from a car dealer's new stock. The dealer had ordered a lot of good options with this car. Like air conditioning, power steering, automatic transmission and car mats. I enjoy driving it and for a smaller car it handles very well in many driving conditions. Great in the snow! 

This sedan has a large trunk, we packed it full and went on vacation all along the eastern U.S. coast. Gets great gas mileage - no need to line-up at the busy self serves on the interstates, you can drive up to the full service without worrying too much about the cost of fuel. 

In front, side and rear crash tests, this Metro model has done well. 

If you do your own maintenance, its pretty easy working on this car. Oil/filter changes are a breeze to do, you don't even have to jack-up the car to reach the drain plug and filter. Tune-ups are quick and easy, spark plugs, cap/rotor and wires are easy to reach and change.

The 1.3 liter, four cylinder overhead cam Suzuki engine produces 70 hp, pollutes very little...passes government clean air tests with flying colors. 

The original manufacturer's brakes tend to wear out faster and are noisier than third party heavy duty brakes. 

I'm 6ft. tall and the 4 door sedan has a lot of head room in the front. It's ok in the rear seats. 

I own three cars including this one. This car has become our "Family Car".
