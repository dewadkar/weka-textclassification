            I work in sales and spend alot of time on the road with clients. I purchased the Concorde Lxi fully loaded because it portrays the image I need in front of my clients while remaining cost effective as well.

I love this car and everything about it form its quiet and powerful 3.2L engine to it huge cabin space. They Infinity Sound System is wonderful and all the extras that come with the car a handy.  I drive about 40,000 miles a year and the cockpit is set up in a very driver friendly format. All of the instruments are easily accessible when needed.

I have found that driving this car has made driving fun again. As you can imagine, driving so many miles can be tedious at best, but the Concorde makes every mile enjoyable, Except for Boston rush hour traffic but what can you do about that?

I would recommend as a great vehicle for professionals and family types. The roomy cabin is great for kids, I can comfortably get my two car seats plus an adult in the back seat. This is a true value for the money
