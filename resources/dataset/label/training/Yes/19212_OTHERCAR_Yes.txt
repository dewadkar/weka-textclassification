            2002 GMC Yukon Denali XL 
The world's premier luxury SUV. 

                        In the world of luxury sport utilities, there are a broad range of
                        offerings. The executive Navigator, the stately Range Rover, the
                        sporty ML. But do they really offer the utility and practicality or
                        the rugged good looks of the Denali XL, whose luxury more than
                        keeps up with its competitors? Maybe not. 

                        Exterior: 9.5/10 

                        Though the Denali XL has relatively distinctive looks, there
                        could've been more to tell them apart from the stock Yukon. The
                        Denali boasts very attractive five-spoke 17" polished alloys on
                        massive Michelin CrossTerrains, a shiny metal grille,
                        reflector-beam headlamps, a custom chrome fan-shaped exhaust
                        pipe, Denali badging on the passenger and driver doors, and some
                        different, muscular-looking "lines" on the body. Though the
                        Denali's main competition, the Navigator, is more distinctive, the
                        Denali is better looking overall. The Denali has very clean styling
                        that doesn't use mass amounts of body-side cladding or any other
                        ridiculous over-doings. The running boards are nice-looking and
                        make entry and exit a breeze. Overall, the Denali looks
                        intimidating, tough, and handsome. 
                        ***New for 2002: Boo-yah 17"5-spoke chrome rims, we've been good boys/girls this year***

                        Utility: 10/10 (there's a lot of it) 

                        No detail was left out in making this the most useful and practical
                        vehicle on the planet. There is a hiding-place or cupholder for
                        everyone in the vehicle, things that fold up or pop open, and
                        generally one would get the idea that this vehicle would be fun to
                        be in for a long road trip. In the cargo area, there is a handy and
                        easy-to-use cargo cover and a cargo net, plus a floor mat and
                        plenty of carpet. The cargo area, with the cover up, is easily large
                        enough to hold a person! A power point and auxiliary door lock
                        controls are also present. The 3rd row seat is a fixed 3-person
                        bench, that with the click of two buttons pops out and can be
                        removed, or folded flat. 3rd row passengers get storage nooks and
                        cupholders. The 2nd row passengers are truly lucky. They have a
                        60/40 split folding bench, where the outboard passengers's
                        cushions can be heated with a press of a button. The 40 portion
                        can slide and tilt forward to allow relatively easy entry to the 3rd
                        row. In the middle portion of the 2nd row is a fold out tray with
                        dual cupholders and storage. In front of the 2nd row, on the back
                        side of the front center console, is another nifty set of fold-down
                        cupholders, dual power points, the excellent rear seat heat
                        controls, and controls for the audio system, replete with
                        headphone jacks, volume, and media controls. In the front, there
                        is a massive lockable center console that, with a press of a
                        button, pops open the bottom half to store coins and CD's, and
                        yet another power point. Pressing another button causes a
                        "writing table"-like thing to pop up and reveal further storage.
                        Giving a light touch to the panels in front of the consoles reveals
                        more dual cupholders and an ashtray, and another power point.
                        Finally, there is a massive glove compartment. 

                        Interior and comforts: 9.5/10 

                        When you enter the interior, you are quickly informed that this
                        was not a cheap vehicle, by the intoxicating scent of aromatic
                        Nuance leather. Oh, and speaking of leather, there's a lot of it. All
                        three rows are almost entirely covered with buttery-soft leather,
                        with very little vinyl in sight. Even the nifty contoured headrests,
                        the armrests, and the console is covered in Nuance leather. In the
                        few places there are vinyl, such as the seatbacks, it's relatively
                        well concealed. The plastic on the dashboard is solidly
                        constructed and has a high-quality feel. The seats in all the rows
                        provide good lumbar and lateral support, and there is mass
                        amounts of hiproom, even in the 3rd row. I was impressed by the
                        fact that all of the seating positions were comfortableï¿½this is a
                        true 8-passenger vehicle, not a 6-passenger vehicle with 2 more
                        crammed in. Legroom is impressive also, about 41/39/36. These
                        seats are well padded, and feature an attractive stitch pattern as
                        well as two-toned leather. The rear seat heaters are a definite
                        selling point. Up front, there is dual-zone heating on the bucket
                        seats. These bucket seats in front offer a whopping 12-ways to
                        adjust them, including 6-way cushion control, 2-way backrest
                        control, 2-way lumbar support, and even 2-way side bolsters
                        (frivolous, but cool!). The drivers seat has a handy memory
                        system also. The fake dark cherry wood trim looks real, but
                        touching it reveals its plastic heritage. For 48 grand, they could've
                        given us a little real wood, *cough* Navigator has real walnut trim
                        *cough*. Thank God they didn't overuse the wood trim. The
                        OnStar system is helpful, and with the purchase of the Premium
                        Package, the folks at Onstar can do everything from giving you
                        directions and ordering pizza, to getting you email and stock
                        quotes, to hands-free calling. As for the radio and climate
                        controls, I'll describe them later, but the ergonomics are fantastic
                        in this vehicle, with everything in reach of the driver. It is a
                        pleasure to be in the Denali, in any of its seats. 

                        Climate controls: 10/10 

                        The climate controls are well laid out, and get to work fast. 10
                        adjustable air vents throughout the vehicle, controlled
                        thermostatically for front and back, do this work. In the front, there
                        is front climate controls with rear climate controls on the ceiling,
                        as well as a second set of rear climate controls further back on
                        the ceiling for the 2nd row to adjust. The whole system is efficient,
                        effective, and easy to use. 

                        Radio: 10/10 

                        You have to love Bose. I mean, what other SUV (besides that
                        darn Range Rover) offers eleven speakers custom-engineered and
                        tuned for the vehicle? The sound that comes from the
                        AM/FM/Cassette/Autochanger is audiophile quality and offers 250
                        watts of power. The controls are quite simple, and the rear audio
                        controls are a godsend.  Hefty 6" speaks in the doors, a multitude of creatively placed
                        tweeters, and some burly RichBass subwoofer action in the rear left panel make for some
                        disgracefully loud, rich detailed sound that's an experience for all 8 riders.

                        The Ride: 9.5/10 

                        Little betrays to the passengers, that this is a truck that they are
                        riding in, such is the quality. The Autoride suspension neutralizes
                        the bumps. Insane amounts of sound insulation cancels out all
                        noise, giving a cloud-like ride. The ride is quite soft and
                        comfort-tuned; if you want off-road prowess go for the Z71 Tahoe. A speedbump at high
                        speeds will give you a quick and horrible reminder that this is indeed a truck.  Other than 
                        that, it rides like a Caddy (only with better handing :-).


                        The Handling: 9.5/10 

                        No slipping and sliding here, folks. The AWD system is excellent
                        and great for all types of weather and driving conditions. The tires
                        are top-notch and despite this vehicle's mammoth dimension, the
                        turning circle is pretty tight. The truck feels secure and not tippy.  Amazingly it whips through
                        corners with elan and a definite feeling of security, I was impressed to say the least.

                        Powertrain: 10/10 

                        The 6.0L Vortec churns out a whopping 320 horses and 365
                        pound-feet of torque, giving plenty of motivation to this 5800 pound
                        beast. Acceleration is swift and power is plentiful. Another nail in
                        the Navigator's coffin.  Off the line power is impressive and lane changes are                         instantaneous.

                        Gas Mileage: 4/10 

                        Definitely not for the faint of heart. Only the truly brave dare press
                        the fuel button on the trip computer; when I did, it read 8.5 mpg.
                        Hopefully this truck can do better than that at other times. For
                        this reason, it's not too smart to use this vehicle for all trips large
                        or small, or if you live in a hilly area. Translation: you're going to
                        be filling that 32.5 gallon fuel tank very frequently.  However, once the truck is broken in
                        I've seen it get about 13 or 14 mpg, pretty decent

                        Overall Value: 9/10 

                        The Denali offers quite a bit more than the normal Yukon, but at a
                        very high price. But compared to the competition, it's a pretty
                        good deal. And it doesn't look like the mafioso Nav ;-)
