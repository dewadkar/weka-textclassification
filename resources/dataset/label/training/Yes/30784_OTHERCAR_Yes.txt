            I always do a lot of research before I buy anything, anymore.  We're talking weeks worth, on the internet, in stores, reading reviews and so on.  I needed a digital camera because my scanner died and I need to get pictures on the web for my business.  Honestly?  I hate having to wait to get them developed also so this worked out for the best.

I don't use all the features of the camera.  In fact I probably use only the very basic ones but that's really all I need.  I pretty much just click and shoot a picture, take it to the computer and download it.
For those very basic things it's been just great. 

I like that I can see the pictures as I'm taking them and scroll through them to see if I took a bad one.  The camera takes great pictures, the person pushing the button (me)needs a lot of help. I take this camera everywhere with me and put the pictures up on web pages or send through the email.  

I bought the camera on sale at Best Buy for $300.00 and it came with an 8mb card and I got a 16mb card free.  I haven't opened the extra card yet.  I picked this camera over a Kodak and I think a Vivitar.  
My friends that use it keep asking how many more pictures they can take on it, but it's displayed on the camera and it's almost 200 pictures.  They're still used to having to change film.  

I'm sure that if I dug out my book and read up on all the features I would love this camera even more.  The camera is easy to use and the instruction booklet easy to follow. 

One bad thing. It eats up batteries like crazy.  I finally decided to buy a battery recharger and keep 3 sets of batteries on hand at a time for it.  Now the camera and I get along just fine.
