            This car keeps on going, and going, and going...I purchased my 93 Escort at the end of the 93 Model Year.  My 87 Nissan was falling apart and I was desperate.  I didn't have the money at the time, but the price, first-time buyer incentive, and factory rebates sold me.  I couldn't pass up this deal! With all the incentives, rebates, and my trade in, I paid 7500.00--NEW!  It's not exactly what I had in mind, but am in no way sorry I made this purchase.  

This vehicle is 7 years old, has 115,000 miles on it, and has never failed me.  People have commented on how quiet it is when running.  I still get 38 miles to the gallon (highway). It handles beautifully.  This car has sat outside for 7 years through rain, sun, and Wisconsin winters and has no rust on it.  Maintenance has been next to nothing, except for tires, mufflers, and oil changes!  

I purchased a 4-door, because at the end of the model year, I didn't have much choice.  The only drawback to this vehicle is that it is small.  It is a smooth ride for such a small car, and there is a bit of road noise.  This car is perfect for the single person.  Anyone who is tall though, may be uncomfortable and the back seat doesn't seat 3 very comfortably.  However, though small, I have moved loads of stuff in this little gem!  I can get into and out of little spaces and the turning radius is awesome!  <br><br>
