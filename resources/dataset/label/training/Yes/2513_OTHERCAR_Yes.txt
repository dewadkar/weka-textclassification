            I had been having some major car problems in my life...I was 20 years old and had already had 7 cars and had to get rid of them for various reasons.  All of a sudden one day when I was looking for cars (mainly Jeeps) I drove by a dealership that had this, shall I say "cute" truck for sale.  I test drove it and fell in love with it...I asked as many people as I could about my descion to get the Toyota..I finally made up my mind and went on instinct.  

Best choice of my young life.....

This is just too reliable of a truck, I just love it.  It has never left me stranded or had any major melt-downs.  I recently had the shocks replaced (they were the original shocks) and tires and it will soon need a front brake job, but that stuff is just maintenance.  The 22-RE engine produces 116 HP on the 4 cylinder which could be a major turnoff for some, but it is very peppy around town and is just fine for me.  A main reason why I bought the pickup was because it has 4WD.  This past winter was a bear in New England and is works great.  It was very easy to shift and operate.  I had an old Toyota Cressida which lasted me to 190,000 miles with the original transmission as well, and I didn't do an oil change for about 10,000 miles, but that was before I knew any better. My point is, it says a lot about the engines that Toyota puts out.  I expext <b>at least</b> 200,000 miles out of mine and don't see why I should expect anything less.  This car still has original brake rotors and the muffler.

There are some quirks about the Toyota Pickup, like if you get the base model like I did, there is no trip odometer, clock, no power and you get one of those uncomfortable bench seats, but it is fine and dandy with me.  Those inconveinces dont out way the excellent gas mileage (18-22MPG) and reliablity that I get with my truck.
