            I purchased a 4-dr LS Legend in 1994 and just recently sold it after getting into an accident with the vehicle.  I would say that the Legend is one of the finest vehicles I've had the privilege of driving at the price range that I got it for (mid-teens).  The power from the 2.7L V-6 is not very torquey but it provides enough power to zip around on the roads and gives an easy and smooth acceleration that one cannot find in a car in it's price range.  Since it has it's roots in Honda, it has the Honda reliability with a practical luxury feel to it.  Small things made the car much more enjoyable like the temperature regulator and the radio controls near the steering wheel.  One complaint I had of the car was that the turn radius is actually not as small as other cars of it's size and there are definite lack of cupholders.  It is also common to see the radio antenna not working at this point in time.  These are relatively small problems and complaints about the car though.
The handling of the car is very comfortable.  The steering wheel seems to have extra power steering applied to it and one can make a turn fairly effortlessly.  The power from the accelerator kicks in nicely in response to your needs (automatic only) and the acceleration is smooth and quick.  The body is not as rigid as you'd like it to be at times with the acceleration and the power that you are given on turns but the overall drive is very enjoyable. . .especially for long road trips.
  I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a quality vehicle at an acceptable price range.  It is definitely a good older family car because of the power and the good room in the back and the front.  It does not come with passenger air bags though but all other saftey features are available with it.<br><br>
