                I had been wanting my first Mercedes-Benz for many years, I was going to wait until the 2001 New C-Class came out.  The Special Edition of the C-280 for model year 2000 was too good to pass up.
    For one price ($1,600.00) I got all the options I wanted on the car, a total of $5,500.00 dollars worth of options, what a deal.
    This package included the Sport/handling suspension, glass sunroof, two-tone leather power sport seats, 6-disk CD changer, Digital StarTac phone, Silver metallic paint, split-fold-down rear seats, chrome door splash plates and custom floor mats.
     A lot of nice items on a already nicely equipped car.  The only other option I got was heated seats.  Out the door for $37,000, not the $42,000 I thought I would spend.
    With the sport suspension, this car handles very nicely, much firmer then the regular C-Class, I smile every time I drive this car.
    I would have liked a bit larger interior, which the new 2001 has, but for my needs it is perfect.
    Anyone who enjoys driving, without the Boy-Racer look of lesser cars would love this Mercedes.
    The resale value, image, quality of parts, great dealer support and  the rock solid feel of this car makes it worth the money.  It might not be the fastest car on the road, or the roomiest, but nothing is like a Mercedes-Benz.<br><br>
