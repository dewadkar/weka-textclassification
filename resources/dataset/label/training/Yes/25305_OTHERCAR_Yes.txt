            So you want to take good pictures without spending your kids college savings? Well, here you go. In a word: Clear. That's right folks, this camera takes crystal clear pictures and has some very nice zoom features. Now please remember, this is not a camera that costs you much over 200, so you are not going to be able to take all sorts of zoom pictures. You dont get the full range of the more expensive cameras, but for a normal person's needs, this should suffice very well. For indoor and outdoors, this piece of photographic equipment works very well. The flash is nice for its price, and the button options are decent as well. So, in a nutshell: an affordable, decent camera. <br><br>
