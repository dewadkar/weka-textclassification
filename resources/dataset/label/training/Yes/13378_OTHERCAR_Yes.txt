            My 1993 Chevy Cavalier was my first car.  I spent a lot of time looking for a car that was inexpensive and still looked nice.  I found my teal/green Chevy at a small dealer in my town.  I paid five grand for it.  It had a sunroof, and I was absolutely thrilled about that.  It only had two doors, which at my age, was great too.  It made the car look less like a &quot;family car&quot; and more like a car for someone my age.

I must admit that when I bought the car the head gasket was cracked, but we got it right back to the dealer and he fixed it without question.  The thing I loved the most about my Cavalier was the excellent gas mileage I got from.  I only went though a quarter of a tank per week.  I worked every day and made trips to places too.  If I went far away, I went through more than a quarter of a tank, but I still got great miles on it.

I had very little maintenance in my car for the first year.  It passed inspection the first year and didn't give me one ounce of trouble.  It was a very nice, little, and reliable car.  It was rather comfortable to ride in up front, but the back seat didn't have that much room for an adult to sit comfortably.

The problems started happening right around the time I hit 80,000 miles.  My brakes went out, but that's a normal wear and tear problem.  What wasn't normal was the fact that if I drove the car over forty five miles an hour it would shake.  The entire car would shake like crazy and it scared me half to death.  I took it to the shop several times.  I had new rotors put on and that didn't help.  They checked the alignment and who knows what else.  I spent over $500.00 trying to get the car fixed when I finally gave up on it and bought something else.

I don't know if it's normal for these cars to just &quot;die&quot; after they hit so many miles. I've heard other stories of it, but it could be just coincidence.  I would recommend this kind of car for someone who isn't looking for something too fancy. It's great for someone who travels a lot and wants to get a car that gets good gas mileage.  For the price, it's great for someone just starting out.  I would just be careful with them because of the high mileage you'd find on them now.  <br><br>
