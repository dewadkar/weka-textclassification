            Looking for a sports sedan in Nashville with a manual transmission proved to be a challenging experience; initial focus was squarely on a BMW 3-series, a car favored by many magazines and reviews.  Wanted to spend as close to $25K as possible, I drove a 2000 BMW 323 - a tight car but surprisingly lacking in power.  

Wanting to broaden our horizons, we visited the Audi dealership to look at a pre-owned A4 - while the A4 was too small, the A6 appeared as an interesting candidate.  My only concern was the salesperson stated that it didn't come with a manual - luckily my internet research pointed me to a 2001 model (fire engine red) with the manual 6-speed.  After one drive, I knew this was a serious contender.  After putting two car seats in the back, we quickly realized the tightness of the 3-series wasn't just in performance but also room!  For the money and performance, the A6 proved the winner - here is my review:

Never thinking I would own a red Audi, the color has proven to be an eye catcher - I've fitted the car with HRE Performaance wheels for a very aggressive look.  Performance of the vehicle is excellent:

Straight line performance - turbo lag is minimal; besides the quiet whine of the turbo's (I actually enjoy the sound), the engine pulls quickly - the 6-spd allows you to manage the lag very well.  Accereleration is extremely strong - especially in 3rd thru 5th (6th being the cruiser) - you can drop it into 5th going 75 and actually be pressed into your seat.

Handling - handling is tight in the corners with the sports suspension - I didn't drive the "regular" A6 but a friend described it as mushy.  My only con comes into play when it comes to the steering feel - while the car corners very well, the power assist is so strong it takes away a bit of the true feel of the car.  

Interior - classic german quality and feel - roominess is abound in the rear.  Bose radio brings out excellent sound from the various Dead CD's favored for the commute.  

I would highly recommend this vehicle as a unique alternative as a sports sedan - I never compared the actual performance figures but they have to rank very high (I did see a 0-60 time of 6 seconds flat for the manual).  For the same price as a '01 BMW 3-series, I purchased a much higher performing sports sedan, equipped with all-wheel drive, and a much roomier interior.
