             This was my second digital camera. I am grateful I learned on a simpler model and when we gave it to my college daughter for school, I was ready to upgrade.

 We examined all models of digitals and were very impressed with the Sony. We have used Sony products in the past and have been very satisfied. The main reason I chose this camera was to have the advantage of using 3.5 floppy discs and having the ability to take more pictures at a time without having to download to the computer. 

 I also like the feature of using a lithium, rechargeable battery that lasts much longer than the AA batteries I had been using.
 The user manual is very well written and easy to use and follow. The very first picture I took came out of the printer looking like a professional photograph. It was a thrill.

 There are many accessory options available which give future gift givers ideas!

 I plan to use the camera for personal use, but I can see that it would be a valuable asset to a builder, art student, real estate broker for advertising or a very proud grandmother of ten and mother of six daughters as I am! I highly recommend this camera!<br><br>
