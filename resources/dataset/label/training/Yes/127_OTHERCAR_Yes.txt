            As a beginner to the digital camera world I must say so far I have had wonderful luck with this model.. I of course use the pictures to send to friends on the Internet, and keep them stored on my hard drive, instead of having pictures all over my house.

The quality of the images has been excellent, 
the only bad ones were due to an error on my part and those I am able to trash. 
                    
WEAKNESS in this model is that it &quot;eats&quot; batteries (although from what I hear all the models do that). 

I do like the fact that with the MX-1200 model the batteries it uses are AA. 

When downloading to the PC from the camera it didn't seem overly long, but since this is my first digital camera experience I don't know how long it usually takes. I did order a floppy disk that you insert the smart card in to download the pictures. I&quot;m hoping this will increase the life of my batteries and speedup downloading a bit.       
                    
 So for the price I would have to say it's an outstanding digital camera for it's value and it's loaded with great features  here to name a few:                  
   1) Outstanding image quality 
   2) Extensive picture-taking controls
   3) A very compact camera 
   4) Available at relatively low cost 
   5) Useful software supplied with the camera
