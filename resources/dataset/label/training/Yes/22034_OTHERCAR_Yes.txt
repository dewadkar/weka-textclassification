            Design Features. 
Depending on the model you are looking at (GXE, SE, GLE) you will see a similarity in options and features. First off, the GXE is the lowest model Maxima, always has been. SE is middle of the road, and GLE is the monster, all the options. One Design feature that I could go without is the motorized seatbelts. A stupid feature that should have been left out. But during the mid 90's it was motorized seatbelt fever, and I guess Nissan needed to jump on the bandwagon. Needless to say, the Maxima has everything a luxury 4 door sedan should have. Power Seats/Windows/Moonroof/Locks. Side mirror defrosters !! My Lexus doesnï¿½t even have that !! Air bags, a nicely placed clock, overdrive, and a sporty V6 engine. 

Exterior Body. 
The body of this car is sleek and compact. (Nissan's evolution from the Boxy 1980's version to the 2000 streamlined horsepower machine) This car is in style, still !! Not to say very desirable. If your one of those teens (like myself) whom likes to tweak the car until its crying and begging for stock parts, this car is not for you. I had so much trouble finding racing and performance parts I just gave up. For the classy executive, or even the house mommy, this car is great. Gas Mileage is all right, but nothing to rant about. 

Mechanical. 
As for as under the hood maintenance, this car was in the shop seldom, if at all. During the mid 90's Nissan was using quality parts (they still are). I have seen Maxima's with 250000+ miles, and they look and ride great. I am currently a Maxima enthusiast, and I highly recommend anything Nissan. Altima, Maxima, Sentra, all great machines, that perform as well. 

If you would like to see what I have done to my Maxy, you can take a look at my website.
