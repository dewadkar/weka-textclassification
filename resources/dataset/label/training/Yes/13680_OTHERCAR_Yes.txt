            We have a 1995 Trooper which we purchased new, and now has 65,000 miles on it. Lots of room front and rear, lots of cargo space, great fold down split rear seats. Very reliable, which is good because dealer service is very expensive (the 60,000 mile service is nearly $1000). This vehicle has the old style part time 4 wheel drive, which means you have to stop the vehicle to lock the hubs, though once the hubs are locked you can shift in and out of 4wd without stopping.


This is a very heavy vehicle (over 5000 lbs) and it handles like a heavy vehicle. It is very top heavy so you have to take it easy on the corners. However, this is not a car-based SUV nor is it based on a light pickup truck (as the Ford Exploder is), this is a truck with a ladder frame chassis, so it is very rigid, which makes it great for off road use. Yes, this is a real 4WD truck, which makes it great for camping, hauling a boat, and blasting around in snow and mud.


The interior (we have a basic model) is clean and functional, not to say spartan, more like Japanese utilitarian, which is fine for this type of vehicle. There are upmarket versions with leather seats and so forth.


When we purchased this vehicle in 1995 it was a clear winner: the most powerful motor available in a SUV, a good value for the money, and a good functional design. The current models, however, are essentially the same, which is to say that they have not kept up with the competition.


We love our Trooper, it hauls lots of large people, lots of stuff, our dog, our canoe, camping gear. It's the vehicle of choice when it's snowing. But it is a truck, and that has to be respected when you are driving it. And 13mph...ugh.
