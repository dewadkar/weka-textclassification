            I bought this car just over a year ago.  I didn't drive it first and I didn't know anything about it.  In fact, I bought it completely over the phone and just stopped by the dealership to pick it up.  It was a strange thing to do, but I really can't say I regret it.  Obviously nothing about the car it self made me buy it, it was the price I liked.  For just over $12,000 I was getting a brand new car, and I was extremely happy about it!

Not surprisingly, what I got was just over $12,000 worth of car.  It's average in just about every way.  I still say I would recommend it, but I say that because it's a good entry-level car.  It's not loaded down with options, it's not fast, and it won't make you look cool, but it's an inexpensive, reliable, and efficient car.  It gets great gas mileage and other than oil changes, it's never been to a shop for repairs.

I've put about 30,000 miles on it, many of which were in the mountains, and I've never had a single problem with it.  I am very happy with the way it handles, but I wish it had a little more power.  The back seats fold down and open up to the trunk, which has proven useful on many an occasion.

My wife and I just bought a 2001 Jeep Cherokee Limited but we've decided to keep this car.  There's just no good reason for us to get rid of it and spend a bunch of money on another car.

Note to tall people: Forget this car.  Sorry, but it's expensive being tall!  I'm 6'4 and comfort has been my biggest complaint.
