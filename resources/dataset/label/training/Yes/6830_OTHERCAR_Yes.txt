            When we replaced our Civic CRX SI, we needed more room, but we also wanted a four-wheel drive/all wheel drive.  The only vans that offered AWD were Chevys and Dodges, both makes of which we have had HORRIBLE experiences with and have sworn never to buy another.  So, the Subaru Legacy Wagon (regular, not the Outback) was the choice.  We bought it new; 130,000 miles later, here's the skinny:

Body - Great shape, except for the dent in the rear which was not the car's fault.  Everything else, hinges, window seals, door latches etc. is fine.  (Note: We are in the SF Bay Area, where road salt is unheard of.)

Interior - After all this time, it's holding up very nicely.  Carpet is in good shape, seat upholstery fine.  Seats still comfortable, and adjust well.  Rear seats still fold up and down and latch well. NOTE: The location of the cupholder on the dashboard is awful.  If you spill your latte, it goes STRAIGHT into the AM/FM cassette player directly below.  AM/FM cassette players do NOT like lattes, and will stop working to make that point.

Drivetrain - Tranny was making funny noises at 115,000.  Mechanic told me I needed it overhauled.  I just changed the tranny fluid and turned up the radio until the noise stopped about 10,000 miles later.  Everything still works.

Handling - Every since she was new, this has always been good.  That full-time AWD is sweeeeeet, especially during the rainy season when the rain falls like it's 9 months behind schedule and in a hurry to make up time.  Goes well in snow too, when we take it into the mountains. The anti-lock brakes do their job well.

Engine - The little 4 banger gets great gas mileage, but my kid's pedal car has more acceleration.  Engine reliability has been great, except for the electrical stuff. I change the oil about every 7,000 miles.

Electrical - Hoo, boy.  Annoying is the word.  Here's where you find the ghost in the machine.  Twice it's been recalled for faulty sensors in the engine which caused a failure to start. Once it got recalled for an electrical switch problem in the wipers. The gas gauge has gone squirrely - To judge when to fill up I go by the odometer now, rather than the gauge itself.  Then there's the "check engine" light, which has been lit for 60,000 miles or so.  Even the dealer can't fix this.  The engine is perfectly fine, the sensor gets reset, 50 miles later, "blink", on it goes.  I give up.  In talking to other Subie owners, it seems like this is a common thing in older Subarus.
