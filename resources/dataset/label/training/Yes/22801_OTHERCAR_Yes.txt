             This little car may not be a Mercedes or a Cadillac, and it won't go a hundred miles an hour, but it isn't a horrible small car.I have had worse.  It seems to ride smooth and is pretty good on gas. The warranty that is offered by the dealer is phenomenal and will not be beaten by other auto makers.As for the purchase price it may be comparable to others, maybe even less. I think collage kids on a budget would benefit from what to company offers and the economical value of the car..<br><br>
