            Ok my review is of my friends car.  We took a weekend trip up to Indiana and I did some of the driving.  I was quite surprised at how this Hyundai drove.  I will just summarize the main points.  By the way this is a 2000 Hyundai Accent GS Hatchback with automatic.

Drive/Ride:  This thing is silky smooth.  It had no creaks or rattles (surprising as it had 46,000 miles on it) and had very minimal road noise.  The suspension didnt feel overly soft nor overly hard,  just perfect.  It was a real change from my Acura Integra,  the ride was Mercedes like compared to my Integra.  The steering was accurate and had the right assist.

Engine:  The engine could use some refinement.  It got very buzzy and loud above 3500rpm.  But it had good torque down low (again compared to my integra) but the high end had nothing.  Its good for around town and stop and go driving,  but dont expect to much trying to merge onto a freeway.  

Transmission:  Her car is a 4spd automatic.  The shifts were crisp and happened at the perfect times.  It was alittle slow to downshift though when trying to pass.  

Quality:  This is where this car excels.  It had absolutly no squeaks or rattles.  The doors closed with a nice solid thunk.  My friend says the only problem she had with the car was the drivers window.  When its down its hard to close,  you really have to use alot of force to roll it up.  Other then that everything has been good I guess.

Comfort:  The seats were very soft and didnt offer much support.  They were just adequate.  

Final:  This was my first time in her car.  Before I would always look at her car and say "Its a Hyundai,  it must be a piece of junk.".  But now its the Hyundai thats having the last laugh.  I will say I was extremely surprised with that car.  It is so refined compared to my Acura not to mention cheap.  So in closing I will say I will never have doubts about a Hyundai again.
