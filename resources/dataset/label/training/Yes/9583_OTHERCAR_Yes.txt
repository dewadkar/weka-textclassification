            I bought my 2000 Celica GT after a week of internet reviews, research, and comparing it to other cars in its price range, including the GTS. It's a 5 speed - and I've driven an automatic ALL OF MY DRIVING LIFE.  I test drove both the GT and the GTS.  Do yourself a favor and drive both (more than once).  The 180 hp only kicks in the GTS after 6800rpms - that's near redline!  Unless you plan on driving that fast on a regular basis, go with the GT. Save yourself the 4000+ dollar difference. It even feels more powerful than the GTS in the lower gears. I drive in city traffic so I'm in the low gears most of the time.  

I used to hate driving. Now I volunteer. My carbon blue Celica is fully loaded and comfortable. The handling is tight.  Sometimes I have to control my urge to take those curvy off ramps at 50 mph. The a/c, heat, and CD player run great.  The daytime running lights automatically switch to night when it gets dark outside. Very convenient.  The keyless entry is very cool- unless you're too smooth for your own good and accidentally hit the panic button, alerting the whole parking lot that the car alarm works.  Not that it's ever happened to me :).

Toyota makes a dependable car. I'm extremely happy with the GT.  Research the dozens of comparisons between the GT and GTS before you buy.  After reading about this great car on EPINIONS, you might want to check out Car &amp; Driver, Edmunds, and MSNcarpoint.  You'll see that even the pros like this baby.  I think you'll find that the GT is your best bet for performance and money.  You'll have to excuse me now... I'm in the mood for a drive!
