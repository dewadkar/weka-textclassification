            I bought the Canon 450Z after looking at a number of different models. It was my first digital camera and I wanted to make sure that it had the features wanted, wasn't too big, and was priced reasonably. 

The camera had to be able to download pictures easily to my computer, have a zoom built in, have auto focus, and be able to be carried on trips without much hassle. 

A lot of the cameras I was looking at had digital zoom instead of optical zoom. As a novice, I initially thought is was all the same. After doing further research I realized that the picture quality diminished quickly when using the digital zoom, whereas the clarity was maintained when using the optical zoom. Despite the sister camera, 340R, had a lower price tag, I went all out to get the 450Z thanks to the zoom. I have been very happy with this feature, especially when I am a little farther from the object I am photographing (basketball games, landscapes, nature pictures, etc.). 

Although I have worked on computers a fair amount I still had a bit of anxiety associated with downloading the pictures to my computer. I decided to try two different methods. The first way was pretty simple and pretty standard. Once you have installed the software included with the camera, you can plug in the camera in the back of your computer (the name of the type of plug is escaping me) and have a pretty stable transfer. The only problem is the speed. Typically I would watch a TV show or so and the transfers would be done. 

The slow transfer speed did bug me a bit so I decided to see what other options for transferring files were available. I bought a device that sticks into a laptops PCMCIA card slot (it's the same one that you stick your modem into on a laptop). Taking the memory card out of the camera, you insert it into the PCMCIA card and stick the card into the slot in your laptop. The transfer occurs in a fraction of the time. It feels almost instantaneous. When I was snapping a lot of pictures this was a really handy device. 

The other thing that was a key point was the number of pictures you could store on the camera. It varies based on the memory card. I bought myself a 64MB card and was able to hold something like 120 pictures at the basic quality, 35 at high quality, and 20 at supreme quality. The basic quality was fine for sharing with friends, but if I wanted to print out the pictures or have them turned into 'real' photos, a higher resolution would be preferred. 

Keep in mind that if you are going on a vacation it can be a little hard to download your photos while on the road. You can either buy an extra data storage card, use a lower quality resolution, or take fewer pictures. I bought an extra card myself on my last vacation. 

The size of the camera was about average, but occasionally felt a bit big on long tours. On the flip side, the camera felt pretty sturdy and was even able to withstand one drop in a museum. Boy, did my heart skip a beat! 

The only other minor pet peeve I had with the camera was the flash. The flash must be raised manually, so it is easy to forget to use it in medium light. The good thing is that you can easily erase an old photo and try again. 

This camera was brand new back in 1999 and so now many others have been released that have similar functionality packed in smaller packages. But for the price and functionality, this is a great camera. 

That's it.
