            I love the way they redesigned the 2003 model.  I've been watching this car since it first came out, and I was happy to see that they eliminated a bit of the "wedge" look.  I'm in love with my car so I will try to be unbiased.  =)

Driving it has been great.  It's raised up a bit, more than the average car.  If I look at cars around me, I'm always seated higher than everyone else.  I feel as though I'm almost as high up as a minivan, and it gives me better vision.

I'm thrilled with the gas mileage.  On highway driving, I get up to 50 miles per gallon, depending on the circumstances.  This is important for me, because I do a lot of distance driving.

The interior space is excellent.  I've had very tall and large passengers, both in the front and the back, and all were impressed with the amount of space for the size of the car.  I've had several friends and family members that have since considered buying one or recommending it.

The trunk space is great too.  One might think this isn't a good vehicle for camping, but I use it for this a couple of weekends per month, and so far it's been great.  The rear seats split 60/40, so I can lower one or both, depending on what extra space I need.

I love the placement of the dashboard gauges.  It's at a 45 degree angle to the right of the steering wheel.  At first it would seem awkward, but I quickly found that it was in a very natural position for my peripheral vision.

It has little storage compartments everywhere, which come in handy.  I always have an extra pocket or compartment to stick stuff in.

I chose blue for the color of my car, and I would recommend it to everybody.  I've had so many people comment on the way it 'gleams' in the sun, and that's not because it's clean.  It almost has a two-tone element to it, that I haven't noticed in the other colors.

Now for my complaints, because no matter how much I love it, nothing can be perfect.

I'm a short person, and one of my pet peeves is that I can't reach down to the gas tank latch very easily.  I have to lean forward and down, because it is placed too far out of my reach.  This is because the seats are much higher up than the average car.

It doesn't handle so well when you combine high speeds with high winds.  If you're a speed demon, stay off the freeway under extremely windy conditions.  I feel like I'm practically going to be blown off the road.  I don't know if this is due to it's light weight, or it's aerodynamics, however it's only happened a couple of times in almost a year.  I don't combine these conditions very often.

The interior fabric and material is not quite sub-standard, but almost.  It looks a little cheap on the inside.  To me this is understandable however, it's an inexpensive car, and if they have to cut corners, I'd rather it be on the looks than the mechanics.
