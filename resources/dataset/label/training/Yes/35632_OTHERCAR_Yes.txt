            The Chevy Malibu is my first car.  I bought the '98 LS model a little over a year ago.  My car still only has 15k miles on it, but as of yet, it has been very reliable.  The only problem I had was with the parking brake.  It sounded the warning even when it wasn't on.  The V6 engine is more powerful than any other V6 I've driven and the stereo system is extremely clear.  The ride is very smooth and the engine is one of the most quiet in its class. I would suggest this car both to teenagers and families.  My mom happens to own a '99 version of the same car. <br><br>
