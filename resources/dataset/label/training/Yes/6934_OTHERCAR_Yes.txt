            This car is what the future has for us. Almost no emissions and no plug-up needed. The look is based off the CRX. The most aero dynamic car in production. You can drive up too 700 miles on just one gas tank. The gas tank only holds 10.6 gallons at full. 70 mpg hwy or 61 city,how could anyone pass this up? The engine stay's on until you press the clutch in and shift to neutral. The electric motors comes at the same time. As soon as you press the clutch the gas motor comes back on without notice. This hybrid car has all the safety as the big brother Accord and Civic. Air Condition is also an oposition. Having been build from Formula One racing seats and steering wheel and suspension all in one car. I highly recommend this car to people that travel long distance to work or travel. This car is also for those worried about emissions. This car is for everyone.<br><br>
