            Not as big and bulky as my Dad's 1993 Lincoln Town Car, and not as fun to drive as my brother's 1999 BMW 328I - the '98-'02 Continental falls in between.

It is spacious and very nicely appointed.  Mine isn't even one of the fancier models, but it is very distinctive.  Ford has only managed to sell about 15,000 - 25,000 of these per year, so you don't see too many of them on the road.  They really are nice looking cars, borrowing heavily from the Jaguar type of styling.

It handles better than you'd expect.  I grew up with the Mercury Grand Marquis and Ford Crown Victoria family of cars, and the front-wheel drive Continental handles much better than it's rear-wheel drive, body-on-frame counterparts from the Ford family. With traction control, you feel completely in command of the road.  The car does have an annoyingly large turning radius.

The automatic four speed shifts seemlessly, and after driving four cylinder Accords for the past 6 years, stepping on the gas and feeling the power of that V8 kick is a nice feeling.

Though it's slightly larger than many of the luxury cars it competes with, it's actually lighter in weight than the Acura RL and its V8 engine accelerates faster but gets the same gas mileage as that car's V6.

The interior is very comfortable (I'm 6'1", 300 pounds) and the controls are well designed. I love all the chrome and leather - you know these cars aren't cheap to manufacture.  I do wish the cup holders were placed better, but nothing is perfect. The sound system is amazing! The back seat has ample room for 3.  

I was considering buying a used Acura TL, Nissan Maxima/ Infinity I30 or Toyota Avalon from '98 or '99.  These cars generally ranged in price from $15,000 to $20,000.  I also considered the Cadillac Catera, but decided not to based on generally bad reliability reports.  I think you get FAR more for LESS money with a late model Continental.

I paid $13,995 (3/02) for '98 with 58,000 miles, and had a compatible 10 CD changer added for another $400. The car is in excellent condition.

Ford redesigned the Continental in 1998 and only slightly tweaked it through 2002 (the last model year).  For that period, the car is on the Consumer Reports recommended used car list for reliability.

Because they depreciate so heavily, the Continental becomes an excellent buy on the used market.  A '98 Continental will run you less than a '98 Camry or Accord.

After a year of driving, I'm happy to report that the car has proven to be very reliable.  I had the serpentine belt replaced, and a small transmission fluid leak had to be fixed. My engine "idiot" light came on, and that proved to be some kind of minor vacuum leak combined with an out of place air cleaner. None of these repairs have cost over $175.
