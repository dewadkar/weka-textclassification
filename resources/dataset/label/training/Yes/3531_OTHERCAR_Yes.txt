            I had been wanting to buy a Digital Camera for the last year but didn't want to spend a ton of money.  So when I found this camera for $269 at HPShopping.com I decided to go for it.

I'm happy with the camera, it shoots sharp pictures and is simple to use.  I especially like the fact that you are not forced to use the LCD all the time, thus saving battery life.  The menus are easy to understand.  And USB is great since its hot-swappable, I can plug it in and out easily between the 3 PCs I use on a regular basis.  There are 3 quality settings but I tend to use the second setting, since the resolution is the same (1600 X 1200) on the high and medium setting.s  I haven't figured out what the difference is except that the file size doubles on the &quot;Super-Fine&quot; setting.

Things I didn't like.  First of all, I had a hard time figuring out how to install this camera on my main PC.  After a couple of hours of trial and error, I figured out the problem.  There was a conflict with my MP3 player's software that would make my PC crash while detecting the camera through USB. Kinda of a pain though.  Pictures taken with the built in flash are sometimes washed-out, not the best.  But flash tends to wash-out color depth anyways.  The digital Zoom is terrible.  If you're looking for a camera with a zoom, buy one with an optical zoom.  The digital zoom, pixelizes the picture, colors bleed into one another.  I never use it anymore.

I bought 2 sets of rechargable NiMH batteries and they last forever, I haven't had to change them yet.  The set of Alkalines it came with only lasted 2 days or so.  It might be a good Idea to buy some Nickel rechargables.  I also decided to use the 64MB flash card from my MP3 player since the 8 meg card it came with only allows for about 20 photos on medium setting and 10 on the high setting.

I'm happy I bought this camera, for the money you can't beat it!<br><br>
