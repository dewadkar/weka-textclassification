            I was looking for a camera that was small enough to fit in my pocket for a trip to Italy. I wanted this camera to be of high quality and easy to use. After much research, the Minolta Dimage X was the one I chose. This little camera takes very good pictures. I was also pleased with the battery life. You can set the camera to shut off to conserve power at various time intervals. I did a lot of walking in Italy and I did not once feel that I was encumbered by lugging around a camera. I did not even know I had it with me. The camera took great pictures, and was so easy to download. I took tons of pictures and was amazed with the quality. The zoom lens worked great. It is highly innovative due to the fact that the lens is contained in the camera body. Everyone who has seen the camera and the pictures that it takes want to know more about it. All comments were very positive. The battery also charged quick, and not once did I run out of battery life. I set my auto shut off for 3 minutes to conserve battery life. Overall, this is quite a nice camera in a little package. Wow! I am still impressed. I am a Quality Director and I am very conscious regarding quality of products in my field. This is a quality product 
   There are a few cons. Cost is still high, but this will come down. The lens is in the upper corner of the camera body. You have to get used to positioning your finger or you will wind up having shots ruined because of this. After taking a couple pictures which showed my finger on the edge of the frame, I adjusted my grip and did not have any more problems. Also, the 8mb card is too small. I bought a 64mb card and I took well over 100 pictures without ever filling the card.
