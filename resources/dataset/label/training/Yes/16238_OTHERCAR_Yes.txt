            Earlier this summer, we bought a brand new Toyota Corolla LE.  We looked at the Toyota Camry.  We checked out the Honda Accord.  I had been driving a Honda Accord for about 5 years, and my better half drove it for the first five years of its life.  We loved that Accord.  It was reliable, fairly low cost maintenance, and it drove really comfortably.  So that was what I was looking for in the new car as well.

I did a lot of online research, and certain cars really stood out.  Obviously the Honda Accord was once again an excellent car.  The Toyota Camry was its Toyota equivalent. 

You see, we have one &quot;handicap&quot;.  My husband is 6 foot 7 inches.  So you can understand that he can't just drive any car out there!

The Toyota Camry was clearly an excellent car.  We test drove it, and frankly, it was very tight fit for him.  His knees were in his chest.

The Honda Accord was much better.  The fit was fairly good, and it was everything we expected from the Accord, being previous owners.

But then we started looking at cost.  For the amount we wanted to spend we could get a bottom of the line Camry or Accord.  So we looked at the two models one step down.  Because this is where my husband made a briliant statement.  &quot;I'd rather have a top-of-the line Corolla, then a bottom-end Camry&quot;.  And he was absolutely right.

By going &quot;down&quot; to the Corolla we were able to deck it out, get the high-end model, and get all the extras, while still spending only a thousand dollars more than a low end Accord or Camry.

And it was an excellent decision.  We are both thrilled with the car.  The ride is smooth, it handles superbly.  It's comfortable.  The extras, like power windows, power doors, and the final extravagance, the moonroof, are very nice little extras that make you feel like you are driving around in a much more expensive vehicle.

It rides as well as my old Accord.

It has several safety features that you will not find in other cars in its range, like the side-impact bags (I don't know of another car in this range that has them!).  ABS, and dual front airbags (and I don't mean the driver!!)

And finally, to put the finishing touches on, we shopped using the internet, Autobytel and various other quoting services, and saved easily another $2000 dollars by taking the time to get several quotes and talking to more than one dealer.

It may sound like I've been downplaying the Corolla as second-best.  It's not.  In many ways it is the affordable alternative to what has become an outrageously expensive Accord or Camry choice.  

I've only owned the car for a little while now, but I expect to get ten good years and many miles out of it, because it has the Toyota quality that we look for in a car!
