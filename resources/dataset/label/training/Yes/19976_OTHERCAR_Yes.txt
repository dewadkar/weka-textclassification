            With a huge Z26 6 cylinder engine, this car kicks some major butt. It's a real stylish car, I got the Plum color and get compliments all the time.  I don't know about you guys and girls, but when you put your foot on the accelerator this Chevy really kicks in quick, helps merging on serious high ways a lot.  Also the front seats are extremely comfortable, I've slept in them a couple of times, and to change the stock stereo is no big deal at all.  Some options that come with the Z26 model which sold me were the great alloy wheels, the stylish interior and the great look the car brings, it turns head in parking lots.  The older version of the Beretta was used in the Daytona 500.  It was a very popular car in the late 80's and early 90's and it's easy to see. Also, it's a very safe car, and I'm still accident free (knock on wood), because of the great handling that the Beretta Z26 brings to the table.  I had this car while a high school senior and it's considered an extremely cool car for the younger adult, I love it, and still own the mint condition beauty.  So drive on and I'll catch you out on the road.<br><br>
