            This is NOT a man's car.

That point being made, I can now commence to the review of the 1997 Mazda Miata MX-5 STO Edition. The Miata is one of Mazda's success stories and was the best in its class when convertible sports cars made their resurgence in the mid-1990s. This car is well-engineered, well-marketed, and well-executed. It enjoys some of the highest customer loyalty in the business. I had several occasions to drive this car and was able to dispel some myths, as well as reinforce others. Let's address these myths, shall we?


<b><i>The Mazda Miata is Fun</i></b>

The diminutive size of the car as well as its lowered presence brings about a completely different driving sensation. The steering is very quick and precise, much akin to a go-cart. The only other vehicle I can compare it to in terms of throwing around corners is a Legends car I used to race in the late 1990s.

The convertible top alone makes for the quisential definition of fun. Even the 1980s K-Car convertibles were fun. The Miata's top is easy to put down once the somewhat stiff latches are loosened. Putting the top up is simple from outside the car although it can be done by a reasonably strong man or woman from the driver's seat. Running around town with the top down is the natural habitat of the Miata. In all reality, the car doesn't quite look right with the top up. Fortunately Florida is highly conducive to this behavior and the car gets a chance to be aired out repeatedly in this manner.

Conclusion: It's impossible to have a bad time in this car.


<b><i>The Mazda Miata is Cute</i></b>

Undeniably so. Even from the point of view of this cynical, college-educated redneck, I acknowledge the high cuteness factor. It has all the appeal of a Pomeranian puppy on caffeine. This, however, reinforces my assertion that this is not a man's car.


<b><i>The Mazda Miata is Fast</i></b>

The Miata, while small and sporty, will never be mistaken for a race car. The 4-cylinder 1.8 Liter engine coupled with the 5-speed manual transmission (an automatic is available, but who the hell would DARE put such an aberration in a SPORTS CAR?) is spritely and revs quickly, however 133 Horsepower can pull 2293 lbs of car and 200 lbs of dead weight hereafter referred to as the driver only so fast. The acceleration is a little short of brisk, though onramps are not life and death situations. Running through the gears is great fun as the throws are short and the shifting solid and precise.

Handling falls short of racing specs as well. The go-cart steering makes whipping around corners fun and the body experiences moderate lean. Since the car wasn't mine I didn't feel brave enough to test the full cornering capability of the car. The tires aren't the beefiest so coupled with the somewhat flexible suspension and the twisting nature of a convertible chassis it might serve you well to leave the Dodge Viper down the street alone on road courses.


<b><i>The Mazda Miata is Impractical</i></b>

Two seat cars are not particularly utilitarian. They're more for hauling ass than for hauling groceries or luggage. The Miata, while no hot rod, is a zippy little wagon. Trunk space is very limited. The models up to and including 1997 have a very small storage area where a full paper grocery bag won't clear the deck lid. Mazda rectified this in 1998 when they redesigned the trunk and moved the spare tire. Then again, Miata drivers don't NEED groceries as they're always cruisin' through the drive-through lanes or the finer restaurants in town.

Miatas are popular cars, and this is reflected in the price. It didn't take long for Mazda to hike the price thousands over the advertised list. The cars have held their value well as used items, but their priciness keeps them from being a stellar value. Bang for the buck coefficient is still good as this is just a tight little package.

This car has an 89-inch wheelbase and only grew to be 1 inch shy of 13 feet in length. It also sits extremely low to the ground. As a result, virtually everything else looks intimidating. Accords look scary. Old VW Bugs look frightening. Quart cans of Malt Liquor are a serious threat. In this world of SUV drivers, the Miata has all the makings of a 98-lb weakling and is treated accordingly. Being less than a passive driver I did have occasion to vent on a few surly SUV bullies. I'm happy to report no gunshots were fired in my direction. This is not a car for the aggressive or those with short attention spans.

As far as a daily driver, the car is highly livable. The interior is laid out smartly and gauges are easily read. Rattles are an absolute minimum, mileage in combined city/highway driving is at about 24 MPG, and the Miata has a commendable reliability record. The owner says she hasn't yet had a repair and is currently at 30,000 miles. It seems silly to discuss such base principles with a fun machine, but eventually the initial glitter and buzz wear off of the date from the company party, and you have to face that person in the light of day. Fortunately the Miata is pretty attractive in the morning, so to speak.


<b><i> The STO Designation</i></b>

This is a limited edition car. Only 1500 were made in the summer of 1997 and Mazda did very limited advertising. The STO-specific features are:

* Any shade of Twilight Blue paint
* Tan Leather Interior and Top
* Mesh Alloy Wheels
* Leather shift knob (Woo.)
* Headrest speakers
* Touring Package (power steering, windows, etc.)

All this adds up to a premium over the already steep price, and the STO flavors stand a good chance at becoming collectibles in due time. The price is also reflected during resale, and the owner paid just over 13 Large for hers.


<b><i>The Mazda Miata appeals to single females in mid-life crisis.</i></b>

Also known as the women's corollary to the Harley Davidson (aka the male mid-life crisis remedy). Contrary to popular belief, not all owners of this vehicle fit this demographic. In fact, I have met BOTH owners that are none of the above. Nevertheless, consider that the car is cute, that it's not powerful, it's not pretentiously dressed like a boy-racer, and that it's perfect for the driver and that significant other (or significant canine). Then take note of the driver the next few times you see one of these cars around town.

My take: It's a fun, sporty, reliable car that will have lasting value and appeals to single mid-life crisis females of ALL ages and genders.

But it will never be a man's car.
