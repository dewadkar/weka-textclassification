            I received this camera as a gift.  It came highly recommended at the camera store.  It's incredibly easy to use for a novice like myself, but also has plenty of options for the advance photographer.  It's so simple to plug into a computer and quickly download the pictures.  Once the pictures are downloaded they can be e-mailed, posted on the internet, or even printed out thanks to all the internet digital printing companies.  It still costs more per picture for digital prints but it's worth it because you only get the ones you want, which tremendously makes up for the extra cost.  The 8MB card it comes with is definitely not large enough unless you plan on downloading a lot so it's worth the extra money to get a larger card.  I have a 64MB card and it will hold 42 pictures on the highest resolution.  I've found that being able to constantly take pictures, especially at sporting events or other high-movement events, and then deleting the bad pictures, I get more pictures that I'm very happy with.  Using the LCD screen drains the batteries extremely fast, but since it shows the picture for 3 seconds after, it's not a problem for me to take lots of shots and then sort through them all at once or wait to go through them until I've downloaded them.  I'm still experimenting with all the different options, which keeps things interesting.  Anyone thinking about buying a digital camera should take a look at this one!<br><br>
