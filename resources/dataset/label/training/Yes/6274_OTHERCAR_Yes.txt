            After a very long and painful negotiation with my very elderly great aunts, I finally agreed to move in on the condition that they would help me buy a car.  I was excited to know that soon I would be off of the hell rollercoaster that Chicago calls the CTA.  Back and forth from car dealer to car dealer I searched for an affordable used car.  I finally determined that I would be ripped off no matter where I go, so I decided to buy new.  I mean why get jipped and be stuck with a problem that someone else couldn't fix, when I can get ripped off on a new car and cause my own.  I thought it made sense too.

Several months had passed and I miraculously came upon a Hyundai dealer.  I had a friend who owned one so I said what the heck.  I flagged down an oh-too-eager salesman.  I told him not to worry I was there to buy a car.  I think he actually started to froth at the mouth!  Anyway that's not important.  He began to show me the beauties of the Accent class.  I picked the white one.  He kept pointing me to the black one, but I wanted the white one.  We drove the white one, then to humor him, I got into the black one.  Oh dear, the black one had a stick shift!  I thought I could be very cold and drive the black one, but then I imagined a very large transmission bill coming to my home and decided to be friendly and simply take the white one.  

Needless to say, it's been two years plus a few months since I bought my first brand new 1998 Hyundai Accent and I have yet to need any engine repairs.  The power isn't like a viper, but it also only has four cylinders.  I opted for the no power anything package, and so far, I haven't had any problems with my power anythings.  I love my car and you should too!<br><br>
