            After the birth of my son, I became obsessed with getting rid of my old clunker and finding a safer more reliable form of transportation. Well, I found all that and more when I researched and then purchased my 97 Maxima 4-door GLE.
This car has all the goodies without the expensive sticker shock of an �off-the-lot� new model.
It�s a solid, smooth-riding sedan with a hearty V-6 engine that provides power and performance. It�s comfortable and roomy enough for my 6�1� husband � even if he�s sitting in the back seat with the baby. This was a big selling point since we travel quite often. (No more squished seating and crushed knees!) This model has ABS brakes, power seats, power sunroof, CD changer and cruise control, just about every feature under the sun. 
The biggest area of compliant would have to be the placement of some of the controls. The gas cap release is near the floor on the driver�s side, which makes it difficult to reach, especially for taller drivers. And the trunk release is on the driver�s door, so it�s very easy to hit and pop open if you�re using the adjusting seat controls.
All in all, the good far outweighs the bad on the Maxima, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new (or nearly new) car.
