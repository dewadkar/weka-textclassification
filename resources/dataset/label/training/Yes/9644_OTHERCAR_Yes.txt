            Well I would like to start by saying the dodge neon is a decent car. It has decent gas mileage, decent styling, and a decent price. What I don't like is it has less than decent saftey features. Sure it's a decent family car but it's less than impressive saftey record is reason for concern. I had a friend who was in a serious wreck in a neon. His air bag failed to deploy properly and as a result his neck injuries are costing him thousands of dollars, not to mention the pain he must be going through. It has been three months now and my friend is still in a neck brace. Is it an isolated incident? Maybe. But I think it shows a dangerous trend in automobiles today. Companies are more concerned about making thier cars seem &quot;Cute&quot; rather than safe. Dodge has spent almost double the money on thier product appeal research than on thier safety research. I can only hope that ford and Chevorlet don't follow that example. So while it may be a cute little car that has a decent and economical packaging. I will have to say my personal experience leads me to give this car a thumbs down<br><br>
