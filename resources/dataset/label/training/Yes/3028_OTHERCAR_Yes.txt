               When our old car started having serious repair problems we decided we better trade in it quick and find something more reliable. So we started looking around dealerships for an inexpensive used car in the 7,000 to 8,000 dollar range and we came across the Oldsmobile Achieva. We liked both the car and the price, but since it was actually one of the very first cars we had seen we decided to shop around a bit first to see what else was out their in comparison and then decide.

   After visiting several dealerships we decided to go back to the first lot and take a second look at the Achieva since it was definitely by far the best thing we saw the whole weekend that was in our price range. It only had 52,000 miles on it and was a 1997 and looked in great shape. Definitely a lot better than our old car which was a 93 and had 72,000 miles on it and was falling apart. 

   We decided to take it for a final test drive before we made our final decision. It drove wonderfully. The engine was pretty quiet and it had a lot of pick up for a smaller sized car. It also braked well. The interior, although a bit small for a family vehicle, was in excellent shape and very nice. It also had air conditioning, air bags (both driver side and passenger), safety head lights (which basically means the headlights stay on all the time, which I know annoys some of the other people who wrote Epinions on the Achieva, but they don't really bother me since I don't ever have to remember to turn my lights on or off since they're on all the time anyways, LOL. So it's actually more convenient in a way).

   When we had finished our test drive we decided this was the car for us. It is a very nice car and even though I really wanted a mini-van or other larger family type car had we the money, it was still a very nice car for the price and it did have a roomy trunk good for hauling all our toddler and baby paraphernalia like a stroller and such with room to spare for groceries. So we traded in our old car and bought the Achieva for about the same monthly payments we were paying on our old car so we were happy.

   So far, so good. We have been driving our Oldsmobile Achieva for about 6 months now and it is good on gas and drives really nicely. No problems or repairs (aside from your usual oil change and a found squirrel nest inside the air filter, LOL). Bit other than that no problems *knock on cyber wood*. So if someone is looking for a good, reliable, low maintenance, reasonably priced car I would highly recommend the Oldsmobile Achieva.
