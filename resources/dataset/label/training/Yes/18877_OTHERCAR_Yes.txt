            I love my 1998 RAV4.  I bought this car 2 years ago because I had recently been divorced and my minivan was about to die.  One of my good friends told me I needed a new look since I was no longer married.  I tend to do vehicle shopping when I'm driving around town.  I fell in love with the look of the RAV4 when they first came out.  I get about 28 miles to the gallon.  I have not had one problem with it.  I can honestly say I would not change a thing about the vehicle.  This is the perfect vehicle for someone who likes to spend time in the mountains or for someone who spends lots of time in the city.  It is a fairly small SUV so if you have more than 2 children I would not recommend it. I recently attended a focus group on SUV's, about half the people attending owned a RAV4 and everyone just RAVVED about their vehicle!<br><br>
