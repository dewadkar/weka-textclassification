            I researched the Focus SE Wagon for months before making the decision to purchase. It seemed the ideal step up from my 1993 Toyota Tercel. I got exactly the model I wanted, save for the CD player (which I now see is standard on the 2001 models) and was completely in love with my new car for about 2 weeks.  

I quickly became disenchanted with the gas mileage, especially with the Southern California gas prices hovering just under $2 @ gallon these days. One of the main reasons I wanted the Focus was for the reported fuel economy of 29/33 miles per gallon city/highway. I'm finding my automatic transmission getting only around 20/25 miles per gallon, far less than I had anticipated. Perhaps I'd been spoiled by the ultra-economical standard Tercel transmission, but I'm still shocked at how quickly that needle falls to empty.

I've now had my wagon for 5 weeks.  At this very moment it's back at the dealership for the second time in as many weeks.  First, the cruise control completely quit working halfway home from a 400 mile long road trip.

THEN! Yesterday I noticed a black plastic pin of some kind sitting on the floor underneath the pedals.  By last night, the accelerator pedal had completely come loose and was just dangling like some child's stubborn loose tooth.  Terrifying!  Luckily I was stopped at a light (albeit in the left turn lane) when the gas pedal came apart.

Just like last time, the dealership does not have the part and has to keep my car until the part arrives from the factory, no time estimate.

The attention to detail is just poor all around. The rear of the wagon is rather noisy and squeaky. A piece of interior trim over one of the back seat doors is already coming off. And when my front seat passenger reached down by the center console to retrieve a fallen item, a sharp plastic protrusion shaved a chunk off the top of her finger.

Don't get me wrong... I really like this car - the way it feels, the way it drives - but I'm fairly shocked that I've had these kinds of problems already. I feel like I'm just waiting for what falls apart next and I don't even have the license plates yet.  I'm beginning to feel Ford was just a little too anxious to get this car on the road.<br><br>
