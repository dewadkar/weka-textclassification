            I have owned and driven a 1999 Alero GLS sedan for the last year, and I'm continually thrilled with it.  First and foremost, the engine is terrific--having so much low-end torque makes the Alero a near-perfect car for ever-challenging Boston traffic.  When I was shopping compact cars last year, the only one I drove with anywhere near as much torque was the Saab 9-3, but it suffered from serious turbo lag and torque steer.  Say what you will about big, inefficient American engines, they work swell in a smallish car.  The engine also works well with the transmission.

I also adore the Alero's brakes, especially since the short stopping distances make the engine's power all the more usable.  Handling is very solid, not quite as good as my previous car ('87 Audi 5000S Quattro) or some of the others I looked at (the New Beetle), but much better than previous GM designs.  (okay, that's not saying much)  I have the performance suspension option, which is acceptable in most situations but can be a bit stiff on frost heaves.  Traction control and anti-lock brakes make it a very good winter-driving car.

The front seats are very comfortable and supportive.  I'm a big guy, and the Alero is one of the few cars I can drive comfortably for a ten-hour day without any back pain.  I have never ridden in the back seats, but those who have say they are reasonably comfortable (not for tall folks, though).  Controls make sense, ventilation is very good, etc.  The cupholders could be placed a bit better.  The standard stereo is a good-quality original equipment model...nothing to write home about, but the separate tweeters are a nice and noticeable touch.  The trunk is fairly large for a small car--I moved using the Alero, and it took just as many trips as it previously had with my (much larger) Audi.

My only major complaint is the ride height--the lower front spoiler occasionally scrapes the ground while driving over speed bumps and such.   I had to replace the front fascia and a fog light last winter after getting caught on an icebank while backing out of a driveway in rural NH, which could happen to any car but seemed a little too &quot;easy&quot; with the Alero.

To sum up, the Alero is a wonderful city car.  It's not too big, has great power and brakes and good space for the size.  I would recommend it highly to people without kids or small kids, but adolescents would have trouble riding in the back seat for long periods.  It's not a perfect car for those travelling long distances, since the fuel economy is only average (I get 25 MPG) for this size class and the the torque of the V6 is somewhat wasted--the four cylinder engine so common in rental Aleros probably makes a lot more sense for long Interstate trips.

But until I get my M3, the Alero is a little bit of perfection.<br><br>
