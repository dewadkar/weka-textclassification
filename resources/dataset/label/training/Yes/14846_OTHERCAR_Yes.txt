            The only reason I have the 2000 Bravada is because my husband wanted a boat and we had nothing with which to tow it.  He had a Ford Ranger pickup and I had a Buick Regal (which I loved!!).  I was very attached to and did not want to trade my Regal and did so very reluctantly.  We purchased the fully loaded Bravada Platinum Edition used (leased) and I have been driving it now for four months.  It is indeed like driving (and riding in)  a luxury car.  A friend has a Lexus and the Bravada actually rides better!  The handling is excellent, the sound system controls on the steering wheel make it much safer to adjust than using the ones on the radio - your eyes never really have to leave the road.  The leather interior is beautiful and the auto seat setting is great.  It also came with an automatic starter so on winter mornings I can start it from inside my house instead of running our in my robe to do it!  I am very cold-natured so I know I will love the seat warmers this winter.  The only two things I do not like about the Bravada are low gas mileage and less power than I would like.  Overall, this is a wonderful SUV and I have received many compliments on it.  Even though I did not want it - I'm so glad I have it!!
