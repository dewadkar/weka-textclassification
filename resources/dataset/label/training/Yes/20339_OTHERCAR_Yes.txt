            I've had my Altima for 6 years now, and it was money well spent.  This car is a gem and I plan on keeping it when I buy my next car.  There are many upside and compared to downsides for this car:

Cost:
The Altima was well price for it's competition the year in which I purchased my baby.  Of course there was a dip in the price the following years, but I liked my model far better then the ones that have taken it's place.

Handling:
This is a sore spot for the Altima as it is not very agile.  Basically, you can expect to make many 3-point turn in turning about.  This is a sore spot for people who like to "whip about" in turn, but I still love my car on the road.  It handles very well on the highway and I've driven this puppy from all the way in Maine, down all the way to Florida, from New York to California!!!  

Endurance/Fuel Efficiency
I've had very little heavy maintenance on my car and it's been a dream in cost for repairs.  Fuel cost is different as the Altima can travel about 320 miles before you start getting really, really nervous!  The tank is only 12-14 gallons, and you get about 25-28 miles on the hwy, and about 21-24 miles otherwise.

Interior:
The Altima has a decent interior, and it's a comfortable ride.  The trunk is large, but since it's got an awkward opening and rear end, it's hard to get large items into it.  You can always move the backseat to get tot the trunk.  The wood paneling is beautiful and makes the interior look really classy.

Overall, I've covered most of the features that I've come to love and hate about my baby!  If you get a chance to get an Altima of under Blue Book value, make sure you don't hesitate.
