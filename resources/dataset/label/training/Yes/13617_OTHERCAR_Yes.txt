            The Range Rover Hunter was my first Rover vehicle. I had just moved to Lake Tahoe from the bay area and realized I needed a serious 4 wheel drive truck.  I had my eye set on a Toyota Land Cruiser and almost bought one.
 The Rover won out because of it's much higher holding power on steep grades. The Hunter version of the truck was a basic stripped model (no power seats or leather ect) but was comfortable and solid. 
I remember very clearly the first day driving the hunter on the way home. I bought the truck in Reno and took the short route up to Incline Village.
 The pass over Mt. Rose is 8923' . About halfway up it started snowing hard and the wind picked up reducing vision. I was nervous because the truck was new and I was inexperienced in serious weather. Cars and trucks were stalled and off the road. Ice was everywhere. 
The Rovers full time 4 wheel drive was superb and not for one second did I feel like control would be lost. Another excellent feature was the heated windshield. Rovers use  resistance elements embedded in the glass which heat the windshield in conjunction with the standard defroster. This feature is wonderful at reducing ice buildup on wiper blades, eliminating the need to get outside in the blowing snow to clear the blades.
Another seemingly small thing I use constantly is the outside temp gauge. It's very useful for determining how serious the conditions are.
All of my current vehicles have one.
 I kept the truck for four years, and put 150 thousand miles on her. We had few problems. The steering box starts to get sloppy after 110 thousand miles but was easily fixed. Oil consumption started to rise after valve guide seals wore out at 80 thousand miles but Rover repaired them at no charge.
The electrical connectors for the rear defroster would fail occasionally also. Another minor sniggle is in the coldest weather my feet would get cold no matter how the heater was set. The problems overall were minor and I would gladly have that truck again.
 I have owned now four Rovers over the years. My favorites are the classic Range Rover and the later Discoveries. The new Range Rovers are much too complex to be as reliable as my simple Hunter model. If you can find one that has been treated in a reasonable way you will find it a good companion<br><br>
