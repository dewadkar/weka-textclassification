            This is my first digital camera.  I originally bought a Kodak EasyShare cx4300.  I returned it because it lacked an optical zoom, which I realized quickly is a must! 

I purchased this camera as a photography enthusiast who was looking to go digital and wanted the whole package: ease of use, reasonable price, and enough features to satisfy the "bells and whistles" lover in me!

Here are the key points:

Optical Zoom: Optical zoom on a digital camera I feel is very important, as a digital zoom can blur the image and reduce photo quality.  The zoom on this camera is 3x, which is pretty decent and perfect for my use.  There is also a digital zoom included, giving the camera a combined 10x zoom. Personally, I have never used the digital.

Shutter Lag:  I found the shutter speed on this camera to be relatively quick, though I believe it might not be best for high action sports.  The auto focus requires you to hold it halfway done for a fraction of a second, then you can push it in completely and the picture is taken immediately.

Picture Quality:  When I first started snapping away, I must admit, I was a little leery.  The quality of the display screen can be misleadingly blurry.  Rest assured, whether you're putting the pictures on your computer, printing them yourself, or having them printed for you, the picture quality is EXCELLENT, even at the cameras lowest resolution setting ("Good").

Ease of Use:  I love the software put out.  The red eye reducer works wonderful.  It has a lot of editing functions that really do come in handy.  I've noticed that even with the "crop" function, the picture doesn't seem to go down in quality much.  I also like that fact that the main function you would use on a regular basis are a button away and at your fingertips. This means no scrolling between long menu's to find the desired settings.  Big time saver, and it makes it possible to get a quality "candid" shot!  Also, the USB cable connection is a snap! The transfer is fast, though I'm sure this depends on computer, and automatic!

Need for Extras:  This is the only downside I found, and as I understand it, these are the norm among digital cameras.  It is a must to get a memory card, without it you will barely get a rolls worth of pictures in it.  Thankfully, the type of card this camera takes is among the cheapest.  Also, you want to get a set of rechargeable batteries.  I got a set of 4 (the camera takes 2) along with the charger for $15.  Definitely worth it.  Kodak tried to convince you to buy the $80 "one touch transfer" dock.  I feel the transfer is already "one touch", so this is an unnecessary expense.  It's only real perk is that it recharges your batteries while it's docked, but since transfer is so fast, and I have 2 set of batteries, I don't have a use for this option really.
