            I was surprised to find this car under Passenger Cars and not under sports cars... maybe its the linage this car descends from, previous Grand Am's were not sporty at all, but this has all changed.

I am a proud owner of a 2000 Grand Am SE.  When I take it to school, my friends are envious of my silver bullet. Its a nice little (big) car. I own the 2-door model, and one would think, sporty, must have no back seat, well that's wrong.  I've taken 200-mile road trips in the back of my brother's Ford Cobra, and let me tell you there is NO back seat in that car.  As for the Grand Am, it is very specious in the back seat.  I have been in that car on even longer road trips, and I have always been relaxed and comfortable.

Being the driver, this car has spunk.  It has very nice pickup and rides very smoothly, almost like a sports car, but better.  The power steering is, well, very powerful.  It is very easy to turn on a time and maneuver around tight areas. (Although it has a nasty habit of running into things... but could that be the cars fault?)

While driving all the controls are in easy accessible locations.  The headlights go on automatically, which is a great feature.  I would have one complaint though.  The radio/tape player does not accept my tape for my portable CD player, you know the one where there's a wire hanging off the tape.  The servos of the tape player don't suck the tape all the way down, and then the player rejects the tape, spitting it back out.  There is plenty of leg room for both the driver, and the passenger on his right (as well as for the people behind as was mentioned) Another problem I've seen is that my friends, while sitting in the back don't quiet have a lot of head room, its enough, but going over large bumps, they tend to brush the ceiling, which doesn't bother them... too much.

The trunk is nice and big, and hold a lot of luggage or books or whatever.  The two back seats fold down so you could easily feed long boards of wood from the trunk into the passenger cabin.  

As for gas and maintenance, beside a little body work, I have not had to take my car into the shop for anything other then oil and spark plugs.  We bought it used, and I have haply put on thousands of more miles with no problem what-so-ever.  As for gas, its great on gas.  It gets about 15-20 miles per gallon, if you drive it with tact and not slam on the gas after every light turns green. (Ok you have to do it once or twice, this car rides so nice.) The car also has a traction control system which kicks in on rainy or icy conditions which really helps the backend, which is a little light.

This is a great car for both the teenager and the family transporter.  There is plenty of pep and plenty of room for both.  Driving my Grand Am is such a joy that I can foresee a long standing relationship with this reliable car.
