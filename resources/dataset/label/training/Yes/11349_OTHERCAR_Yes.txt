            We bought this vehicle because of a growing family.  I absolutely love the Grand Caravan.  The two side sliding doors make it a dream to move people and things in and out.  My five-year-old takes care of herself and her stuff on one side while I load the baby and my stuff on the other.  The seating arrangement is flexible and I have loaded many items of all sizes by flattening the rear bench or removing it.  On family vacations, it holds everything but the kitchen sink with space left over.  It is extremely comfortable to drive and easy on the back.

I have two small complaints.  The fabric on the front of the seats is nappy and pills up way too easily.  I am constantly &quot;shaving&quot; the seat where my daughter sits because it gets so fuzzy.  The other is that the carpet seems to stain very easily.  While I have been successful at removing the stains, it seems like a little more stain-resistance would be in order.

Other than that, love it, love it, love it!<br><br>
