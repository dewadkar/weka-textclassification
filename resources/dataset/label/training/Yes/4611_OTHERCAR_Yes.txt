               I finally took the plunge and bought a new 2001 &quot;Metallic Red II&quot; Corvette convertible.  Affectionately known as &quot;ticket red&quot; or &quot;Quota red&quot; by the locals, the color is fantastic with rich burgundy-red hues.  The sun reflects off the metallic in the paint like I have never seen before.  After eyeing the Corvette line for years, the C5 style is what I wanted.  It has been in production since '97 and it took me that long to fork over the cash for this toy.   At greater than $50k, it is difficult for any sort of financial justification.  So, don't even try.  It is all about emotions.   
    The only real problem is getting my overweight 40-something body in and out of this low to the ground vehicle.   It took practice, but now I can aggress and egress with the best of them.  Chevrolet makes this very easy with a programmable seat and steering wheel column that automatically slide out of the way allowing you to assume the driving position.  Once the key is in the ignition, the seat, lumbar supports, steering wheel, and mirrors automatically move to welcome you back.  Grab the leather steering wheel and you know you are home.   A simple turn of the key and that familiar deep bass rumbling of the powerful 350hp v8 delights the ears.   A light push on the gas  and you sink back into the leather bucket as the car takes off.  This car was designed for the short Texas freeway on-ramps.   Zero to 70 mph in well under 5 seconds, provides merge room to spare.  Even long hauls seem short with the well designed suspension and handling characteristics.   This car rides smooth and handles even the toughest corners with ease.  
    I never have had a convertible before, but I am glad I upgraded.  The open, unrestricted feeling without a roof overhead makes a Sunday drive unbeatable.  Even the stars at night are brighter.   With the ragtop down, the airconditioner seems to keep the cool air settled in the cabin.  Or, is it the aerodynamics?.   This is important as we frequently have had many days over 100F lately.  Above 70mph, the cabin heats up again, but who cares!

This car really has put the fun back in driving for me and I recommend the experience.
