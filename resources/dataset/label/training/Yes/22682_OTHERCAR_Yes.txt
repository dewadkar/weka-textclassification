            I bought my 98 Grand Am after having a 93 Grand Am Needless to say I loved this style and make of vehicle. I was unfortunate though I somehow received a car with a manufacturer defect in the computer. I had the car in for service 9 times in 5 months. 

I became frustrated I wanted the car but not the problems. I decided to write the manufacturer and they said all I could do was continue to take it for service as needed. I did, I figured this had to be a lemon so I contacted an attorney and after having the car for a year and working with my attorney, General Motors bought the car back from me and I received my down payment back to purchase a one.

 I did have a new Grand Am lined up to buy, the dealership sold it out from under me so I bought a Honda Accord which to this day I do no regret in the least. I would recommend the Grand Am because it can be sporty and family oriented, but always know your rights if problems arise.<br><br>
