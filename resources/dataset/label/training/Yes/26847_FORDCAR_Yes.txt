            Okay, I'll admit it. I used to be a mom in a mini-van, and now I've become something even more dreaded... a mom in a big, horkin' Expedition.

But guess what? This car is a dream car, not only because it's comfortable and it drives well, but also because whenever I drive it, other people in itty-bitty cars actually move out of my way.

Maybe it's the way I weave precariously in and out of lanes, or maybe it's just because I'm in a car that's large enough to run down a Tercel and barely leave a mark. Whatever. I love being the biggest car in the carpool lane. I love the way my window aligns with the McDonald's drive through window just right. And I love that I'm surrounded by what feels like tons of ice-green steel.

My kids are safe, I'm safe, and what else can I say? I'm BIG.<br><br>
