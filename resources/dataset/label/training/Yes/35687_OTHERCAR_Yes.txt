                 My family bought our 1995 Toyota Tercel a little over 3 years ago as a used car that had been in a low speed accident.  The car's incredible safety features were demonstrated in this accident as even at a realitively low speed, under 25 miles an hour I believe, the air bags, of which there are two both for the driver and the passenger, did deploy effectively and all passengers walked away safely.  However what I found especially great was that despite how small this car is, which I'll talk more about in a little bit, the frame of the vehicle was totally untouched.  Thus it was easy to restore and that is how we came into owning it.
     The size of the Tercel is especially nice.  When we first got this car I was just learning how to drive.  Having a small car that enabled tighter manuvering, tighter turns, and more control was definitely a plus for a newbie on the road.  It was and still is much easier for me to drive than the Mini-Van that my family also owns.  Now that I am on my own working and at school I have found that it gets incredibly great gas mileage, upwards of 30 miles to the gallon usually, and this is great for me especially with a tight cash flow.  
     We also have been fortunate to not need to have much mantenance done on the Tercel.  I have had to have the brake pads replaced on the front wheels but these pads had lasted at least 4 years and so they did not need replacing earlier than would have been expected. 
     There are a few defects in the Tercel that I feel obliged to point out.  First it is a defect with the 1995 models that the check engine light doesn't go off.  It is just constantly on the yellow caution light.  This presents a problem if something really is wrong with your engine you wouldn't know it until the light turned red.  Also the ventalation system must always have the A/C button turned on to have the piping right to get a good flow of cool or warmed air.  This same ventalation system also puts out a film that coats the inside of the windows and must be periodically, ever few months, be scrubbed off, and this takes some elbow work.  I'd say this is the biggest problem with the car.  Also the back seat can get a bit cramped in terms of leg room if  you have anyone who isn't petit or a child sitting back there.  The front seats are very roomy though.  Thus I'd say that this would be an excellent car for a single individual or a couple without older children.  <br><br>
