            Purchased this great car when it came off a lease in 1998.  Great car, very sporty to drive, great pick up and cornering with more storage room than it appears.  With 4 snow tires we can go anywhere we want in NH in the snow, no need for 4 wheel drive.  The Volvo dealership has been great, service is fast and reliable.  This is our fourth Volvo, no problems with any of them.  Recommended to anyone who wants a very reliable car that is fun to drive.<br><br>
