            There was really no need for me to purchase a new car.  I was driving a 1995 Dodge Neon Sport, and was very pleased with it.  However, as age and kicking a smoking habit settled in, I grew alittle too large for the Neon.  Also I was getting alittle tired of manual transmissions.  I came upon a dealership that had some leftover Cirrus/Stratus/Breezes sitting in their lots.  I being the car shopper I am, stopped in and was looking around.  I finally settled on a car that I'd like to purchase.  

The experience I had with the Candy Apple Red Cirrus LX-i has been a pleasure.  From the day picking up at the dealer, or 55,000 trouble free miles later, the only complaints I have with the car are minor.  The automatic transmission is VERY sluggish to respond.  This can be very annoying on hills, or passing on the highway.  If that seems earth shattering, my other complaint should tip the scales.  The front cupholders should be moved BACK about 2 inches.  Tall coffee cups do not fit all that well into the holders, and require tilting the cup, and having it rest under the dash on an angle.

From the aspect of controls, this is by far the best control layout on any Chrysler product.  All the controls are placed logically and within easy reach.  The driver seat controls are also flexible and easy to use.  The rear seats, are very comfortable, and are roomy.  Overall, this is the BEST Chrysler product I've owned to date, and would repeat this purchase many times over.<br><br>
