            This is the first time I've bought a digital camera.  I knew I wanted something with a higher resolution, starting over 2 megapixels, and perhaps a zoom would be nice.  I found the HP318 camera on sale after Thanksgiving at a local office warehouse store.  They were having a special that day--if you bought the camera, you got a 32MB compact flash card FREE.  

So I bought the camera, (the compact Flash card was out of stock, so it was shipped to me 4 days later) and it was so simple to use.  The camera came with batteries, a wrist strap, 8 MB of internal memory, the USB cable to connect the camera to the computer, and software to upload pictures.  There was a nice user's guide included, plus a coupon for new batteries.  There are 3 settings for pictures, "good" (one star), "better" (two stars) and "best" (three stars).  When you are reviewing your pictures, it tells you which setting was used for each picture--and if the zoom was used.

The camera has these features:  a 10 second timer, the ability to attach it to a tripod, an auto-flash, a 2x zoom, a red eye reduction, a regular flash, NO flash feature, a battery indicator light, the ability to hook it up to an AC adapter (not included), a nice 1.8" LCD panel to view your pictures, a view finder, so you can save battery juice if necessary, and it takes 4 AA batteries.

The software was easy to install.  I prefer to use Paint Shop Pro to manipulate photos, so I haven't really experimented with HP's photo imaging software yet. 

For my first digital camera, I'm very happy.  Pictures are so clear it's amazing!  The price was terrific for the features this camera has!!

The only thing I'd change about this camera is to put a lens cap or cover on it to protect the lens from scratches.
