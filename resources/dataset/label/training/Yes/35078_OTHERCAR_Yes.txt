            We purchased our Dodge Caravan about 3 years ago, and I knew I would never drive it.   It seemed so big and obtrusive.   Well, I got behind the wheel one day out of necessity, and I really dislike driving anything else.  The gas mileage is excellent, and loads of elbow room for everyone.  Our model even had child restraint seats installed...what a treat for my grandson to be comfortable in.

The nice thing about it is if we go to a drive up fast food joint, there is enough room to actually enjoy the meal, or to a drive in movie (one of the very few left in the country) we can actually relax while absorbing what we see, just as if we were home in our living room.

But the best part is the ride, and the comfort both in heating and cooling seasons.  The van is not too big as to be annoying to anyone else on the road, actually looking at it near some cars, it is not even as long, and we have the extended cab model...so, get out there, and get one of your own.  I don't know how I lived without it all these years.
