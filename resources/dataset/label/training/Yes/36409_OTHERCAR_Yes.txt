            This mini van is the best van i have ever seen .. My mother has had quite a few vans in my day and this is the best on that i have seen her own.  We have been dealing with the chysler dealer ship for many years and we have always had good service.  The van is a wondrful addition to the van family.  The ride is great.  holes in the road other blemishes in the road...no problem, this car takes it and keeps going.  You doint feel a thing.  The engin, a powerful 3.8 v6 provdes plenty of power.  The all weel drive makes it easy to drive in the snow and rain .  The in side is great to . Power seats and windows and the 6 speaker sound system is incredable.  The seats, oh my god, i could live in them.  Plenty of room for the saterday picnic and enough for the ball team to go to get icecream after the game!!!!!!  The double sliding doors are a great additive to the car.  it is a wonderful car. <br><br>
