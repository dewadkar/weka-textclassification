            Not a bad camera for the money!
( 2.3 Million-Pixel CCD)

Although it claimed not to be compatible with Windows 2000, I hooked the USB cable up and it worked great!  I also tried it with Windows 98 and 
ahd the same great success!  The USB transfer is VERY fast... taking only 
a matter of seconds to get all pictures off the camera.

Although it uses 4 AA batteries, they don't last very long!
(Especially if you use the LCD display very much!)
If you go with this camera, buy several extra NiMH batteries
to keep with you.

It comes with a soft side case that has a belt loop for carrying 
the camera around with you.  It doesn't weigh that much so I found
I took it with me much more than other cameras.

You can get started taking pictures without reading the manual,
but for things like viewing a slide show or deleting pictures,
you will probably consult the manual on which buttons to push.

The LCD display is nice.  (about 1.8 inches)  It allows you to
turn up the brightness so that it works in all but bright
sunlight.

One thing that this camera could use is an optical zoom lens. For photo
quality, I would not use the digital zoom that is a
feature of the camera.  You can get the same photo with software
after you take the picture in normal mode.

It comes with two 8 MB compact flash cards for storing pictures on them.  I found I could get about 20+ pictures on card before switching.  
(In Standard Mode) You might want to invest in a larger card too!

I am not a huge fan of PhotoSuite SE, the photo editing software that
comes with the camera.  I always use Adobe Photoshop myself...

Here is a link of sample pictures 
all of which were taken in standard mode ( about 300k in size )
