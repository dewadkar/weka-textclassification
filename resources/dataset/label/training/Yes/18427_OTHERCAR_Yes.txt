            I bought this car because we desperately needed a new car that wouldn't break the bank. The Toyota Corolla was it. We bought it new in 1997. It was the basic basic basic no-frills model. Power-nothing and no radio system. It sounds sad but it's all we needed and I knew I could count on it's reliability given the good reputation Toyota has. We had a CD player put in so we were happy.
This was an automatic, 4-door, 4-cylinder. It gets great gas mileage, usually needs one fill-up per week. This is very important because of the insane gas price increases. I have no problems with this car since I knew before I bought it that was definitely no BMW so I had all the expectations for a basic car. And it has met all those expectations. It's reliable, has not broken down yet (after 4 years of daily commuting) and shows no sign of breaking down anytime soon. 
This is a great car for a student/single person/couple/etc because it's compact but has enough room for 4 full grown adults, and a small person in the back. I don't recommend this as a family car, it can get cramped on long drives.
