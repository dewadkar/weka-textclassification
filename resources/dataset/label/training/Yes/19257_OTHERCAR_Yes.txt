            We purchased the Pontiac 2003 Montana Extended 1SA. This van has a very smooth ride that drives much like a car even though it's a mini-van. The response is very good and turning is very easy even though it has more radius due to the length of the extended van. The amount of cargo room is the best in it's class due to the ability to roll up both back rows of seats (the 2nd row is available in either split bench or captain's chairs). An extra chair is available in the 2nd row too, to give you 8 passenger seating (we love it!).  When you fold and roll these seats up, you create a lot more space while not needing to remove the actual seats, but that is easy to do if you want too.  The captain's chairs are equipped with latch systems for car seats and some of the models have the built-in child restraints too.

Overall it's an excellent value and has a great sporty look for those of you who don't want to own a mini-van but need to because of those little ones! 

ABS brakes is a must-have, make sure you get the van with this option.  They have standard options that are extra costs with other manufacturers such as tinted windows, heated mirrors, rear window defroster with wiper, and an in-dash CD player with an excellent deluxe radio.
