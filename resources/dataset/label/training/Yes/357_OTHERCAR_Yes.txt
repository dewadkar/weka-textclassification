            Yes I do own a forest green XTerra and it has to be the greatest investment that my family has made. This is one awesome car. NOthing and i mean nothing can stop it or get in the way of this machine. It is cool car that you can live in. It has amazing pick up and can burn many cars. It handles extremely well for such a large car. This car will last through anything. I got even got into a bad accident with and it came back from the shop perfect and i haven't had a problem with it yet. It has one feature unlike any other car. The back window that roles down give the car that super fly look. This SUV has plenty of space and has a huge truck for all your gear.
