            I have been driving my 1993 Toyota Camry LE since November 1992. I have racked up 121,000 miles (last glance on the odometer) I have not broken down or had any major disturbences in my driving. I have been in 2 crashes with this car (not my fault of course) and it still drives like new. One safety feature on this car, (I don't know if they have it on the newer models but) is a belt lock which locks if you jerk foward, stimulating a crash. This feature has activated during the two crashes I have been in and also activates when my kids put their seat belt on to fast. When my boy turns 16 in a year or two he might be driving it. This is a great car. If you want a great car get a toyota camry!
