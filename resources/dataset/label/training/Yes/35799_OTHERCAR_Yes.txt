            I purchased by 1995 Saturn in 1996 with relatively few miles. Since my purchase I have put nearly 40,000 miles on the car with no problems for the most part.
The best feature of the car is most definitely its gas mileage. The price to fill the tank is incredibly cheap considering that I get nearly 300 miles for each tank of gas. In the end, I usually get 30 miles to the gall for city driving and much more on the highway.
Additionally, the car is very easy to handle. Teaching me how to drive on the Saturn was one of the best choices that my parents made. It is extremely easy to turn and park. I've found this feature is particularly beneficial in busy and crowded parking lots.
One of the only problems that I've had with the car was that the factory tires on it were not very good. Their traction was problematic so I had to purchase a new set of tires shortly after the car was purchased. Also after getting in an accident, I was informed that Saturn parts are very expensive to purchase.<br><br>
