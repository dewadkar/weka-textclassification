            I bought my 1995 Toyota Corolla used, in 1996 because a friend owned one and when she switched to another make and model she never stopped complaining how much she missed her Corolla.  When I went looking for a used car I decided I wanted a Toyota car, preferably a Corolla but I was prepared to take even a Tercel.  Luckily I found a Corolla in an almost new condition and apart from a new battery, a new alternator recently, al ever have to do is change the oil.  It provides a comfortable ride and it is perfect for a college student or someone like me who is low to middle income.<br><br>
