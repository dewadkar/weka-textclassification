            <b>As an engineer focusing on usability everyday, it's really refreshing to be able to look at something and immediately be able to use it to it's fullest potential.</b>  That's exactly what happened a couple of weeks ago when I had the opportunity to test drive and autocross my friend's 91 Mazda Miata.  When you first sit in the car, everything, the steering wheel, gauges, air conditioning vents - even the pedals - are exactly where you's expect them to be.  <b>The ergonomics in this car is supurb.</b>  That's impressive, especially considering that the car is nearly 10 years old!

As a Porsche 911 owner, I was going to be pretty hard to impress in the power department - I knew that much going in.  But in this case, I drove the Miata for the first time in the autocross and nearly beat my best time in my 911!  In fact, after the day was over <b> my time in the Miata was only 0.10 seconds behind my best time in the 911.  Needless to say, what the Miata lacks in power it makes up for in very predictable, agile handling.</b>  

This Miata was equipped with Tokico gas shocks, an aftermarket exhaust, and racing seat belt to keep the driver from moving about the cabin while slinging the Miata through fast corners.  In addition, the Miata had one very important component that my 911 did not have - tires!  In fact, they were the number one choice for autocrossers and many road racers - BF Goodrich Comp T/A R1s.  Look for a review of those coming soon.

The transmission shifted very predictably and smoothly.  <b>The incredibly short and precise throw of the shifter was a huge departure from the 911.  With the Miata, it's as if the shifter is some sort of gaming joystick, whereas in the 911, it's more like an oar in the water.</b>

Brakes were very firm and responsive, but locked up easily.  They require a great deal of precise modulation to prevent lock-up (squeezing the brake until just before lock-up and then reapplying pedal pressure in a pumping fashion).

<b>These cars are getting really cheap.</b>  In fact, I recently saw one in the local classifieds for around $5000.  This would make a great second (or third) car to have fun with on the weekends.  <b>It's easy to drive, very forgiving if you get a little too agressive, has a tendency to oversteer when pushed (occasionally hanging the tail out a little around a corner), and looks great.</b>  Forget about the luggage though - anything more than a toothbrush and a change of clothes will probably be left behind.  

Some good used upgrades to look for include a very attractive hardtop (can be as much as $1000, though) and a rollbar (a good idea for any convertible). There are also a lot of performance upgrades available - there was a supercharged Miata at one of our autocrosses recently that ran and sounded great.  Even so, most of the Miatas I've seen are bone stock - and the drivers always seem to be smiling.<br><br>
