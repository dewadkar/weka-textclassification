            This is a repost of an article I posted elsewhere that apparently was the wrong place.

This fall, I had the opportunity to visit the Himalayas for nearly        three weeks on a custom trip with my mother. My mother is an avid photographer, but I am new to photography. So, I spent several hours researching digital cameras. I made my final decision to purchase a DC280 and received it several days before I left on my trip. Based upon articles and reviews of digital cameras I also purchased a 24 meg flash memory card AND a PCMCIA adaptor card. <i>(Please read some of my travel reviews. Bhutan and Sikkim were from this year and China, Tibet and Mongolia were from 1999)</i>

This combination was perfect! The PCMCIA card with the flash memory installed is looked at like another hard drive on my computer and data transfers to and from it are blazingly fast! Now back to my camera experience.

  I took about 600 shots during the course of the trip and made good use of the rechargeable batteries (included) and the initial long life non-rechargeable batteries (also included) That was a nice touch. ALL the cables were included with this camera; USB, serial AND video out cable) Of course, the battery charger was included as well.

The camera took very good photos both inside and out and I thought the battery life was quite good. I generally took between 100 and 150 pictures before having to recharge. With a second set of rechargeable batteries I was home free!

Photo quality was excellent...sunrises and sunsets both came out stunningly AND both internal and external shots also turned out quite nice.

One drawback I found with this camera is the zoom capability. I think, when I purchase my next digital camera in a year or so, I'll look for better zoom and possibly even for changeable lenses. Other than this one drawback, I thought the camera was a great purchase at under $400 online.<br><br>
