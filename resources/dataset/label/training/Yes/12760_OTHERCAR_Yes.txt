            I got my FujiFilm MX-2700 for Christmas, and I haven't put it down since.  I'm a very amatuer photographer that loves to take pictures, and this camera is perfect for me.  I can snap over 100 pictures, on the 8MB Smart Media card that is standard in the camera, instantly preview them, keep the good ones, and dump the bad ones.  

The camera is very easy to use.  The &quot;dial&quot; type function selector makes it very easy to switch from different camera functions.  You can go from playback to photo mode in one easy turn of the dial.  One more turn and your ready to export your pictures to your computer.

With two different picture sizes and three different photo qualities, there is enough range for the camera to be perfect for amatuers and professionals both.

The camera interfaces with a computer very well.  All you need to do is plug into a serial port, load the software, and your ready to go.  

Overall, I love the MX-2700.  I've taken hundreds of pictures and haven't paid one cent for developing.  It has wonderful photo quality, a large memory, and very user-friendly controls.
