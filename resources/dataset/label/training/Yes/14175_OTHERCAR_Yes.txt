            Without a doubt, my 2000 Plymouth Grand Voyager is the best purchase I have ever made. I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone with a growing family. My husband and I were looking for a larger vehicle to tote around our three children. 

After looking at many minivans, the Plymouth Grand Voyager had exactly what we wanted at the best price. We chose the Grand because it has more room for strollers, luggage, groceries, etc. behind the back seat and more leg room for back seat passengers. 

The duel sliding doors are the best invention ever. I am able to put my toddler in her car seat with ease on the driver side. I don't have to listen to &quot;she's touching me,&quot; or &quot;she won't stay on her own side of the seat,&quot; from my girls. 

The back seat holds three and the middle seat holds two, so you don't have to climb over the middle seat to get to the back seat as in older minivans, when the back seat held two and the middle seat held three. The middle seat will come out and the back seat can be moved forward, so we can still travel with all three kids and have additional room in the back. 

However, the middle seat can not be moved to the back. Of course, it uses more gas than our previous car and with gas prices the way they are, it takes about $25 to fill it up, but it is definitely worth it to have the extra room and comfort. 

Again, I would recommend the Plymouth Grand Voyager to anyone looking to expand to a larger vehicle.<br><br>
