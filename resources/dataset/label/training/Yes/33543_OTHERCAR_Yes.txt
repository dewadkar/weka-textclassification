            The Beetle has been one of my dream cars since I was a kid, and when they came out with it again a few years ago, I decided I'd get one no matter what. How great was it, then, to find out that the cute little car was also a safe little car.

I've been buzzin' around in my 2001 Beetle for a month now and I've got no real complaints, although I suspect I'll be searching for shady parking spaces this summer due to the strong greenhouse effect in the sun--hot inside, even with my cream colored interior.

The car has the smoothest ride I've ever experienced in a compact, the controls are laid out with ergonomics in mind--I can change the radio stations and tape player without having to stretch or even look at the dash--and my mileage in stop-and-go traffic has been around 25 mpg. Overall, I couldn't be happier.
