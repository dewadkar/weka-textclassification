            Its been 20 months since I bought this car (Nov 98) and 26,000 miles later I still get the feel that I am driving this car out of the dealership for the first time. Back when I bought this car, it was the newest thing in the market. 1998 was the first year with the new look so by the time I was in the market for a new car, there weren't too many new Accords on the road. So I decided to test drive some new cars in under $20,000 range.  

I looked for Toyota Camry but by that time every one had a Camry. Besides, stick shift was only available in their base model. Mazda 626 came out with a newer model but it did not have a very good feel on the road. Nissan Altima was too small and its 5-speed stick shift wasn't smooth. Besides the feel of the car, each one of them were missing something or another. Accord was the only car that satisfied everything for me and provided the complete package that I need for just the right price. It had a stick shift for its EX model! I went with regular interior (non-leather) because I did not want to put the price out of my range. After all I had to pay taxes too.

I test drove Accord EX from three different dealerships. That helped me negotiate the price to sub $20,000 level. I lived in upstate NY and roads there are horrible. I have lived there for four years and this car provided the smoothest ride I have ever had. 

I thought about buying the coupe but there was hardly any price difference. People told me that coupe is better because it is cheaper and smaller. I checked the facts. It is slightly cheaper (actually same price for what I paid for EX sedan) and it isn't smaller. If anything the coupe has a sporty look, but that is it. I could use two extra doors.

My family came down to visit me a few months later and they were blown away by its price and performance. Since then, my brother bought an Accord and my sister (recent college grad) also bought one. 

When my sister was in the market of buying a new car (Feb 2000), she started with Acura, BMW 3-series, Audi A4 and Passat. She couldn't afford anything in $20,000+ range. She loved BMW but it was out of her price range. Then she drove Accord 2000. She was instantly sold.

I have made many 300+ miles trip on this car, longest of which was from NY to TX (driving distance 2,100 miles on the route I took). The car was fully loaded because I was relocating. I drove through the snow storms of Buffalo, NY never loosing control of the car. Those anti-lock brakes were extremely helpful. The ride was excellent even with the tremendous amount of luggage I was transporting. It took me three and a half days but I never got tired of sitting on the driver seat (non-leather seats). These seats cushion you very well and provide a good back support. The entire trip gave me a 32 mpg mileage. 

Of course, if you take good care of your car, it is going to take good care of you. I have performed regular oil changes as well as tire rotations every other oil change. After 26,000 miles, I do not have any complaints with the car. In Texas where roads are in much better condition, I sometimes push the speed to beyond 90 mph and sometimes even 100 mph. There is absolutely no feeling about how fast you are going on these straight roads. The engine isn't noisy at high speed and you have the same solid feel of the car. Suspension and road grip is awesome.

Now when I recommend this car to my friends they say that everyone else has an Accord. Well, I don't have to explain any further for the reason of its popularity. Go out and notice how many Accord owners are out there. I am not going to speculate but I think Accord is the reason Saturn LS isn't selling very well.
