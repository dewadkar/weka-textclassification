             I purchased this camera as a gift for myself.I comparison shopped for quite some time before making this decision.
  The first thing you notice is that it is slightly heavier than other cameras, the second is how sleek this little guy looks! The picture quality is excellent in every situation..indoor/outdoor/high light/low light/up close it just doesn't matter the quality of the picture was never even affected!! Crystal clear and comforting to know that anything you point the came "turn out".
  Camera is  MP and stores 80 photos at the highest resolution!!!! Battery life is rather limited and a bit pricey at just under a cool grand, but well worth it to FINALLY have a digital camera of this high quality.
   Instruction booklet is rather long winded and repetitive at times but I have not run across a problem that I could not solve simply by reading it.
