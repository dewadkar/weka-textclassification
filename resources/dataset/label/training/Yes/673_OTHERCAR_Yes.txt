            I purchased the 950 after reading a series of very positive reviews out on the market.  Most of these reviews were from professionals extolling the features and power of the camera.  What I missed during my research were reviews from novices and semi-pros.  So consider this a review from a person who knows photography, but isn't going to be giving lessons or selling his work any time soon. 

Pros:
- The camera is packed full of features.  You can adjust just about every setting imaginable from a relatively easy to use menu on the camera.
- It is easy to get started.  I was up and running in about 5 minutes, and was taking more complex pics after spending an hour or so with the manual.
- Amazing resolution and picture quality.
- It takes additional lenses, like a wide-angle, fish-eye, and telephoto

Cons:
- Red eye is a pain.  You end up taking the pictures before you think to put red eye reduction on, and by then it's often too late.  The solution, I think, is to just get good with Photoshop.  
- The memory is too low.  I would recommend getting a 64 MEG chip.
- The fact that they even bother to give you non-rechargeable batteries is just plain silly.  You must get rechargeables.
- The display is nearly impossible to see in any sort of direct sunlight.
- The flash is weak.  Don't expect decent flash pics from a distance.
- Flash card slot is a little hard to use and not too secure.
- It annoys me that the display shuts off so quickly (to save battery).

Purchasing:
- Check for best prices from CNET.
- I bought from Worldwide Direct (CNET lists as BuyDig ...?) in NY, and was quite happy with them.  They were gruff New Yorker types, but they really knew the camera, shipped and billed promptly, and gave some good purchase advice.  They did push a little hard for the extended warranty, but gave in after I said no about 5 times.
- Worldwide Direct has a Super Accessory Kit that I recommend.  It gets you what you need for the camera, namely the 64 MEG memory, rechargeable batteries, flash card reader, and then makes you really happy because you get a nice wide angle and telephoto lens in addition to some other stuff.<br><br>
