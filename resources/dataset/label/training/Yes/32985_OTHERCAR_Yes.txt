            I am currently driving a 1997 Toyota Camry that I love for many reasons.  The main reason is a similar car saved my life.  Three years ago while driving a 1995 Camry, I hit ice and lost control of the car, hitting a metal barrier head on at sixty-two miles per hour.  The car turned one hundred eighty degrees, crossed two lanes of traffic, and while going in reverse hit a concrete barrier.  I say out load, &quot;God, help me&quot;, placed both feet on the brakes and managed to park the car at the side of the road after blowing three of the four tires.  I walked away from this wreck with two compression fractures in my back.  The state patrolman who stopped to investigate said how rare it was for the seat back to remain intact during a head on collision.  It was what prevented greater injury.
When my husband asked what I wanted for a new car, I didn't need to do any research or even think.  A Toyota Camry, same color, same interior but with a spoiler for good looks.  We have loved both cars and will buy a third Camry in the future.  I feel safe and I also know I look good in this car.<br><br>
