            the overwhelming power aside, this is one smooth handling car. whether you slam on the pedal or you take it easy of the red light, this car is nothing but awesome. it makes one heck of a sports car, even in the v6package, and it makes one nice sleek luxury car. whether you are a blue collared power/speed hungry maniac, or a conservative suit &amp; tie corporate, this is the car you gotta have. TRUST ME.
The Pontiac Firebird still has the occult following that was popular back in the 70's. i USED to be a ford guy but since i drove my first F-BODY (camaro/firebird) i have changed. the power that a new v8 mustang can do can be easily met by a v6 fbody (camaro/firebird). i know that for a fact. a good friend of mine paid 18k for a 94 'stang convertible. while my brother paid 8k for a 95 firebird v6. i tune up both cars with exact products. Accel ignition components, k&amp;n filters and ram air. the 'stang with the last 5.0 302ci. cannot keep up with the 3.4L 207ci. that the firebird has. as for comfort there is a huge difference. while i must admit that the new f-body's can do better with rear seat comfort, the mustang is just horrible. leg space is almost non-existence. for front seat, on the firebird there are two different feelings.
1. The true feeling of being on the cockpit of a true muscle car. the steering is nice and smooth yet it feels aggressive.
2. It is the most comfortable car i have ever been in. the seats are molded to the human contours.
