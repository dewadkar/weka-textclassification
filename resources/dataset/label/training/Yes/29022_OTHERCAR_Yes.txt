            The Honda CR-V is the best car in this great world. I have this car and this car is worth every single penny that you spend on it. The technology in the car is amazing. This technology provides luxury and safty. With air bags and a strong frame, the car is extremely safe. The seat adjustment system, steering wheel adjustment system, aerodinamic air conditioning system, and a comfortable ride all add to the greatness of my favorite car, the Honda CR-V. This car comes in many different color combinations. The car, also, has many avalible options. Some of the options are a CD player, rear tire cover, sun or moon roof, global positioning system, and leather. As you can see, this is a fabulous car.
