            The Honda CRV LX 2002 has been redesigned for 2002, which is a good thing since I and my wife would not have considered looking at it with the old body shape. The old CRV looked frail and weak, where the 2002 has inproved in look and in horse power. We have been shopping for a SUV for the past six months but could not decide what to buy. We were looking at the Mazda Tribute, the Toyota Highlander. But then the Honda came along and it fit our needs quite nicely.The Tribute was a nice car but it's a Mazda/Ford and I just did't trust the quality. The Toyota was way too expensive if you got the v6 with some amenities it was close to $ 30,000, and I just didn't feel it was worth the money. The CRV looks very nicely. The designers at Honda have done a nice job with both the interior and exterior.
The exterior is  more agressive looking with nice lines and a clean look. The size of the car itself is just right, small enough to fit in most parking spaces with an interior
that is very roomy for our suv needs.The interior is very well thought out. The lx model comes with most anything one would need. Everything is power and a fair amout of cubby holes throughout  the car. One complain  is that the cubby hole just below the radio doesn't fit a cd case, of course
the cubby hole near the floor does.
We purchased the Automatic LX version, which I have to say has just enough power for most city and highway driving. However when going up long hills, such as mountain driving, the engine seems to be working overtine. It would have been nice to have given the CRV at least an optional v6 with more hores power. The 160 hp that is has is sufficient, but maybe in future models.The crv drives very much like a taller car, very smooth and with little noise except on
unpaved roads. The front seats are very comfortable while the back seats would accomodate 3 kids or two adults very nicely.The trunk is very large for a smallish SUV, and I really don't get the picnic table idea, but it comes with one.
Next year my wife and I will be in the market for another car/suv and if Honda does come up with a v6 version we might possibly buy another.I have had an Acura Integra for the past 12 years, and I've never had any major problems with it, which was another reason why we looked at Honda product.I trust the brand to hold up very well and to hold it's value over the years.
