            After owning an Isuzu Rodeo for almost five years, we decided to go for a larger SUV model. We looked into several other models and decided to test drive the Durango. The test drive alone was the biggest reason we decided to purchase the Durango. It is very comfortable, ALMOST too much so. With the CD player included in our package the very comfortable seats, and the even and smooth ride I just have to make sure that I concentrate on my driving and not the mood. The biggest difference between the Rodeo and the Durango is that the Rodeo rides more like a car and I'm guessing because of the size that the Durango rides more like a truck. The drivers seat sits higher but this gives you a better view of the road. At first I thought the price was high, but after driving it for more than a month now, I will say it was worth every penny. I suggest that if you decide to buy one, don't get a stripped down model. Go for it all. It is well worth it.<br><br>
