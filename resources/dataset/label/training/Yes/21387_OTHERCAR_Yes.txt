            I've owned Toyota before, so when my wife and I were in the market for a new car we wanted Toyota.  Toyota offers the reliability of the Japanese made cars without the expense of Honda cars.  The Camry is no different.  I own the LE model with the four(4) cylinder engine and minimal extras.  It is a joy to drive.  Smooth and peppy acceleration with descent handling.  The stock tires are some what poor, but they'll do.

On the negative side is the styling.  The Camry used to have a &quot;big car&quot; feel and look in mid size package.   Now it is looking it's &quot;size&quot;.  The exterior design is nice, but doesn't really make me take notice (except for the fact that everyone else is driving one).  The interior has a cheap feel to it and some of the molding is off color.

In general, the Camry is a good car at the price.  More importantly there is no beating the dependability of a Toyota!!!

By the way, try staying away from the Champagne color, it's the most popular one.<br><br>
