            Why buy this camera? Because of the quality and clarity! You cant beat the price. I bought my camera about 3 months ago and Love it! Its ease of use and features have made my friends go out and buy one. If you look around you can find the camera with a bag and recharger for $299.00, unfortunatly I did find that deal.  I think Walmart was where my friend found her camera with those extras.  I found the LCD is a great feature but I dont use it as much as first.  Cant see it outside and it drains the batteries quickly.  I did purchase a recharger for the batteries which helps a great deal.  I wish the camera came with a zoom but it hasnt made me miss a great pic.  The camera comes with a timer, red eye reduction, optional settings, flash, and software. The size is perfect, not to small like the c2020 and not to big like the kodak.  I shopped around and compared and I havent found anybody beat the clarity of an olympus! I think having a great photo printer helps termendously. I bought a p1000 hp! look at epinions for that! Another great price for what you get!   I bought a 16 mb card cause the 8mb it comes with is too small for taking trips, you will use up that quickly.  You can buy a card for $60 but ebay sells them for 20 bucks.  I rate this camera an A. Not too much negative to write about.  Just Compare!! You will be surprised with this great camera (digital).<br><br>
