            I've been dying for a digital camera for years, and an online friend picked up a little $50 Vivitar at Wal-Mart that took AWESOME pics.  I researched it online, and while doing so the Vivitar 3615 caught my eye; my husband and I decided that we should "splurge" and get the more expensive model.  We haven't regretted it since.  It takes very clear pics in either high or low resolution mode (although I can't really tell the difference); in low res mode you will be able to take more pics before uploading them.  The manual says it can hold around 86 pics; but when we took pics of the fireworks on July 4, I had over 130 in the camera!!  And that's without any additional storage card!!  Pictures upload quickly, and you have the option of selecting/changing your file for uploading to; you can also have the computer delete the pics from the camera once they're uploaded.  The LCD viewscreen is very clear; the only problem I have with it is that it gets in the way of my nose when I'm trying to use the viewfinder, so I end up either cleaning the screen after each picture or holding my head at an awkward angle while I'm taking pictures.

The batteries don't seem to last too long, but being rechargeables I expected that.  I invested in an additional set of batteries and a rapid charger (total cost: $30), so I always have a fully charged set on hand, plus a pack of alkalines in case of emergency.  Once in a while, if the camera is jarred too hard the batteries will shift and cause the camera's time/date settings to reset.  I also get the occasional blurry pic, but that's user error, not camera defect.

The flash works very well, almost TOO well in many conditions.  I was playing with my 6 YO daughter, and took a picture of her in a completely dark room; the flash made it appear that she was in a well-lit room!!  Often I get pics where my subject (usually my cats) are washed out because it's too bright; but I get enough good-quality pics that I can overlook the few bad ones!

Overall, I would highly recommend this camera, whether you're a first-time digital buyer or on a budget.  I do plan on getting a different one in the future, hopefully with video-camera mode; but I assure you, I will not get rid of this one.  I have already saved hundreds of dollars on film; this camera pays for itself in a short period of time.  It's wonderful!
