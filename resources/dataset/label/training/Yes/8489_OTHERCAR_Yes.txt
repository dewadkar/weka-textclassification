            This is my first real digital camera and I have to say I'm very impressed. First of all I have to say that I wanted a first quality digital camera with optical zoom and at least a 2 megapixel and I only had a little over a hundred dollars to spend. As you all know that's not very much to spend. I was shopping online and on ebay and I read about this camera in a review. I was very impressed by the things that were said about it. I just so happened to go to walmart one saturday and they had one of these left, still in the box, brand new on clearance for $130. I snatched it up quickly! It's definately a great camera. I was amazed at the picture quality this little camera has. I've owned it for over 2 weeks now and love it more every day. Absolutely a great little camera for the money. Comes with 2 nimh batteries and charger. I was very surprised at how long the camera goes on a single charge, especially if you dont use the lcd very much. I've only charged my batteries a couple of times and I've taken LOTS of pictures. It also comes with a 16 meg smartmedia card included. It holds quite a few pictures before having to download them to the pc. I bought a 128 smartmedia on ebay for around 25 bucks shipping included. Smartmedia is cheap and that's good for those of us on a tight budget. I'm no camera enthusiast or photographer so I can't offer much in the way of technical info or advice but I would definately recommend this camera to others who want a good affordable digital camera that takes great pictures.
