            I have recently purchased DAEWOO Nubira. I have driven about 3500 km.
The reason why I purchased the car is first the excellent price, the best payment plan in Bulgaria, excellent design and the recommendations of the clerk in the DAEWOO shop.
The car has altogether good performance. It is easy to drive and pretty comfortable and silent. It has a lot of options - A/C, ABS, power windows, power steering, cup holder, power mirrors, stereo, car alarm that are OK. It has a big trunk and is spacious inside.
The biggest problem is the engine.
At the time of my purchase only cars with 1600 cm3 engines were available in the shop. I was assured that this engine is perfect for the car and it is no use to wait months on end for bigger engine at a bigger price.
Besides fuel in Bulgaria is expensive and normally lower cm3 mean lower fuel spending.
I was bitterly disappointed. The engine 1600 cm3 is weak for the car.
It spends a lot of fuel - 11 liters and more per 100 km in the city (I had had a MAZDA 626 2000 cm3 that was spending 10 liters per 100 km!).
The engine has problem with ignition at temperatures below 0oC. And in the DAEWOO service assured me that it was normal for engines with injection!
When you push the gas pedal the gear changing lever moves in your hand and from time to time the inclination is several centimeters. And again in the service they said it was normal and that it does not exist in the 2000 cm3 versions!
The car was sold with a one year guarantee. On the 15th day the light in the inside went out and they refused to change it for free! This expense is insignificant but what happens if I have larger problem!
