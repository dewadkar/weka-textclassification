            I needed a camera that would satisfy both my business and personnel needs.  Sony's MVC-FD83 definitely filled both!  Rarely have I purchased something where two months later I can still say that the purchase feels as good now as when I took it out of the box.  The camera is easy to use, easy on batteries (I have gone a month between recharging my battery), and really easy to find film for, it uses floppy disks.  Most importantly the picture quality is just what I hoped for when I decided to replace my trusty old 35mm with a digital camera.  I also really liked the camera's sound effect, like a &quot;real&quot; SLR.  The flash is unbelievable, taking pictures in almost pitch dark conditions with seemingly no problem.  Also, the ability to take short movies is really appreciated.  On that end the sound quality is almost as good as the picture.  On the down side, the camera strap is kind of flimsy and there is no really good place to attach the lens cap to when the camera is in use.  Also the software that Sony provides is kind of poor.  But those &quot;downers&quot; are overshadowed by the camera itself.<br><br>
