            This is quite the little car. Its handling if anything beats the (legendary) RX-7 whose space it has taken in my garage, and on slick surfaces the Subaru is simply amazing (best I�ve ever driven). Front seat and driver�s ergonomics are basically perfect, thought the back seat is in the same league with my last car (almost non-existent), and rear seatbacks do not fold down into the trunk. Pretty much the only way to carry anything bulky is on the roof. 

The 2.5 liter four-cylinder engine won�t frighten Corvettes, but it�s faster than most little cars on the road. Ample torque makes it very easy to drive: Combined with glued-to-the-road traction, all-wheel discs, 4-channel ABS, excellent weight distribution, fine suspension, and sticky tires, the little Subaru is the most forgiving car I have ever driven. I say this having taken it through many twisty back roads, and on occasion traveling at  triple-digit speeds. It doesn�t drift as easily as the RX-7, but the comfortable margin of error is far wider. 

Rain, ice, and snow are the Subaru�s forte, and in this environment it excels. The manual transmission RS in particular has negligible slip in its traction control, helping it run dead-on even where one side is on ice or in water. Agile handling and extra margin of control makes for an excellent driver experience. Of course, even the most nimble little car can still only offer limited protection from other drivers, especially those in gigantic sport utility vehicles that might weigh two or three times as much as the Subaru. Anywhere in the Subaru is a frightening place to be when you see a Suburban or Expedition come sliding your direction out of control. My first winter had one such close call that I barely was able to maneuver away from: The next one is always my great fear.  

PS - The build quality is excellent, but it�s not a �dead quiet ride� as defined by this site. Often the worst cars are very quiet just because they have so much sound-deadening material to cover up their poor quality. This Subaru has excellent components and perfect fit: that�s quality. The boxer engine is raspy, but any sound it makes passes quickly and is gone in the distance.
