            I bought the Finecam S5 for a camera to keep with me in my pocket, and it has excelled for this use.  I believe Yashica makes these cameras for Kyocera, and, in my opinion, they have done a fine job.  I've used a couple or three digital cameras, and the control layout and menu on this one are the best I've encountered.  Whenever I want to adjust any aspect of taking pictures, I can do so in seconds.  It's small, fits easily in my pocket, and has never accidentally started as a result of my keeping it there.  When I want to take a picture, I depress the shutter release button part way, and it takes about a second to give me a green light.  Once I have the green light, I can wait for a while (and it's easy to keep the button depressed that amount) before taking a picture, and the instant I depress the shutter all the way, it snaps the picture.  It does take a few seconds to get ready for the next picture, especially at higher resolutions.  If the camera is kept motionless, and the subject is in good focus, the 5 MP pictures are very sharp at the pixel level and suitable for blow-up. The AC cord for the charger isn't the outlet hogging wall wart type.  The DC power converter (which can live equally with American or European voltages and frequencies) has a socket for the almost universal computer power cord, and one such cord with a plug for an American 110V socket at the other end is supplied.
A few shortcomings are:  Sometimes I think the resolution of the digital control of the lens (the zoom and the focus adjustment) could be finer.  However, the small lens guarantees enough depth of field to allow for any small inaccuracy of focusing, and the zoom increments don't require much movement of the camera at all between one and the next. It only saves in Jpeg format, there is no option to save in raw format.  Also, it didn't come with a driver that works for Win XP.  I'm getting along fine with no driver at all as my laptop has a built-in SD card slot, so I can just pop the card in and drag and drop the picture files with Windows Explorer.  I believe this would work the same way with a usb or pcmcia sd card reader.  As with any tiny lens, there's no real way to limit depth of field.  It has two aperture priority settings at f2.8 & f9.6.  But, at 2.8, background objects are still in focus, and at 9.6 you need to turn on long exposure mode (and use a tripod unless you're looking for motion blur) to keep pictures taken indoors (even in a well - lit room) from appearing dark.  I don't imagine any with a lens diameter small enough for the camera to be ignorable in your pocket will perform very differently.  Movie mode automatically stops, even with a big SD card, but the camera has NTSC video out, so I can use it to record video of any length by hooking that up to my laptop or a vcr.  It would be really nice if it came with an extra battery and if the power converter was a little larger and had a slot to hold the other battery and act as an external charger.
