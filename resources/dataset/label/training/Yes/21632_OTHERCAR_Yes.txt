             I own a 1990 Volkswagen Vanagon GL. It has a 2.1 liter water cooled engine. I bought it at 105,000 miles for $4200 and now it is at 159,000. Some repairs were necessary, but overall I have truly enjoyed the vehicle.  It has a great deal of space inside and can seat seven. With the ability to put the back seat down and fold the middle seats forward, it can carry a lot more than vans that cost three times the amount. The rear area can also double as a comfortable bed..
 Unlike past VW vans, the late model Vanagon has many advanced features such as power steering and air conditioning. The air conditioning works well in the summer, but I had mine converted over to 134a, yours may vary.
  Derived from the design of the original Beetle air cooled Type I engine, the water cooled 2.1 liter engine provides enough power to get the vehicle around town comfortably . The top speed is about 76 mph but can be a little slow on the first 15 mph. It handles well and feels natural to drive and park. I bought it for the the size but I love it for the tight German feel of the vehicle. 
 The engine can be sensitive to wear, so regular oil and filter changes are a must. I use a 5w-50 weight synthetic oil to allow for rapid warm ups without giving up the heavier protection needed for the engine at higher speeds.
 Head leaks can be common with these vehicles and can be a pricey repair from $2000 up. If you have some mechanical experience, there is a large support group on the vanagon mailing list out there that can help you do it yourself for less. 
 The vehicle is heavy and is supposed to have class C tires on it. I have been running regular passenger car tires, but it is not recommended.
 WARNING: Some non VW repair places will have little idea how to diagnose and repair the Vanagon. Stick to shops that have worked with VW Vanagons regularly.
  Do get this vehicle if you are handy with repairs and need an affordable vehicle that can easily change between hauling people and cargo. Don't get this vehicle if you want jack rabbit starts and do not want to do your own maintenance work.
