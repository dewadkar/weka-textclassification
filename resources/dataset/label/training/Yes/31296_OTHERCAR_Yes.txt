            Although this car would not be my #1 choice for myself, my mom has one and loves it.  With 4 kids, a husband, and 2 dogs, she has a lot to carry around.  This car has plenty of room and cargo space.  It has enough room for 6 passengers (if you squeeze a little) and room for tons of cargo in the back compartment.  We can fit enough luggage for all of us, including ski and snowboard equipment for a two week vacation.  Thats 6 people and tons of luggage.  It offers many nice extras like power windows, sun roof, power seats, and a good sound system.  It drives very smoothly.  One problem is that it is expensive to fix.  I know from experience. It is sturdy though, and does not get messed up very easily.  <br><br>
