            The Pontiac Firebird is not only a powerful muscle car but it's sleek styling and elegance combine to make it a very fashionable luxury car. 
They are reasonably priced between $16,000(basic model) and $30,000(the top-of-the-line, everything added, formidable &quot;Ram Air&quot;)and well worth every penny!

The interiors are not only stylish, but very comfortable and functional as well. The car is equipped with an excellent sound system. The body style is the epitome of sports car, very sleek and very sexy and the ride is smooth. The maintenance on these cars is very minimal, usually limited to an oil change every three months, the occasional transmission service and (in extreme temperatures) belt changes. The engine needs a tune up every 100,000 miles. The only problems I have ever had with this type of car were the power window motors in the 1996 model. They were covered by warranty but went out about once a year.

I have been a proud owner of Firebirds since 1992 and each year, they just keep getting better. <br><br>
