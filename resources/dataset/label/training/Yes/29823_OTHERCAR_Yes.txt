            All in all I think this is a great little car.  We have one in our family that is my Mother's primary car and it was also the car that my ex-girlfriend drove.  In short, if you want a reasonably priced car that has ample power for its size, comfortable and reliable, go ahead and feel good about getting this vehicle.

The Prizm reminds me of a Toyota Corrola.  It may not be as big as a Camry or an Accord but certainly has that feel.  Essentially you know that you are in a smaller car but feel as though you have plenty of room.  That's a good feeling for an age that relishes the economy of space.  Also, the interior is very nice once you get to the second level of the vehicle.  It is plush and very comfortable.  You feel like you have luxury in a car that doesn't cost so much to get it.  There is plenty of leg and head room for a small car and has many simple and useful amenities to keep you happy.

In the sense of power and quickness, I think that the Prizm performs well.  If you get the larger 1.8 engine you will have enough power to get anywhere.  This is not like a truck where you need tons of torque to haul heavy stuff around nor a sports car where you need real speed in quickness.  It simply has enough juice to get from place to place in plenty of time.  Even with the automatic transmission, you have enough stuff to get onto a freeway in fine style.

Price was definitely a plus when this vehicle came out.  During its first years, I really feel that this car was one of the best values on the market.  Of course cars have gotten more expensive because of interest rates and so forth but it still seems to hold value.

Once again, if you want a comfy compact car with a stocky engine and a smooth ride, go ahead and make the choice.
