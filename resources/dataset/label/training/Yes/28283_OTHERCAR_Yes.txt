            Desperately hoping to get out of the mini van market but needing to be able to seat at least 6 occasionally, my wife and I searched all over for an SUV that wasn't the size of a tank.  We were all ready to settle for another mini van when I suggested we check out the Durango.  One minute behind the wheel sold my wife on it.  It has power, style and handling.  I would highly recommend a Durango to anyone wanting to ride in style.  Gas mileage is quite another story.  The ONLY thing I can find to say bad about our Durango is the 15mpg mileage.  Other than that it is the best vehicle I have ever had. It has an outstanding turning ratio.  You can get in and out of any space from any direction.  Several times other drivers have commented on my ability to get into a parking space that didn't look makeable given the size of the vehicle.  The fold down third seat is quick and easy to use as well.  I can't say enough good things about it.<br><br>
