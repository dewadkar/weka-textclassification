            The product was exciting to me because I can take a picture and use it immediately. It can be reviewed on the screen and this allows you to get those once in a lifetime shots the way that you want. The movie option that allows a full minute of digital video was the key to my purchase. I have family all over the country and I now can include them in the fun of all the special family occasions when they happen. Floppies can be copied in the machine for multi use by all. The unit comes with a 90 minute battery, charger, software, free web storage&amp; video cable for your television. The unit is ready to go out of the box, making it a terrific gift (open it first to get the rest of the party).<br><br>
