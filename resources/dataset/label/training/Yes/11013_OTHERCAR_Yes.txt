            I test drove most of the minivans out there. Most of them are built on a truck frame, and drive like it. The Astro is built on a car frame. It has the fiberglass leaf springs in the back just like a corvette. Our first trip was 4800 miles across the USA and Canada without any problems. My wife is 5'2&quot; and I'm 6' even and we have no problem adjusting the seats or mirrors to the different levels we need. Also the Astro had 10 to 80 more horsepower than other vans. When we went over the Rockies and Tioga pass it was like driving an 8 cylinder. The kids have plenty of room in the back and with the roof rack we had tons of room to take all of our needs for a long trip. An other option that I have is 4 captian chairs and a bench in the back that can be easly removed for hualing. Hope you buy an Astro you'll be glad you did. Good driving. <br><br>
