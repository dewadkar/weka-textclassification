            I bought my four door Neon in May of '96- it was a '95 model that I got for a steal. It sat on the lot for more than a year in Podunk, Texas because no self-respecting cowboy would drive this (obnoxious) lapis blue squirt.  

I love it- I have used my Neon for both highway driving and in town commuting, and it has always performed up to my expectations.  Even the color has grown on me.  I can always find my bright car in a split second in a crowded parking lot because it seems to have a glowing halo of blue.

The gas mileage is great- about 27 city and 32 highway.  It has 35,000 miles and has required maintenance only.  It also has great acceleration compared to other cars in its class at the time (Protege, Escort, etc.).  It can fit four adults comfortably, though it does not accelerate nearly as well with a full load.

My only concern is the safety of driving such a small car.  Though it comes with dual airbags, the prevalence of indestructible SUVs on the road makes me nervous, and I hate to pass eighteen wheelers for fear they will squish me.

Overall, the Neon is a great value, and I recommend it for a first car or for those on a limited budget.<br><br>
