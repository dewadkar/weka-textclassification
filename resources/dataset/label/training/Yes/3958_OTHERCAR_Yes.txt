            <b>Background</b>

In May of 2000, we were forced to seek new and improved means of transportation, when Patsy, our untrusty '89 Mercury Sable finally died on us.
Since we live in Yonkers, and work in Manhattan, public transportation just would not get the job done.
So we looked at magazines, we looked online, and we narrowed our search down to Honda, Toyota, and, lastly, Saturn.
At this point, Saturn was only considered as a 'just in case' kind of alternative.

So, we called a cab and headed off into White Plains, on a rainy weekday afternoon, to purchase snazzy new wheels. The driver of our taxi managed to take a route that avoided any other car dealerships, and so when we saw the Saturn dealership appear out of the gloom, our decision seemed to be made for us.

Somewhat skeptically, we entered the showroom, and were immediately impressed with the floor model. Our salesman was patient, well-informed, and very helpful. All without being pushy. We test drove an SL model, but it didn't have the power or legroom that we were used to with the 3.8L V6 of the Sable.
So, Terry (our salesman at Saturn of White Plains) offered up the suggestion that perhaps we might be interested in taking a look at the new L-Series Saturn.

Well, we took one for a spin and were sold!

<b>Specs</b>

We got an LS2 with a white exterior, and beige cloth seats.

Standard for the 2000 LS2 was:

3.0L dohc V6 with 4-speed automatic transmission
Vented 4-wheel disc brakes
Dual front Reduced Force Air Bags
Dynamic side-impact protection
Daytime running lamps
A/C with cabin filter
80-watt AM/FM/CD & Cassette stereo system, with 8 speakers
60/40-split folding rear seat
Adjustable steering column
Dent resistant panels on the front fenders, doors, and      
             bumper
Saturn Security System (remote keyless entry, anti-lockout,              and content theft-protection
Power windows
Power door-locks
Cruise control
Power heated mirrors
Alloy wheels
Foglamps

Quite a lot of good stuff there, I think!

<b>The Nitty-Gritty</b>

All the options and fancy trimmings in the world will not make a bad car good. Thankfully, the options and trimmings only enhance the good feelings one gets from having bought a Saturn, particularly this model.
The engine is a deceptively potent affair. It is a V6 capable of putting out 182 horsepower. Saturn says it will go from 0 - 60 mph in 8.2 seconds (the Honda Accord takes 8.9 seconds). The fuel economy isn't too bad at at 20/26 miles per gallon(city/highway).

Driving this car is fun. It is quick and nimble, and responds directly to your wishes. The engine accelerates smoothly, and is as close to being quiet as anyone could want. Highway driving really shows off how good this engine and transmission are, as you find yourself cruising along effortlessly at speeds well in excess of New Yorks limits.
Then you apply the brakes to avoid getting that dreaded ticket, and you discover how well the 'autobahn' brake design works. A lot of this car was European-inspired, from the brakes, to the engine, to the dody design that was derived from the German-made Opel Vectra.

The handling of this car actually takes a while to get used to because it does not handle like most other US cars. The car tracks cleanly though turns, without much of the 'leaning' characteristic of many US autos. The brake-system and the suspension are setup almost identically to the original German design specifications. So most road surfaces are handled comfortably and quietly by the LS2, and having gone through a rather bitter winter season with this car, I am glad to be able to report that we never once got trapped in any depth of snow, even during our blizzards. The front wheel drive coupled with the very nice 15in. tires got us through every snowstorm to date.

The interior isn't the lap of luxury, but it is quite comfortable. The bucket seats are very comfortable, and legroom and headroom are pretty good. My wife and I are both around the 6-foot mark, and we have no problems with getting in and out of the car, nor do we ever get cramps from a confined cabin space.

There are numerous storage spaces and pockets to put things in, and (almost) 18 cubic feet of trunk space. The rear seats fold down so that larger,longer items can pass through from the trunk, and into the main cabin of the car. Good for hauling lumber if you needed to, I guess. Thus far, I have not actually had occasion to make use of this feature, but when I need it, I know i'll be glad to have it.

The driver's side window can lower with a single hit on it's button, and all windows can be operated or secured from the center console. Door switches are in each door panel, and there are Child-Safety Locks on the rear doors.

There are numerous reading/vanity lights throughout the car, and the legroom in the rear seats is more than adequate, even with both front seats pushed all the way back.

The A/C controls are simply laid out, and easy to use.

The stereo system easily defeats the 6-speaker Jensen set-up that was in our old Sable, with easy adjustments and very clean and clear sound.

<b>Nitpicks</b>

Our brand-new car came with a few flaws, mostly cosmetic, and one that I consider major. The cosmetic failings consisted of;

A loose interior panel that fell off. Saturn replaced it      just fine.

Driver's side mirror would not respond to it's control, and      therefore could not be adjusted. Saturn replaced the      whole defective unit at no cost, promptly.

The armrest that is the hinged lid for the center console        storage bin came off completely. Saturn is fixing that      on Monday.

The rear taillight array developed a strange crack after a      routine Saturn oil-change, a few months ago. saturn         replaced the whole assembly at no cost.

The major problem(for me) was:
     In August or September,2000, the A/C stopped providing      me with the chilled air that is essential to surviving      the 20 mile trip to work. Saturn is scheduled to fix      that also.

<b>The Wrap-Up</B>

All-in-all, we are very, very happy with our Saturn. It's a smaller car that feels and acts like a bigger one!
We have been constantly impressed with the attentiveness shown by Saturn to it's customers, and we are eagerly awaiting the debut of their entry into the SUV arena.

Very satisfied, with the car, the service, and the admiring looks our Saturn gets!
