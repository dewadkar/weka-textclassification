Now with that out of the way, I 'd like to say, that in general while driving down the road the truck handles nice. :) it is a very attractive vehicle.  The Mileage isn't great but it isn't too bad either.  in the last 3 years I've drivin her over 120,000 miles.  as far as maintenance goes, Yes, it needed some.  but nothing more than one should expect, oil changes every 3000 miles, tranny flush every 30,000 brakes every 20,000 Tires every 50,000, radiator flush right before winter every year.  all fluids checked and filled with every oil change.  Never really had any unforseen technical problems with the truck.  I am supposing that those who did, probably didn't take care of it.  Personally, I didn't fork 12 grand out to not take care of it.
I will say however, that when winter comes, ( this applies to us Yankees ) You'll want to keep a couple 50 lb bags of sand in the back, maybe a couple cinder-blocks too ... she'll get away from ya on slick roads if you let her.  In high winds, the cab shape is fine if you have the wind directly ahead of you or behind you but from the side, it'll feel as if mother nature wants to flip your truck, slow down alittle ;).  
For those who are flatulant, The Cab doesn't air out very easily, be warned. ;)
This truck does make a great utility vehicle, she'll haul her weight in cargo if you need to, and I have on several occasions, the engine is solid you just hafta remember to give it some love. let her warm up on cold days and don't fight her .... she'll last ya a long time. ;)
