            The BMW M3 (1995 model year and up) is one of the worlds most impressive vehicles. And as a used vehicle, the price makes it attainable by even those of us not blessed with a trust fund or family fortune. I'll state right off the bat that I have a love-hate relationship with mine, but before buying one, you must understand what the car and what it isn't.

Performance of the M3 is amazing. That fact is well stated in any of the hundreds of articles written about it. What the articles don't state is that to get the most performance out of it, there are a number of steps you should take. For example: The engine response is humbled by the programming of the fuel injection system. BMW needed to tame the engine a bit so it would pass emissions testing, but with an aftermarket &quot;chip,&quot; the engine really wakes up. Also, once the suspension wears after many miles, the car loses its handling edge, but new struts and shocks will bring it back to life. Tires make this car and it is hard to beat the stock Michelin Pilots, but using other tires can negatively effect the way the car rides and handles. The downside is that the stock tires are hard to get and very expensive ($255 each!).

My car has been plagued with a list of problems that shouldn't happen on a car of this level. All of the problems have been taken care of under warrantee, but they never should have happened in the first place. The things that I have had replace include the rear shock mounts, motor mounts, tail light assembly, trim pieces and a few other tidbits. As a result, I highly recommend getting the Certified Pre-Owned package from the BMW dealer or if you aren't buying from a dealer, get an aftermarket warrantee package.

If you buy the vehicle, realize that it is a high performance vehicle that can be driven everday, but it is not an everyday vehicle that can be driven in a high performance mode. There is a difference. The big wheels and tires follow the road and it can be a chore to drive. Granted, the 1995 and up M3's are a world different then the 1988-91 M3's (which were more strictly performance oriented). I like my car for what it is and I put up with its faults. I can drive the car everyday (and do), plus take it out to the racetrack for BMW Club driving events. Being able to do both with the same car is why I bought it. <br><br>
