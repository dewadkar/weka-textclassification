            This is not a tech oriented review...
I purchased this camera in hopes of decreasing the amount we spend on photo developing and I think that within 2 or 3 years it will.  I got this camera because the Fuji camera I had my eye on was on a 2 month back order.  I am very happy with this one and can�t imagine the Fuji being much better. The camera came with an 8 MB card.  I was pleased to receive a rebate of a 64 MB card as a rebate from Olympus, through Circuit City.  So far, I am very pleased with most aspects of the camera.  When I first began to use it, I found the programming and interface hard to use but with a little bit extra time in the manual; I picked it up quickly. The Camera takes excellent 8 X 10 inch photos on the highest memory setting.  I am excited with the fact that with the two 64 MB and one 8 MB card that I will be able to take between 200 and 800 photo�s on a trip depending on the quality setting.  The image transfer to my computer is fairly quick and has had no glitches.  The photo editing software is good (not professional by any means).  I am able to take multiple photos of my child and choose which ones to edit and print out on photo paper. *We are already out of picture frames in my home.  By the way, red eye reduction function on most photo editing software is about the best thing since sliced bread. One aspect of the camera is when one opens the sliding front shutter (which is not too easy to open) its possible to not open it 100% of the way and end up trying to snap pictures and have no action.  That glitch freaked me out a few times until I got used to it.  It�s a small glitch that most would probably overlook.

To wrap up this review, I would highly recommend this camera for good 8 X 10 photo quality prints.  It will outdo itself for the average user in family and small business use.  If you can arrange to get the 64 MB memory card rebate, then do so (it�s worth between $40.00 and $70.00).  The price of the camera is right and I personally feel very good about the Olympus name.  I wanted, but surely couldn�t afford, a comparable Sony Digital camera, so this is an excellent compromise.  My coworker wants a Sony but is timid about the price of one so I highly recommended the Olympus to him.
