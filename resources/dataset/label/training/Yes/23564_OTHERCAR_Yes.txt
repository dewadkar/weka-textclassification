            Today, my husband &amp; I traded for a '98 Chevy 1/2 ton extended cab, Cheyenne series.  Boy, I love it!!!!  It drives like a dream!!  If I didn't know better, I'd think I were driving a car except that I have the luxury of sitting up higher and being able to see over the vehicle beside me in the turning lane.  

This truck, for us, will be not only our main family vehicle but it also needed to be able to be &quot;used&quot; as well.  My husband &amp; I raise coonhounds so this truck needed to be able to accomodate a dog box in the back (which it more than does &amp; has plenty of room for his tool box as well) and it also needed to be capable of having muddy boots stepping in it without ruining the carpet.  Well, our truck has no carpet in the floor.  It has vinyl type flooring which is perfect for us.

It also does not have power windows.  For most, you would consider this a minus.  For me, this is ALSO a plus considering that the '96 Windstar van's (I just traded) driver's side window decided NOT to work ALL winter.  Imagine driving to the bank drive thru or grabbing a quick bite to eat &amp; not being able to roll down your window!  After several months of this, I welcomed the no power windows.  

It does have many options but is not what I would call loaded by any means but it is perfect for us.  It also came with a decked out security/ remote alarm system including remote start!!  What an awesome feature!!  We can have the truck start on a cold day while still inside staying warm, the doors lock so no one can steal it and then the climate control comes on &amp; adjusts the temperature in the cab!  How's THAT for service!!!  All in all, I believe we made a good trade &amp; best of all, the next time there's a weekend bench show for our dogs, we won't be deciding who goes &amp; who stays home because we can all jump in this truck &amp; load the dogs in the box in the back &amp; off we'll go!<br><br>
