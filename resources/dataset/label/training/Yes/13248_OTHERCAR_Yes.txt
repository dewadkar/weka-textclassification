            Fifteen days before I made my last payment on the Mazda Protege that was the first car I had ever really tried to take good care of, I totaled it. Man, I hated the task of looking for a new car!  Because I had really enjoyed that little car, and they are now rated so high, I first thought that I would simply replace it in like kind.  I am not sure what diverted my attention; perhaps it was my car-loving Russian engineer of a husband, who considered the situation an excellent excuse to test-drive every car in Austin, Texas. 

I have a son who will be thinking he should be allowed to take the car on Saturday nights just about the time I get this latest one paid for, so I wanted a dependable car that might survive a teen-aged driver, if it survives me long enough.  I vacillated between a &quot;good&quot; used car, such as a late-model Volvo or Lexis, and a &quot;pretty good&quot; new car, like an Accord or a Camry.  I had had a old Honda once, and it was a real trooper, was more-or-less donated to me and my ex- by his father after we graduated from law school, and it survived lots of neglect. I didn't think I could afford one, but I decided to try an Accord.  I bought a 1999 LX.

Even though that Accord cost darn near as much as my house, I think it is quite a bargain. We just drove it nearly 2,000 miles, to Tennessee and back, and we got exactly 30 miles per gallon, which is better than I did with my little Protege.  And this is a really big car!  We crammed clothes for three, presents for 25, a large cooler, bags of Mexican food, a library of books on tape and CD's, a skateboard and helmet, and lots of winter wraps in case we ran into a white Christmas into that car...there was so much stuff piled by the front door that I was sure we would have to rent a U-Haul, but when it was all in the car, we had room left over.   

The Accord LX has many wonderful features, such as fold-down back seats, as well as a little hole that can be made in the middle of the back seats to stick long skinny things through and still have seats for two.  The stereo sounds great, and there are lots of drink holders that really hold upright most any size of drink.  There are two separate compartments easily accessible to the driver between the front seats, and you don't have to upset your drink getting to them.  You really can read in the dark by the map lights, and the visors can actually be adjusted to keep the sun out of your eyes.  

The car is so easy to drive!  It has easy, smooth acceleration.  I thought at first that it was lacking in power, because I was so accustomed to really hearing the engine in my Mazda.  My Accord is so quiet that for a while I mistook the quietness for laziness, but it really is plenty powerful. The steering is...there is a car-lover's word for this but I don't know it...&quot;predictable&quot; is my best descriptor.  What I mean is that a smooth action at the steering wheel gives you a smooth result, so you don't have to keep making adjustments as you go around a curve.  After I got used to stopping a big car rather than a small one, I have always felt very good about the way it brakes.

There are two things I don't like about the car.  The painted bumpers are so soft that from the inside, driving it, you really can't &quot;feel&quot; that you have touched something with the bumper...the bumper just bends.  Well, not &quot;just bends&quot;...it bends, then whatever you touched undoubtedly puts a jolly-good scratch in the paint.  As you might have surmised, I am hard on a car, and I think it would be better for me to either have a black bumper with no paint, or a mighty-strong-bumper, like the chrome ones on pick-up trucks. To me, the bumper ought to be the strongest part of a car. 

The only other fly in the ointment is the fact that it seems to want me to &quot;rev it up&quot; when shifting through the gears.  I'm older than that now.  I want to just mosey along.  

Oh, one more thing...both my husband and I think that the seats could be more comfortable for long drives...maybe you should spring for lumbar support!  

But altogether it is a wonderful, commodious, dependable, quiet, economic car and I recommend it highly!             <br><br>
