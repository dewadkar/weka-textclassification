            I'm not a mini van person.  OK...let me rephrase that, I *wasn't* a mini van person. :o)  As the impending delivery of our second child approached, and our older Ford Explorer seemed to be needing more and more costly repairs, we actually considered buying the (somewhat) dreaded mini van.  My stereotypical life of a suburban mom with two kids was becoming a reality!

Much to my surprise, when we looked at a Grand Caravan SE on the lot I actually thought I could like the thing!  We had already ridden/driven the same model that friends/family owned - so we knew we liked the ride.  The best thing???  The SPACE!  Leg room galore, under seat storage and complete flexibility when it comes to seating (and removing the seats).  Not to mention the NUMEROUS (I can think of 8 off the top of my head) drink holders.  If you get a Dodge - you'll want the &quot;Grand&quot; - because it gives you plenty of room behind the third seat for storage (we've actually had our full sized Little Tykes wagon in there, plus stuff stacked up to the top for family celebrations).

The ride??  SMOOTH - it is just like driving a nice sedan (love my Hondas) only you are up high (which I love). No bouncing - not like driving a truck at all.  Dodge has definitely made this vehicle comfortable - this is what you want for those long family driving vacations!  Gas mileage is good for a van - but if you are used to a smaller car you might be in for a bit of a surprise as we get around 25 on the highway and just under that in town.

Some tips:  Go ahead and upgrade to a package with a bigger engine (sorry I don't know the details).  I feel very comfortable driving on Atlanta interstates with the power our Caravan has.

Splurge for the captains chairs when it comes to middle row seating.  Not only it is a *lifesaver* when you have two kids back there - adults feel a heck of a lot more comfortable too!<br><br>
