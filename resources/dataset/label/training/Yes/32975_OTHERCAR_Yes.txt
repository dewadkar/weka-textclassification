            In 1997, Toyota released the redesigned Camry in the United States.  The new model was very similar to the old, but there were a few distinct differences that completely changed the personality of the car.  Basically, it erased what little there was.

My step-mother owned a 5-speed '87 Camry and she absolutely loved it.  When it was time for a new car, the obvious choice for her was the new Camry.  She purchased a lightly-equipped LE model.  It was not long before she missed her old Camry.

The '97 Camry is a very easy and comfortable car to drive.  The controls are all placed logically and the displays are all very clear and well positioned.  The seats are comfortable enough and there is plenty of space, even in back.  The car is also very reliable.  There is also practically no engine or wind noise inside the cabin. The gas mileage is good and the snow traction is more than adequate for suburban Boston winters.  However, not everything about the car is ideal.

Changes between this generation ('97-and the previous ('92-'96) include adjustment to the suspension.  My step-mother describes the handling as being like "driving a limo".  My mother's '94 Camry handles better on city streets than any car I have driven to date.  The steering gives a very large level of control and enough road feel to inspire confidence in tight maneuvers.  In an effort to provide a more comfortable and "refined" ride, the '97 Camry has a less tight suspension.  As a result there is more body-roll and the handling, while still better than most cars, is less appealing.  The steering is a bit too heavy and the brake pedals also require just a little bit too much force.

The largest disparity between the '97 and the previous model comes as a result of 100 pounds of extra weight.  This extra weight makes a difference in terms of power since 130hp does not provide much surplus.  There may not be a significant difference in acceleration between the two models, but the newer Camry just feels slower.  These few problems with the Camry provide a boring ride.

The '97 Toyota Camry is a very nice car for everyday use and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for good reliable basic transportation.  The looks are not great but not bad either.  The handling is subdued but far from bad.  Practically everything about the car is nice, but nothing is outstanding.  Nothing is "fun".
