            Got a long commute to work?  Here is an absolute gem!!  When a move forced me to live 115 miles from work,  I decided to I needed an absolutely perfect commuter car. I got a '98 Jetta Diesel (TDI).

I love the fuel economy, first and foremost.  I don't quite get the 50+ mpg claimed by some, but I'm not complaining about a consistent 47 mpg on the highway.  The typically perceived problems with a diesel engine-- the noise and the lack of performance-- are all but nonexistent with this car.  If either the fan is running on high, or the radio is turned on to a reasonable volume,  the engine cannot be heard with the windows rolled up, thanks to good VW soundproofing.  The 90hp engine is just slightly outperformed by its gasoline counterpart, but still quite up to the task of aggressive highway merging.  The vehicle has that tight German steering and suspension, and hugs turns admirably.  FUN TO DRIVE!

Research indicates that VW has only been making the current type of TDI engine since 1996.  My concern was its reliability.  Diesel engines generally do very well in this category, but 4 years is not a long track record.  If you consider buying this car I would stay on top of all required maintenance.  Diesel repair is expensive.  You do take a chance then, in my opinion, when you purchase a diesel.  I think however, that the risks are far outweighed by the benefits. PREDICTED RELIABILITY.

Lastly, if you are worried about finding diesel fuel in your area, start looking around highway exits, I think you will be pleasantly suprised.
And with ~700 miles per tank with the TDI, you shouldn't have any problems getting to the pump.  With this in mind, if you have a long highway commute, definitely consider the JETTA TDI.  GREAT CAR.

**don't just take my word for it, there are entire clubs full of happy TDIers online!**
