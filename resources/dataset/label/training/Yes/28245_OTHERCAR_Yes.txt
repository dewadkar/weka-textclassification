            Ordered the Durango new in March '99, from factory.  This is a 4x4 with 5.9 engine, posi rear axle, heavy cooling & electric, optional tires, and upgraded interior.  At the time this vehicle was the only SUV with a functional 3rd seat (for kids) and huge power for a "mid-size" vehicle.  You can be assured that the vehicle will go up any hill in most any weather at any speed you want to travel.  On the open road the ride is smooth and quiet.  In the dirt, the ride can get very stiff and the speed needs to be kept down to prevent ultra jarring of the occupants.  On a nice day with the highway speed kept at 65 MPH or below the vehicle can get 20 MPG.  On a hot day with the air on and the speed at 75, the mileage is usually 16 MPG.  On a crowded freeway the mileage will be 13 MPG.  This is an excellent road vehicle, built tough and powerful.

Before we bought this vehicle, my wife and I test drove several SUV's consisting the Explorer, Trooper, Tahoe, and Cherokee.  At the time the Durango had exactly what we wanted, expecially the third seat.  The feel of the brakes, the feel of the steering wheel, the visibility, the power, and the fuel economy compared to the other vehicles above made Durango a winner.

During the years we have had the Durango the battery was replaced under warranty, the alarm was repaired several times, and the passenger door electric window regulator was replaced, and auto transmission speed sensor - all under warranty.  

Since '99, many new innovations have come out in SUV's along with better fuel economy.  We currently have 44,000 miles on the vehicle and plan to keep it a few more years.
