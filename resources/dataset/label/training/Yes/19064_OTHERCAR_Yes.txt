            I picked up this as my first digital camera.  I wanted a lot of features for a decent price and at a decent size.  There are a lot of things I like about this camera.  I love the amount of control I can have, from setting the exposure time (up to 16 seconds!!) to zoom.  The movies are OK, there's no sound, but if I wanted that, I would have bought a video camera. Nonetheless, its still a cool feature.  Something's I notice is that indoors, the pictures come out a little dark.  I almost always have the flash set to fire all the times.  The pictures sometimes come out a bit crooked.  I found a 2 degree clockwise twist in all my pics when taken straight.  I can correct this in PhotoShop, but it is a pain.  Perhaps this is just about my particular camera.

The battery life rules on this camera!!!

Other than those few dislikes, I love my camera.  If I were to update, I would stick with Olympus and possible get the E-10.  I highly rate this camera.<br><br>
