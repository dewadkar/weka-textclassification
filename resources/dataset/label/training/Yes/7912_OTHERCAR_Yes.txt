            I read all the reviews I could find before buying this camera, and finally splurged and spent the $350.  It sat for almost a month before I finally got time to open the box, thinking it would be difficult to get "up and running."  To my surprise, I took great pictures of my family from the very first one.  In fact, I like this camera so much that I gave my 35mm camera away!  The camera is easy to figure out, and the book answers any questions easily and completely. I am aware that this is a beginner camera, but I am not all that knowledgeable about white space and other camera settings--if I have any doubts about how a picture will turn out, I just take loads of shots--they are easy to edit and/or erase.  I set up some shots of a piano I wanted to sell, and credit the camera for the great pictures I was able to e-mail to the buyer. My only accessory purchases were a larger memory card, a camera case and a rechargeable battery pack.  I save my pictures on disc and print one or two of the best for the photo album.  I like the panorama setting, but I also like the fact that the camera doesn't overwhelm me with options I don't understand.  I like the way the camera looks, handles and the pictures it takes.  I think it is an outstanding value for the money--six months after buying it, I still see it showing up on top ten lists of digital cameras, competing with others that cost much more.  What is better, the price has come down 20% since I bought the camera last fall--I intend to purchase several more as gifts for my grown children.
