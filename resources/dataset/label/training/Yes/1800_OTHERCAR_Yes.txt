            I cant exactly remember what the year was of our cutlass supreme but I can tell you it was one heck of a dependable car.  Also at the time was one of the most stolen cars in our area.

My husband had bought this car off his cousin for $500 after the pontiac 6000 he had before was stolen and wrecked.  Being one of the most stolen cars in our area, we had it about a few weeks and it was attempted to be stolen but my husband being a mechanic knew how to stop that and did it ahead of time.  The window had been busted out and the steering wheel broken but they couldnt get anywhere with the car.  Too bad for them.  Needless to say we moved out of the city shortly after that.

Anyways back to the dependability.  During the Summer we had went to visit family and it was starting to rain.  They lived down along the Meremec River.  It was beginning to rain very hard and as we were pulling into the long driveway to their house, we were hit by a huge wall of water.  The car still running, we were able to pull thru the flash flood with a little help from a truck that had been right in front of us.  the brakes crystalized of course and once we were out of the water we slammed into the back of the truck.  Hours later after the rain stopped and the water receeded, we were able to start right back up and drive off.  Although the floors were soaked and the bottom of the seats were soaked, everything was just fine with the car.

This cutlass was a very dependable, smooth and comfortable ride.  If they are built now like they were built then, you people who own the newer ones must be having it great.  Just my opinion on the reliability of this vehicle.<br><br>
