            Not sure how to start this, but lets jump in.... I am a reformed gearhead. My 2 cars before the ZX5 were a Z28 and a BMW 633csi. The BMW was failing, so it was out to look for a new vehicle. The rules of engagement were.... Less than $18K, 30+ economy and fun to drive.

The candidates were, Nissan Sentra GXE, Pontiac Vibe GT, Mini and Focus.

The Nissan was good but had a power band sharper than a razor, not fun for a daily driver, the Vibe made so much noise at 4000rpm, I thought it must fall apart by redline at 6500, the Mini was a joke for the money, which left the Focus.

The Focus is deceptive, seems like more room inside than out, frugal - can't ever get the 35mpg, but always get more than 30 and is fun to drive.

It is consumately hilarious to watch people with way more expensive cars try to keep up through the twisties. The chassis is so well put together you have to verge on the brutal to make the wheels give up traction. There is no under or oversteer. Sure it could do with an extra 30 horses, but as it is it is a car you (or your granny) can drive quickly and be safely in its limits without worry.

The interior is spacious and comfortable, the MP3 CD player is a boon for those too lazy to change CD's - 100 songs make for a whole week.

My only gripe lies with the rear seat not being a split folding.

Other than that I love the car, I have had it three months now and I do not miss either of the other 2
