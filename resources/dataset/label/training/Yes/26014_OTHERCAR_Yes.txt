              I leased a '97 white Cavalier Z24 and had no problems ever and when the lease was up my dad bought it. We were going to get something different but kept coming back to the price and value of the Cavalier. We leased a silver 2000 Cavalier Z24 in June.  I like the improvements made to the stereo so you know what music station or CD track is on as well as the time instead of either/or. 
   I also like the lit up panel for drive, reverse, neutral etc because before it was awkward to check it on the dash. I like the keyless remote and I always tell people, once you go keyless, you never go back to using keys.
   We have a sunroof and also really enjoy it as well as the added light it provides. 
    The car is easy to drive around town and also does well on the highway. It is easy to park. This car would suit anyone and families.<br><br>
