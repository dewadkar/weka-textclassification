            I have been a 35 mm guy for over 30 years and have shot well over 15,000 images including a number of published photos and a magazine cover shot.  Not bad for an amateur.

After looking at every consumer level digital camera, I decided on the Nikon 995 in August 2001.  I shoot a combination of outdoor: landscapes and macro plus industrial photos for my work.  I was drawn to the 995 because it is small enough to pack in my computer case or a fanny pack and yet has a full compliment of attachment lenses - 2 fish eyes, a wide angle, 2 telephotos and a slide copier attachment.

The camera works in the Auto mode right out of the box and is a no brainer, even for someone who has never taken pictures.  Using the M or programmable mode takes some reading.  The manual is over 160 pages.  Even as an experienced amateur, after 6 months of use I am still reading the manual to learn everything that the camera can do in every mode.

I bought the wide angle lens, the 500 mm equivalent telephoto, the cable release and the slide copier attachment.  The wide angle is great.  The 500 mm, as you would expect from any lens of that length, absolutely requires a tripod.  The cable release is a pain to use.  For telephoto shots I usually use the timer in 3 second mode (push the shutter button twice).

The slide copier works great and is a real bargain.  I have transferred over 300 slides to digital for web publishing.  A whole lot cheaper than a slide scanner, and the quality is excellent.

After 2,000 pictures including an extensive industrial shoot for a PowerPoint presentation, about 2 hours of .MOV files (video without sound) and hundreds of outdoor images, I think I made the right choice.  If you are planning on replacing 35mm as I have, you need an extra battery, maybe two, and depending on your interest in quality pictures, filters - skylight, circular polarizer, neutral density.  I use 4 digital flash cards, 2 128k and 2 64k, enough for a 2-3 day backpacking trip.

The camera is tough.  I dropped it in New Orleans (no, I did not have too much to drink) on the concrete from about 4 feet, duh.  Broke the rotary selector switch, which I replaced myself for $28 (don't tell Nikon) and the camera is no worse for wear.  You should see the electronics inside of this thing.  Makes a computer look like a toy!

If you really want to learn to use this camera, find a copy of the Mastering Nikon Compact Digital Cameras - an eBook on CD.  I learned more in 20 minutes than in six months reading the manual. Good shooting.
