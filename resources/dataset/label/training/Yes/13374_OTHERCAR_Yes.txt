            I have owned several Cavaliers, several of them have been Z-24 models.  I began buying Cavaliers because they are economical, fun to drive, and usually inexpensive to purchase. I bought a Z-24 in July of 1999, it had only 59,000 miles on it when I purchased it.  Within 3 months, I had to replace the coil packs, and the ignition module.  The parts cost me just under $700.00 total to repair the car.  I did the work myself, as I do on most of my vehicles I own.  I feel that $700.00 is an extreme amount of money to put out for something that probably cost AC Delco less than $100.00 to manufacture.  Now, when I got into replacing these parts, I noticed that (and I measured) the coil packs and ignition modules are located 1.5 inches from the front exhaust manifold.  Now, this makes absolutely no sense to me at all, especially when these items are extremely prone to malfunction due to overheating.  Why would you put such an item so close to something that puts off over 800 degrees?  Especially knowing that when overheated, the item malfunctions...  I just cannot understand the logic behind it.  So, I called Chevrolet, and they told me that it was the most logical way to manufacture the automobile, and they had no answer as to why these items cost me so much to replace.  I just bought a 1993 Z-24, which had 45,000 miles on it when I got it.  I've since put 25,000 miles on it (in less than 3 months), and have had no problems with it.  This car has given me excellent service so far, it has a great amount of power with the 3.1 Liter V-6 engine, and a 5 speed manual (factory Muncie) transmission.  I run the 1/4 mile with the car, and it turns an impressive 13.80 time everytime I run.The only modifications I've put into it is a K&amp;N Filter Charger System, a dyna-jet fuel pump, a Zoom Racing Clutch, and different fuel injectors.  This car has impressed me beyond any limits I thought it might.  So, I would certainly recommend buying one, between the years of 1991 and 1994. The car handles very well in hard cornering, and on wet pavement, as well as on gravel roads, it has more acceleration than most Ford Mustang GT's, it is also a very comfortable car to drive on long trips, with excellent lumbar support, plenty of leg room for 4 passengers, and gets an average of about 28 miles per gallon on the highway.  If you have any questions, or opinions, or recommendations, please email me promptly... Thank You!<br><br>
