            I bought a Ford Escort when I graduated from high school (97).  That is the best car I have ever owned.  It is a maroon 4 door 1996 Ford Escort LX.  It was only a year old when I bought it.  So far, the only real problem I have had with it is the speedometer.  It bounces all over the place...but, that's just a minor problem, easily fixed.  It has never broken down on me or left me stranded.  The car is now 3 years old and I haven't had any real problems with it.  I bought this vehicle purely on  the rebound.  I went to buy a Dodge Neon, (used) and the salesman told me that he didn't really trust that particular Neon that they just brought in, but he had a better, and cheaper car that would be better.  He took me over to this little Escort, and I was like, &quot;oh, no, not an Escort.  That is too original&quot; It was cute enough, but I had my heart set on a Neon.  Anyway, I went ahead and unhappily hopped in the little maroon car, just to humor the salesman.  I took it for a test-drive and fell completely in love.  Everything was perfect in this car.  It drove smooth, purred like a kitten, and smelled great inside.  When I got back to the lot, the salesman told me details about the car.  I definatley liked what I heard.  
These cars are great on gas mileage and everything.  The car is small, but the compartment is very spacious.  I don't think I could be happier with any other car.  <br><br>
