            I bought my 2003 GTI 1.8T in January, 2003.  I have held off writing a review until I had some miles and time in it.  

First off, once you buy a GTI you become a member of a group of fanatics, who can talk about their GTI (whether it's the newest model or one from 10 years ago) for hours on end, and with that crazed smile on their face. It's just that kind of car.

VW posts a 0-60 time for the 1.8T of 7.5 seconds (7.7 for the VR6).  However, one drive in it and you'll know, this is no 7-plus car.  Fortunately, Car and Driver tested this engine and found a 6.5 time.  I would concur.  It's more quick than fast, but at the same time, it has amazing stability and feel at speed on the highway.  Put it this way, no rattles, drifts or vibrations when you're doing 90 .

A note on your engine choice.  I bought mine from a cousin who has been a VW/Audi/Porsche dealer for 15 years.  He said to get the 1.8 and I think he was right.  First, it's faster; second, better gas mileage; third, it's lighter; fourth, it handles better -- you have less weight pushing out the front tires in cornering.  You also don't sacrifice in engine noise or ability to move.  I test drove the VR6 and really didn't appreciate any difference in road feel.

Anyway, the interior on the car is great.  I got just about all the options:  Monsoon, leather/sunroof, ESP, 17 in. wheels.  The fit and finish is first-rate.  The dials and knobs don't feel cheap, nor do the seats or the dash.  The blue backlighting on the instruments gives the cockpit a cool glow at night.  The cupholder, as everyone mentions, is poorly positioned...right over the stereo and in the way of the CD slot.  My only other nag is the seatbelt - it's a pain to get unlocked when you want to put it on...takes a few tugs usually.  I would also recommend taking off the middle rear headrest.  You're rarely going to have three people in that backseat, and it clears up your view.

I know some people have complained about the reliability, but VW addressed the major window problem with steel brackets versus the old plastic.  I also don't have any rattles or hums cropping up as of this point.

The GTI handles wonderfully whether at high or low speed.  Second gear gives you tremendous turbo boost and provides the fun that first gear does not. A friend of mine who rode on the highway with me was amazed at how smooth it was and didn't feel like a small car (the engine didn't strain and translates the speed to the passenger more like a sedan). The stiff suspension may be a bit harsh for some (it's not very forgiving), but you'll be thankful for it on curving on-ramps, and zooming in cities.  For fun, take off the ESP and really give it a go.

The body style is still sexy, in my opinion, although it's probably due for change.  You can get the 20th Anniversary edition with a few more choices in body paint.  It also gives you 18in. wheels, red brake calipers and a custom interior with Recaro seats, among other things.  Other than the seats, I don't know if it's worth it, unless you just like to stand out. The "brushed aluminium" accents inside are getting played out in my opinion.  There's really no performance upgrade other than you now get the six-speed for the 1.8T.  Anyway, for "pocket rocket" sector, this will be a draw.

The service intervals are well-spaced, and you get the most out of the expensive premium fuel with excellent mileage per gallon.  I got 433 miles out of a full tank of 98% highway driving in one trip (I didn't go till it ran out, so take it for what it's worth).  That's about 30 mpg - which is hard to beat for the performance you get.
