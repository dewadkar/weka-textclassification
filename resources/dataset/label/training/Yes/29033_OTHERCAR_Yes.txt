            Lets see, where do I start for this one? Okay the CR V is a very comfortable ride. I only drove it a few times and I thought it was nice. Nothing to special about it but it is still fun to drive. The CR V is more of a lower ride to the ground than my old truck (a ford bronco 2). This is my only complaint about it. My old truck I felt like I was able to see more of the road ahead and allowed me to see if I would have to get out of the lane because of a slow down in traffic. The CR V is still higher than a car but it feels like you are driving a car. I personally like the feel of a truck better, but Honda has made it comfortable to drive. Something that I love about it is you can take turns faster if necessary. With most trucks you have to take turns slow because you may flip over, but because it is lower to the ground the chance of this happening is decreased greatly. The gas mileage is great (which means a lot these days because of the increase of gas prices over the past few years). When you go in gear it already wants to move, which means that you do not have to press to hard on the gas to get moving. I do have a complaint on the breaks though. They are a bit sensitive which i do not like. If you press on them lightly you slow down very quickly which I was not used to. It has a lot of room for passengers and cargo space. I am in a band and space is very important because we have to drag around a lot of equipment. It fits almost all of the drum equipment in the back of it which leaves room for amps in the back seat and maybe a person if you want. I liked the way it handled so I guess I would recommend this to you people too. <br><br>
