            I finally did it. I have sold my 4th truck and bought my first new car, a 2000 SL2.  I have owned the car for 3 weeks now and have driven over 3500 miles.  I took my sister and her two children (5 and 7) to their grandparents house in Oklahoma and their first family reunion in Colorado. 
The mileage is great and the A/C is even better. Having a Yakama bike rack and my Trek 1000 bike on the roof, four peoples worth of clothing, toys, front bike tire, and two tents in the trunk the car still averaged between 30 and 35 miles per gallon. 
The front seat alone has four (yes 4) cupholders available.  The back seat has another two centered where the adults in front can reach and control them. If you like to adjust your lumbar frequently, you will not like the big knob under the drivers seat. There is a small thing that pokes your fingers every time you grab too much of the knob.  The front windshield lets bugs and dirt around the seals making it hard top clean. 
If you are like me and need reminders on when to change your oil, you will like the oil reminder that Saturn has added this year.  By watching your speed, stops, number of starts, and oil viscosity you are told when to change your oil by the computer system.  So far I have not been told it is time even after 3500 miles.
The Saturn service team has been great so far. They had to install my cruis control after my purchase. The appointment was for 3:30 PM so I dropped the car off at 1:30 an my way to work. At 3:15 they had completed the job and my car was available. No grease stains from mechanics or messy paperwork to complete.  They do everything but sign for you saying the work was done.<br><br>
