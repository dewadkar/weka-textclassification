            I got this car because its fast!  180Hp in the GT-S model and you can't go wrong. You can get it in 6 different colors and interior in all black, black and silver, black and blue, black and red, and all leather, which i have.  The speed of this car is incredible.  It's faster than the Integra GS-R. The Double Over Head Cam engine is equipped with Toyota's VVTL-i, whish is Variable Valve Timing and Lift with Intelligence. This is almost exactly like the VTEC found in Hondas/Acuras.  The camshafts have larger loves for higher RPM's.  Overall, this car is perfect for speed lovers. If you're looking not to spend as much money you can go for the GT version with only 140HP.  It offers everything as the GT-S as options.<br><br>
