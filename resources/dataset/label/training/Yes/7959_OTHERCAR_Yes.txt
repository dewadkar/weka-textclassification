            First off - this is a Jeep Wrangler, not a Grand Cherokee. It rides somewhat rough (not anywhere near as rough as pre '95 models though), the soft top is loud, it is boxy, so gas mileage sux, it occassionally leaks (again, soft top), and it is not the best for high-speed passing. That said (a million times before), this vehicle is the most off road capable vehicle there is. If you want a vehicle to have a blast with on a warm summer day, take the top down and you're off! But, if you want a vehicle that is more plush, to ride to work in, and gets better gas mileage, you may want a different vehicle. It's a trade off. The coolest offroad/adventure vehicle vs. a more domesticated ride. It kills me to see reviews that slam this vehicle for its lack of foo-fooness. It is a utilitarian vehicle. Anyway, I replaced my factory soft top (now worn) with a Bestop Sailcloth Replace-a-Top and it is as virtually quiet as a soft top, no kidding. I have added tow hooks, step bars, tail-light guards, and all sorts of x-tras. I did replace the catalytic converter and timing chain as it had high miles when I bought it, so I shouldn't have to deal with that hopefully. Other than that, I do not add oil between oil changes, and it does not smoke or leak. I am impressed. It doesn't like to pass on the highway, but has great low end torque in the mud. From the reviews I have read, it seems like you either get a great Wrangler or a lemon. Fortunately, I got a good one. I do wish I had the 4.0L I6 to see if I liked it any better. Both get about the same gas mileage I hear (15-20 mpg) as the 4cyl has to work harder and the thing is a non-aerodynamic box. I would not recommend this as a first vehicle for a 16 year old, as the short wheel base makes sharp, sudden turns somewhat more dangerous - seasoned drivers should have no problem. DON'T DRIVE IT LIKE A PORCHE and you'll be OK!
