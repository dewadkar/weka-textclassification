            My husband and I after 3 years of driving a Ford Mustang decided to go out and find us a bigger car considering our family had expanded.  We were out looking and found what we feel was the best thing we could have found. We purchased a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am.  It is White with beautiful Gray cloth interior.  It came with all of the options...Power seats, door locks, power windows, cruise control and many more options.  It has been a real blessing for us.  It has lots of room in the back for the little ones to feel very comfortable.  The front is very comfortable as well with lots of leg room..  It gets really good gas mileage highway and city.  It has a very large trunk for those of us who have to travel with children and lots of luggage.  Not to mention it has a somewhat a sporty look.
I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is interested in purchasing a sporty, very efficient midsize car.  The price for these vehicles can vary considerably based on the options.  We paid $15,999 for ours and feel it is worth every penny of our hard earned money.
I personally have not found anything that I do not like about the car.  It does everything for me from locking my doors when it is put in gear unlocking when the key is taken out of the ignition, to keeping my lights on at all times.  Another thing that is very nice to about this car is the fact that once you have unlocked the doors while the ignition is on when you reach the speed of 5 miles per hour the doors will automatically lock for you once again.
The only negative opinion I have on the Pontiac Grand Am is it makes my driving experience a little to easy, it does everything for me so all I have to do is keep it between the lines.<br><br>
