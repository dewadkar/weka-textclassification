                   I just bought a 1999 Camaro SS with only 9000 miles on it. I have been driving it for almost a month now and it is an amazing car. It is almost addicting to drive. I feel like everytime I am in it I want to drive over 100mph. There are not many downsides to this car.
       
       It is pretty roomy for two people and the seats are nice. I wish that they would do something about the pedals though. I wear a size 12 shoe and I have wide feet and it is hard sometimes to get my foot down on the gas without hitting against the brake pedal. Besides that though you have to get one if you can. 
       
       I think the only other car I would drive is a Dodge Viper. The SS model comes with 320hp, enough to kill any stock mustang on the road including the Cobra. I beat a Cobra last week that was a stick and my car is an automatic by half a car length. It is so very fast. You feel like you are stuck to the seat when the pedal is on the floor. Besides the horsepower you also get some nice features. 
       
       I like the automatic headlights, electronic odometer, 500 watt monsoon soundsystem(very nice) and the spoiler is sweet. But my favorite thing about the car is the hood. It has a ram air scoop on the hood, it looks so mean. The exhaust system is also great. Sounds like a beast. No modifications needed, except maybe some flowmasters for the extra horses... If you have the money this car is a must have for the speed freaks. Your only other flaw with this car is gas mileage, but dont buy any sports car if you have a problem with that. Camaros Rule!!!<br><br>
