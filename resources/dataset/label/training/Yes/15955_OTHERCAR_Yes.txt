            The Epson PhotoPC 650 is worth the money.  This camera produces high quality photos every time!!! The photos transfer well to a disk, so the option of e-mailing them is wonderful. Highly recommended! The telephoto lens range is great for the price.  There is no red eye effect as with so many other cameras on the market today.  It is small enough to fit in a purse or fanny pack which is great for people who like to travel light.  It is very light weight.  The simplicity of operations make it easy to use, and that includes kids, and people who are just technology challenged.  For the price this camera is just plain hard to beat.  It has all of the features of the more expensive brand.<br><br>
