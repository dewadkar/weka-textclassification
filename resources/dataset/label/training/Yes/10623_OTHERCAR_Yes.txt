            We studied all cars on the net for about 3 months and this car is by far the best car for the money.  It has features that you usually find on cars costing 30k, but on the CDX they are standard. For instance; sunroof, 6-disk cd player, leather, wood trim, spoiler, and projectors.

 We bought a demo car with 5k on it and got it for $3500 under the sticker. We even got 4.9 % APR for 36 months on the demo car.  Very friendly and competent sales staff and service plans.  They offer a free maintenance package for 3 year/36k miles that is worth around $1000.
This includes all maintenance for that time period including oil, filter, wiper fluid, blades, and scheduled maintenance in the warranty book.
The car should be pretty easy to maintain and work on since it uses GM engine, transmission, and electronics from the General Motors Holden plant in Australia.  

Rumor has it that the 2.2 Inline 4 cyl (131 bhp) D-tec engine in the Leganza is next years Cavalier engine that Holden is &quot;testing&quot; in the partnered Daewoo Leganza. The engine is definitely adequate for the car and provides plenty of power for passing. But I expect that the typical  power hungry American would like to see a V6 offered.  For your information, the 2001 Leganza CDX will come with the option of a 3.3 V6.
 
 I usually like a more aggressive handling car, but this car rides and says luxury.  The interior of leather and wood along with the cockpit give the car an expensive European feel.  That is something that most of its competitors will never be.  The tires are hard and have long tread life but the car would handle better with softer American performance  rubber.(Goodyear GSC's, for instance?)

The car comes with a nice warranty package, but we still are not sure how the long term reliability of Daewoo's Leganza will be. We got the bumper to bumper 5 yr/75k warranty just in case for $500 and that can't be touched by any domestic car.

It takes a few minutes to get used to the &quot;Korean&quot; interior controls and markings , but they work well and are nicely placed in reach.  No major complaints yet, but I wish they would have put the cruise control on the steering wheel. They also need to add auxiliary power outlets for radars/phones/laptops. This will be an issue with the American shoppers since the owners manual tells you not to use the  lighter for accessories. (??!!) Looks, comfort, price, and options! Just test drive this car and you will buy !! :)<br><br>
