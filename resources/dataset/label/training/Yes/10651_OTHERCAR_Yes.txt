               We bought the Van in September 1997, and had considered buying the '97 model but were intrigued by the '98 that offered 4 doors, and captain seats for the middle row.  The van that we purchased was everything I wanted ... well almost everything.  It has 4 doors, captain seats in the middle row, a CD & Tape player (usually this costs extra), MANY cup holders, AC & Heat vents in the back & front, some neat hooks on the back seat to prevent groceries from scattering all over, luggage rack on top, and an attractive interior fabric.  
    The idea of getting the Grand model was tossed around, we had considered getting the shorter version because of the more flexible parking abilities, but we found the perfect van (which is described above) and it was a Grand ... The major disadvantage of the Grand Voyager is that because of the extra 16" that makes it longer it makes it rather difficult sometimes to park, and instead of just pulling into a parking slot, we have to back up and make several attempts before we can turn the car off. 
    Never have had any major mechanical problems with it, there have been a few problems, but you can't have a car that doesn't have any problems in 4 1/2 years of owning it can you?  
    The mileage isn't the greatest, usually on a road-trip it's about 23 at the maximum, and usually averages about 20 mpg city/highway. 
   A MAJOR advantage though of this mini van is that because of the extra 16" length there's plenty of leg room for tall people, and 6ft long plywood can easily fit when all of the seats are removed.  When the seats do need to be removed they have wheels, that make it easier.  The captain seats are light weight and 1 person can remove them.  They allow the possibility of just a little bit of extra room, but keeping the capacity of 6 people if just one seat is removed.
    All in All it's definitely worth it if you need the room, and don't want to spend an additional 6k for the fancier Town & Country, when you can get everything, but the leather seats in a cheaper model of the exactly same van!
