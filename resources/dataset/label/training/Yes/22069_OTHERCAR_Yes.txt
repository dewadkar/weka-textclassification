            I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea with this epinion - I really, really like my Kodak DC215. (It's the silver one.) But I don't know if I can get into detail about all the great things it does... I mean, it's just a digital camera. Takes pictures, yes. Two times zoom, yes. 640x480 and 1158x864 resolutions, yes. Lets you review pictures on an LCD screen, yes. Nothing to develop, yes. Looks cool, yes. All the bases are covered there.

So I'm going to talk about a few little things I'd change, and if you fancy yourself some sort of digital camera connoisseur or something, you can pick through what I've said and say to yourself "well, I don't want <i>that</i>".

My main gripe is that the camera comes with only a serial cable to connect to your computer. USB is so much faster, and is pretty much standard these days, so I'm not sure why Kodak is using the old, old serial technology. In any case, if I fill the four meg card the camera comes with, it takes about fifteen minutes to download all of those pictures. Too slow.

The camera itself is kind of heavy. If you're used to carrying around junky disposables, you'll definitely notice the weight in your pocket, but I imagine that people who use "real" cameras won't notice much of a difference.

A set of four AA batteries are required, and the set that Kodak provides are pretty terrible. I killed them off after only two photo shoots, but don't get the wrong idea - the DC215 isn't that much of a battery hog. Pick up a sturdy set of rechargeables and you'll get ten or twelve shoots out of them, maybe more. (Be stingy with the LCD use. That's the real battery killer.)

In any case, I really, really enjoy my camera. It's not for everyone - the image quality is not as sharp as some others can provide, but then again, the Kodak DC215 isn't anywhere near as expensive as the high-end cameras. (It retails for around $400 here in Canada.) It's fun for the casual photo taker, fine for close-ups and in most lighting conditions, and great for the web. 

If you'd like to check out some examples of pictures I've taken with the DC215, visit http://www.danwalker.ca/pictures/ - the "collections" area is entirely images that were captured with my digital camera. They're just the usual family/event/outdoor pictures, but if you're a casual user like I am, that's all you're doing anyway. In these conditions, I'm sure you'll like the DC215.
