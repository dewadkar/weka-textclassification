            Just got this today at Office Max for $149.99 with a free 32mb memory card and Dazzle memory card reader. Definitely a fantastic deal, but just the camera along is awesome. It takes great pictures, with beautiful quality and resolution. It will do a 60 second video with audio. The quality is poor on the video, but after all this is a camera and not a camcorder. It has a different functions to keep you busy, but once you get them down it's a breeze. Many people who aren't comfortable with gizmos and technology, might find it a little daunting. It isn't a point and shoot camera, you have to fine tune it a little, but the results are worth it. If this is your first DC then you will be happy and would even make a great travel camera. The only two issues I have with it are, it eats batteries (get 1800Mah NiMH rechargables for it) and the time between shots, otherwise it is a great camera!
