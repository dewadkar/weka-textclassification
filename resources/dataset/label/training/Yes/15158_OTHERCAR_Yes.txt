            Got the Toshiba PDR-M60 for Christmas and was able to put it to use within a few minutes.

But it eats batteries like there is no tomorrow. The four Toshiba alkaline batteries that came with the camera lasted for just four shots.

The manual pretty much stinks. It is poorly written and gives little detailed information.

In trying to get an AC adapter, I was directed to ShopToshiba. The price for a 5 volt AC adapter was $49, plus shipping!

I then tried to call customer service to ask whether a Radio Shack 4.5 volt AC adapter would work. At $12, it was considerably less expensive. But I never got my answer. I spent more than 45 minutes on hold on Toshiba's so-called technical support line and never got the chance to ask.

Bottom line: nice camera, but bad Toshiba service and very expensive add-ons.  <br><br>
