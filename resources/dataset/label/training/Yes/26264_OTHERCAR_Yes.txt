            I was searching for a reliable, fuel efficient, environmentally friendly and reasonably priced car after graduating from college.  I wanted something that wouldn't cost me a fortune to maintain but would last for the long-term. I also wanted a car that didn't depreciate at a ridiculous rate and would still be worth something 5-10 years from now with 150,000 miles on it.  I ended up buying the 2000 Honda Civic EX.  It's a GREAT VALUE!

There are several things I LOVE about the Civic EX:
 - Gas Mileage 43 miles/gallon on highway, 30-35 City
 - Moon Roof
 - CD Player
 - Reliability
 - Maintenance costs (minimal)
 - Pick-up relative to comparable cars on the market
 - Low rate of depreciation
 - Quiet ride

The Honda Civic is definitely one of the most fuel efficient cars on the market and is worth every penny, especially these days with our astronomical fuel prices.  

The Civic is also ideal for people who live in the city as it fits into just about any parking space.
 
I would add several points of caution when buying the Civic EX:
 - No lumbar supports make long road trips slightly uncomfortable
 - The pickup is slow at times, even though the EX has more 
   horsepower     
   than the DX and LX.  However, it is still decent relative to other  
   cars in its class.
 - If you're planning on adding a bike rack, it's very expensive to get a 
   rack that fits such a small roof.
