            Last Summer, my husband decides that it's time we had a bigger vehicle.  As a family of 6, we were in desperate need of it,so we bought a 1998 Plymouth Grand Voyager. I love it, the kids definitely love. It drives like a dream,and everybody has plenty of room to stretch out. It gets good gas mileage, considering the fact that I have a 45 minute commute to work everyday and only spend $20 a week.  I call that great. It has 2 built-in car seats,tinted windows,cruise control,several hooks for your groceries, am/fm stereo and cassette player,cup holders galore,air conditioner for everyone, pretty decent sound system,and sliding doors on both sides. That is the feature I love most about the Voyager, with four kids, I needed the extra door. It seats about 7 people comfortably, but we have had up to eight people. I took her on a really long trip to NY and she performed well. We have had our Voyager for 6 months now and we have not had even one problem. Oh yeah, we always buy used vehicles and have never had any problems. So don't be afraid to buy a used vehicle. <br><br>
