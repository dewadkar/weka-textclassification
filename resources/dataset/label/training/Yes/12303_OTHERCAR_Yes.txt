            I purchased my 2000 Eclipse GS in January 2000. So far I have driven it 5000 miles and have not yet had a single mechanical problem. The 4 cylinder, which I purchased in a five speed, is sufficiently fast for general commuting. However, if you like to race, or show off to your friends, you will definitely want to go with the noticeably faster V-6.

The physical appearance of the car is probably its greatest selling feature. There have been at least a dozen instances in which I have come out of a restaurant, or store and seen someone walking around my car and looking in the windows. countless other times I have received compliments about the way it looks.

My only real complaint is with a negative outcome of the physical styling. There is no body molding. Though it looks great, the drawback is that you have no protection against door dings, of which I already have two.<br><br>
