            ...this year!  I bought my 2000 Grand Am GT in December of 1999.  I had just returned from a five year tour in Japan and had become very familiar and used to the Japanese cars.  When I returned to the US I found that the models, comfort and fit and finish I had come to enjoy did not exist in export models.  I tested the major imports and found them to be very reasonable base priced but expensive when you added the options.  So I decided to look at the American cars.  To say the least I was pleasantly surprised!

I went to my local Pontiac dealer and found the sales staff to be very responsive to my desires.  The salesman showed me the Grand Am on the showroom floor inside and out.  He was very knowledgeable on equipment and options.  Then he took me to the lot to show me the cars in stock.  I picked a dark metallic green GT about three rows deep in stock and he actually got the one I bought out for a test drive.

On the test drive we encountered all your standard stop and go driving conditions.  It had a tight suspension and gave very good visibility in the front and nominal visibility over the high back deck.  The four wheel anti lock disc brakes took a little getting used to, but otherwise provided tremendous stopping power.  I was afforded the opportunity to evaluate the car's handling on a winding road, very impressive.  The car was tight and responsive.  Here was where the sport suspension and variable assist steering showed off.  I had no problem keeping it between the lines even at speeds exceeding the posted limit for the curves.  Next we hit the expressway.  We rocketed into traffic.  The car accelerated smoothly through it's four gears and settled nicely into overdrive.  It had a powerful response and sporty sound (deep throaty growl form the dual exhaust)not normally found in six cylinder cars of this size and price range.  The salesman informed me that the car would do all of the speedometer indicated 150MPH, although I'm not sure why... my insurance company did ask me if I intended to race the vehicle!!!

A word of caution... this car handles beautifully at high speeds.  The feel does not adequately relate to actual miles per hour.  I find myself driving faster than I anticipate and have to watch my speed more often than other cars in this class.

Fabulous options packages.  Roomy interior, large trunk.  The stereo system shakes the rear view mirror!  Nice layout of the analog gauge package, leather wrapped steering wheel and gear shifter.  Powerful 175HP Ram air V6 with platinum tipped plugs means no tune ups for 100K miles.  The automatic four speed with OD transmission is a sealed unit and does not require service for 100K miles.  Tires are speed rated for 60k miles... this vehicle is designed for low maintenance gas and oil only minded people.
 
After a year in the vehicle I have to say I am still impressed and excited with this car.  Fit and finish, comfort, power, options and most importantly price all make this car an exceptional value.  It is understandable why it is one of Pontiac's best sellers. <br><br>
