            i had just bought a new 98 integra ls hatchback about a year ago,so far the car is pretty cool,the only reason it went into the garage for non maitenence reasons,is because the drivers side door striker wasnt set right and the door didnt close properly.other than that i have had no problems.   when i had first bought the car it was too quiet for me so i had to buy some aftermarket accessories. so i bought exhaust,header,intake,ect,and i have been driving the car pretty hard since i bought it.  Now it has 32,000 miles on it and i still have no problems. i will let u know that the top speed of an acura integra ls is 137mph, and at that speed it was like driving at 50 mph, it wasnt bumpy or shaking, it was just as smooth as 50mph.     A couple of things i didnt like about the car was that the back seats are tiny, they are obviously made for a little kid,and when you are driving in the rain you cant put your window down a little bit cause the rain off the front window comes in. i bought this vehicle because i wanted somthing that was goin to be reliable and good on gas, and since acura has a good line of products i choose the integra because it was in my price range. this is a peppy little 1.8 16v dohc motor, a lot of my friends were suprised at how fast it is, i plan on buying a turbo kit for it in the near future, that will put it to the test.i think this is a good car for a single person or someone has small children or no children<br><br>
