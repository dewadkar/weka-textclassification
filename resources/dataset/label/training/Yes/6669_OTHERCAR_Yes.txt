            I purchased a 2000 4 door tracker 4 months ago. I did not want to spend alot of money and test drove two other small suv. My wife and I spent a month trying to decide which suv to purchase when she surprised me one day by having it parked in our driveway when I came home from work.  We have since drove it to the smoky mountains and enjoyed the trip in the vehicle. It handles well except for being light and having those big semi's move you a little when they go by you or are in front of you. The 4 cylinder engine conserves gas fairly well but could use a little extra power.  The only thing I wish is that the 6 cylinder now available would had been available when we purchases ours.  Overall we really like the tracker and would recommend it to others and I would give it 4 stars.     <br><br>
