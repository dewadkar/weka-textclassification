            I'm so excited, after two Buick LeSabre's I can't get enough of this very classy car.  I can't believe we had the old one as long as we did.  It was a 92 and now I am into the 2000.  But this time we got the touring package.  I like this car so much because it feels like you are riding in something very solid and safe.

If you don't like feeling like you are in a tin can, this is the car for you.  I'm not crazy about riding around with my lights on all day but the other features are wonderful.

I did not get my first choice on color so I was able to get a few goodies thrown in.  I am going to tell you about them.  Like the sensory on the windshield that makes the wipers just come on to the speed of the rain.  What I mean is that if it is raining hard the wipers will go faster with out me trying to adjust them.

I like the comas on the rearview mirror as well as the way I don't have to get the glare of the headlights from the person behind me.  I know I could get the manual and really explain but I think I should just tell you enough to make you want to go and see this car.

How about the lumbar support in the seats and now both driver and passenger front seats adjust to your personal desires.  I love the features on the steering wheel, like the source button that lets you float between radio and CD player as well as cassette.

I could go on and on, but then I would be writing a book, like so many others and when you want to read more opinions I don't think you want to take twenty minutes just on mine.  But don't be surprised when I find another way to tell you more about this wonderful car.  There is the trunk release button that I have never had to give up on.  And have you ever just used your remote to find your car in that big parking lot, it's like the car talks back to you.<br><br>
