            I bought a 1996 Chrysler Cirrus In December 1995, the first time I ever bought a really new car at the beginning of the model year. I fell in love with it as I passed it on the lot, and to this day, I still love my car! This is my fourth car, and I have had practically every possible mechanical problem known to mechanics on other cars. My Cirrus, on the other hand, runs very well! Smooth ride, great anti-lock brakes--which have saved me from half a dozen fender benders--comfortable interior, it all has been an amazing experience. The style caught my eye, and the tilt steering wheel really made me interested, as I am a large woman. The test drive was so great, I took it out twice. Even the salesman was nice, as opposed to my experience of less-than-nice car salespeople. The dealership is also great, bringing  my car in for service is a pleasant experience--what a concept--and sometimes costs less than the estimate. I had had a few recalls, and the engine light go on, all of which were slightly inconvenient, but not a problem. I got the very extended warranty, which includes assistance for lock-out, out of gas, dead battery, etc. I had to use it once for driver caused dead battery, and in less than an hour, I was on my way again, faster than AAA. As you can tell, I am truly pleased with my car, and tell everyone who comments about her to me. It has been very handy for making conversation with guys, who have been uniformly impressed. Try a Cirrus, they are the greatest!<br><br>
