            I went shopping for a vehicle five days ago, and I actually thought that an SUV was a little over my head when it came to price.  I had always admired the Grand Cherokee,  but I had never considered purchasing one.  I made the trip to the Chrysler-Jeep dealership to check out the Jeep Liberty since it seemed to fall into my price range.  I was very disappointed with the size of the Liberty and felt very cramped up on my test drive.  The dealer told me that I would fall in love with a Grand Cherokee if I would try one out.  I told him that probably wasn't a good idea if they cost as much as I had feared.  He talked me into giving it a try, so I went for it.  He was right!  I instantly became attached to the Grand Cherokee and began to hope that I could afford one.  It turned out that the price was a lot lower than I expected, and there was also a $3000 rebate at that time.  Thanks to all that, I was able to buy a white 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee without any money down at all.  It came with cloth seats, but I take it back next week for them to install leather.  It was part of the original deal, and I'm looking forward to it.   
<p>I was very impressed by all of the options in the vehicle.  It has been a while since I purchased a new vehicle, but it really felt like there were more options that were standard with this deal.  Power windows, doors, and driver's seat is a great benefit.  I was also pleased with all of the room in the back.  The rear seats will lay flat to make this space even larger.  I doubt that I will have many opportunities to use this, but it's nice to know that it's there if needed.  
<p> I would highly recommend the convenience groups as an optional package.  It includes the mini-overhead console, vehicle information center, traveler/mini trip computer, keyless entry-remote, better tires, floor mats, cargo compartment cover, and a power sunroof.  I could do without many of these, but they are very, very nice to have.
<p> The second day that I had my new vehicle, I had to take it on a 300 mile trip (600 miles total).  It was a great chance to see how the Grand Cherokee would perform on a long drive.  I couldn't have been happier with the comfort and room.  The mini computer was fun on this long drive.  I was able to see how far I'd driven and how long it was taking me.  Paying attention to these things were a great way to pass the time.  The gas mileage wasn't wonderful, but we were driving in very strong winds.  The maximum that I reached on the trip was an average of 19.3 mpg, and I was really hoping to see it hit the low 20s.  It gets even worse driving around in the city.  The only thing I'd change on the vehicle is the gas efficiency.  It could get expensive after a while.  Thanks to the mini computer letting me know how many miles until empty, I didn't have to worry about running out of gas.
