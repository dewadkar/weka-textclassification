            First off, let me just say I love my car.  It is fast, it is safe, it gets decent gas mileage.  What's not to love.

As a recent college grad I decided I needed (well wanted) a new car.  I decided that my 1993 Plymouth Colt may not be the best car to be commuting 100 miles a day in, I wasn't exactly sure it could handle the drive way.  So, I decided to suck it up and spend some of my hard, as of yet unearned money.

Being the smart business man I am, I did all sorts of research.  I read online profiles, magazines, talked to people, and decided that &quot;My first new car is going to be a Honda Civc!!!&quot;  Now, I know what you're thinking, um, dude, this is totally supposed to be about the Alero.  Well, it is.  If you'd give me time I'd get to that.

So, as I was saying, I was going to buy a Civic.  I went to a local dealer and decided to test drive one of those babies.  Sweeeeeet.  So, I pull into the dealership, and all sorts of fun role my may.  I realized that, wow the Civic is really pretty small.  Hmmm.  Well, that's ok I guess.  So, after 20 minutes someone decides to help me.  Yeeha!!!  I hear all about the Civic, it's reliable, it's fun to drive, blah blah blah.  Long story short, test drove it and hated it.  Now to the Alero.

I'm driving home in my beast of a car (the Colt), and pass an Olds dealer.  I'm thinking why would I buy an Oldsmobile?  My grandpa drives an Olds.  Then I see this green car sitting there, and I think, oh my God, it's my car.  So, i go home do the research, and it's comporable to all the other cars I've been looking at, but it has bonuses. 

So I buy my Alero, which I love.  It has 15&quot; Alloy Wheels, cruise, 6 speaker CD/Cassette (gets awesome bass), 3.2l V6 (flys on the highway), spoiler, and a totally unique color (only seen one other car like it).  Dealership through in some perks and I was good to go.

Horror Story!!!!!!!
2 months after buying it, I got side swiped.  My baby was nearly totaled.  The police officer pulled up on the scene and was expecting the worst.  The four of us in my car walked away!!!!!  We didn't even realize where we had been hit.  The impact ripped the front bumper square off the car and we had no idea.  How's that for safety?  So, we live to drive another day.  I got my Alero all fixed up and works as good as new.  

I would recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
