            I have had my '99 Mercedes E430 for nine months now and I still smile every time I take the driver's seat. Mine is a rare midnight blue with tan leather interior.
The combination of quiet understated luxury along with enormous V-8 muscle car power is truly extraordinary. The only car that I have been in that comes close is the BMW 540 but the Mercedes is simply a higher quality vehicle. My test drive of the 540 showed nice driving manners but I was disappointed by the lower fit-and-finish and the pimp-like doo-dads all about the cabin. The Mercedes is more refined. Also, I felt more room when I sat in the back seat. Why have a four-door sedan if the back seat doesn't pamper the passengers?
After a week of driving aggressively, I noticed that the traction control light would flicker whenever I would accelerate rapidly. My guess was that the stock M&amp;S-rated Continentals were not up to the task. I contacted Tire Rack and ordered a set of Carlsson 19-inch rims and Pirelli P-Zero tires -- with P275/30ZR19's in back. What a difference! Now the benz has the grip to match the power! The Carlssons look almost like the stock rims and are a good match for the understated Mercedes. I could barely tell the difference in the ride.
I bought this car to be a second car for weekends and whenever I could not fit people or things in my daily-driver Miata. However, I am having a hard time keeping the miles off!
