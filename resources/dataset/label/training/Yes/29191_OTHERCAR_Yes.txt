            The pros and cons about the 99 dodge neon. When I first brought my 99 dodge neon, I was in awe of it picking up my car at night, with a new car look to it. The one I picked up of the sports coup, with the double head cam engine 150 horsepower engine, sunroof, and everything power. The pros of the car it's the sleak design, the speed the car, this car can get up and go when it needs to. (Wonder of it would do if I chose a stick) A gas saver, and good interior design. Another thing on the car is the sound system, the system in my car can hit, and it only has stock speakers. 
Now to the cons, Sometimes the car makes noise early in the morning, like a humming sound in the engine. The windows sometimes sqeak when rolling it
up. But overall the car is a great car, I rather have the old design rather the new design. Everything in my car is stock, wait until I change everything it it.
