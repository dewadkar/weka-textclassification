            I bought this camera at a local camera shop because all of the internet stores were sold out (that was a good sign of a good product - I thought).  I was right.  I love this camera!  decided to go with this camera over the S230 because of the megapixel size and that it used AA batteries, not a rechargable battery within the camera.  I like the idea of being able to buy batteries if I out & about.  I know other people that like the battery in the S230, personal preference.  The A70 only came with an 8MB card which is very small, but the price of flashcards has dropped so much that I found a 128MB that handled my D.C. trip just fine.  This is a little bigger than the S230, but has better specs as a compromise.  I like being able to take small quicktime videos (but it is not a camcorder, so it has limitations).  I was very pleased with this camera's ability to take low light picts (with a tripod).  The main reason I got this camera is the panoramic stitch within the camera, not just in the software.  I think the color reproduction is great.  I rarely have to adjust the files in photoshop and then it is just a tweak.  The are only 2 problems I have: 1)the red eye reduction doesn't work very well and 2) I frequently have problems getting the software to connect to the camera.  Not a big enough problem to detract from the overall of this great camera.
