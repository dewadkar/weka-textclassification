            In searching and researching to buy my first NEW vehicle, many factors came to mind. Price, safety, reliability. It so happens I live in a rural area, but there are many, many car dealerships to visit. I tested a few cars, but the Kia Sportage (it's an SUV) really caught my eye (and wallet!)

First off, the Sportage is so cute!! This is definitely a woman's SUV (sorry guys...no discrimination intended!) It handles like a charm, comes in standard and automatic (I bought the automatic!)The Sportage has a wheel base that I feel comfortable with. Although, like all SUVs, the center of gravity is higher than cars, the danger of tipping over is there...ONLY if you don't drive carefully!! 

There is enough room to seat 5 comfortably, and about 10 cubic feet of storage room behind the back seats. The dealer explained the crumple zones to me, and also told me that in the unfortunate event of a head-on accident, the engine is built on a track that forces it to the ground...not into the front seat of your vehicle. 

The Sportage comes in some great colors, a regular and &quot;EX&quot; model (I got the EX...okay, okay...I spoiled myself!). I got my 1999 Sportage in August of 1999, fully loaded (CD, air, power everything) and paid just a touch over $18,000!! The nearest vehicle in comparison with the Sportage would have cost me $24,000! 

It comes with a 3 year/36,0000 mile warranty (5 year power train!). And...Kia has a 24-hour help line to help with anything from a flat tire to a tow. All in all...I feel this was one of the best buys I ever made. I did have a small problem with the paint on the cladding (it started flaking off at the car wash), but the dealer replaced everything. Free. I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone! Even you guys!!! :-)<br><br>
