            I have owned my Lumina for 16 months and I have not had a single major problem with it. The crank sensor went out and the upper heater hose blew, but beside that, no complaints what so ever. I have replaced the front brakes (rotors, pads & shims) which cost me less than $30 for parts and I easily did the labor myself. It has 164,000 miles on it and runs as well as most newer cars. Nice ride too. I had to drive nearly 400 miles between 3 states during mid summer with the A/C on the entire time and didn't even notice a strain. Just nice cold air and pure comfort. Also, the 3.1 V-6 gets excellent gas mileage. I highly recommend this car!
