            I have driven a '93 Plymouth Sundance for about three years and have been more than satisfied with its performance. True, it doesn't have the power of a larger, more expensive vehicle. But for its price range it is a treasure.

Repairs have been almost unnecessary - surprising, considering that it has over 95,000 miles on it. Keep the oil changed and do the usual maintenance, and even a mechanical-dunce like me will get along fine.

The Sundance is a smaller car and can fit into parking spaces for compact cars. This is a definite advantage in situations where parking is limited.

As for comfort, there are some limitations. Tall persons might have difficulty. And the seats could be shaped better.

The one real complaint in my situation is that the driver's seat belt does not retract and is often caught in the door as it is shut. This is a minor frustration, however.

Overall, a great little car!<br><br>
