            Here I am in a candy apple red Alfa Romeo 166 in Italy.  After 15 days on the road in Italy,  I now know from my driving experience why Alfa Romeo owners are so passionate about their cars. I  could live with this car for a very long time.

Exterior:	9
Wonderfully modern yet with subtle lines and curves - Italian!  Great alloy wheels.  To my eyes, the grill is the most identifiable but least attractive part of the body.  This is definitely a luxury sports sedan.

Interior:	7
This is a near luxury car. This rental car had a charcoal cloth interior and so it did not enhance the otherwise modern and very useful dash controls. The driving position was excellent and all controls were within easy reach.  There was a computer and navigation display. Front seats could be adjusted in all directions and tilt.  All power equipment. Climate control handled the hot August weather with ease. Higher class models would have luxury interiors.

Engine:	9
This rental car had the 136 HP turbo diesel engine which was very flexible and responsive. Power was more than adequate although not tire burning. This is the economy model. Top speed of over 200 km/h with an acceleration of 9.5 s to 100 km/h.  This car was for the long distance cruiser but can handle acceleration lanes and fast country road driving with ease.  I'd like to have driven the 3.0 litre gasoline model.

Handling:	9+
Superb!  It responded directly to the most subtle inputs in steering, braking and power input.  I can't get over it's smooth and direct responsiveness to steering inputs - perhaps the tires contributed a lot with that 'feel'.  Moreover, a small input on the accelerator would immediately result in very noticeable acceleration. 

Ride:		9+
Wonderful!  It rode smoothly and quietly and is unperturbed by irregular road surfaces or bumps. The car rode very flat and did not lean in corners or perturbed in any way in bumpy or on curvy roads. At 100 mph, you'd think you were travelling at 50 mph in a serenely quiet interior.   I cruised for over 3 hours at that speed and it was like a Sunday drive - no stress of any kind on the steering or responsiveness of the car.

Reliability: ?
No data.

Cost:	?
I'm assuming it will undercut its competition easily with more equipment for much less money.

Value:	10
My understanding is this car is about at a 23% discount in comparison to Audi's, BMW's, Mercedes',...

Verdict:	
Excellent

As a result of living and driving in Europe for 2 years, I presently own both a BMW 5 series (E34) and a Mercedes E300 - largely for their high speed handling, reponsiveness and suspension but especially for their road feel and feedback.  I have been very happy with both vehicles.  My next purchases were to be from the same source: Audi, BMW or Mercedes - until I drove this Alfa, a car I never gave any previous consideration to.  For my style of driving, this car is more than I could hope for: there was a great sense of balance, very responsive steering and handling, great creature comforts, good size and more than adequate power. The car did not feel 'heavy' with a lot of inertia and just sheer power to make things happen.  There was a lightness to it all.  Suffice to say,  I'm very enamored with it and only wish this car was available in North America where I would give very serious consideration for my purchase.

Rating:	9+
