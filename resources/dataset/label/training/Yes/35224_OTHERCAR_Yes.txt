            It doesn't take much to fall in love with a 4Runner - it looks good, it smells good, and it DEMANDS respect on the road. For $35K with all the trimmings, it's a great buy relative to Land Rovers and the such. However as with most new cars, there's a lot of things you learn when you've owned it for a few weeks. Here's what we found out:

Stiff ride - although the inside feels like a luxury auto, the ride is stiff. Our friends pack in the back expecting a Cadillac-esque ride, but end up looking for lids for their lattes. There's no &quot;ride&quot; adjustment - it's basically set on &quot;sport&quot; permanently (I guarantee you'll hear your friends ask at least once a month &quot;are the shocks set on 'sport'?&quot;). So if you want the smooth ride, get something else.

V6 won't tow jack - you'd think that big car would be able to tow a big boat, but it won't. If you need towing, go for the Land Cruiser.

Other than these, we love the car. Definitely go for the Limited if you have a choice, and don't let them convince you that high demand = high price. AutoByTel will set you up.<br><br>
