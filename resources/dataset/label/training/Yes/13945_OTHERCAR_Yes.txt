     I own a 1998 Subaru Outback that I bought new.  I feel it is the safest car I have ever driven with its seatbelt/airbag systems and ABS brakes.  I also enjoy the all wheel drive.  The car I have has a cold weather package which I have come to love on the cold mornings when driving to work.  This system includes heated seats, wipers, and mirrors.  I am not very tall and this car allows me the ability to see clearly while driving.  It also serves as a family car having 5 seats and a large area in the rear for stuff.<br><br>
