            We bought our Taurus about a year ago because we were ready to upgrade to a better suited family car. Initially my wife was the one turned on to this car mostly because of it's looks. One of the main reasons that I decided to purchase this car was the ride and the room that it has. 

One of my main criteria for buying a car is leg room in the back. I have been in to many cars that had no room in the back seat and it can be terrible if you have to go any distance. I am not the tallest person but I have a relaxed driving style and I like the drivers seat to be back a little further than normal. So I got in the car set the seat where I was comfortable and then got in the back seat. I was amazed at the room that was there. I could even stretch my legs out most of the way while sitting behind the drivers seat.

 Also I like the way the car handled. It has a very smooth ride and didn't have much of the road noise like some other comparable cars in its class. Ours is a GL model and I really like the center console that lifts up out of the seat. The dashboard is very well laid out with everything easy to see and the controls for heat/AC and the radio are also easy to reach. Having the cruise controls on the steering wheel are also a plus.

 All in all this is a very well made car and fun to drive. I would recommend this car to any small family who isn't big enough for a van but can't get by with a two door car either. If you are looking for a sporty, quick car don't look here. While the sleek shape looks nice it is no sports car and it will let you know if you try to get on the gas too much. <br><br>
