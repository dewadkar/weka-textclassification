            I've owned by Subaru Impreza for a little over one year now and have had absolutely no problems with it whatsoever.  The model year is 1996 with about 60000 miles currently on it.
Overall, I enjoy everything about the car.  The handling and acceleration are great.  The ABS brakes react very well when needed.  Both the driver and passenger side seats provide a lot of room.  The rear seats are a little crampted which could get uncomfortable to passengers on long trips.  After three years the exterior of the car is still in great condition.  There is no rust and the the molding is still perfectly attached to the car.  
Because I live in New England, the all wheel drive is a major advantage to owning a Subaru.  With snow a regular event, it is nice not to worry about getting stuck while driving up hills.  The all wheel drive works perfect even in snow more than a foot deep.  The car never hesitates while on snow covered hills.
Overall, the Subaru Impreza is a great car for the amount of money that you will pay.<br><br>
