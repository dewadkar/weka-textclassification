            I have had my 1997 Ford Taurus for about 6 months now.  I love this car!  It is the most comfortable car I have ever been in.  I origionally bought this car because my father rented one like it when he was visiting NY almost a year ago.  I really liked it when I drove with him.
Mine is silver with gray interior, it's my baby!
The seats are very, very comfortable.  My family fits in it perfectly and it's nice to use for traveling.  The trunk is very large and I love how it opens by itself when I push the button.  The back seats fold down for extra trunk space if needed.
One other thing that I love is the newer Taurus body style, I hated the old boxy looking style.
When I drive this car, it's like I am floating.
If you have a family, this is the car for you.  If you want something sporty and small...look elsewhere!<br><br>
