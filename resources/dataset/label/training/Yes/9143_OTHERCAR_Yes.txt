              I am a very happy owner of a year 2000 Navigator 4X4.  It is simply the most impressive vehicles that I have ever owned.  With the air suspension the ride is very comfortable, compared to A 96 Blazer 4X4 which road like a truck. 
 
  The comfort is outstanding, especially on long trips. I got a few extra options that I could, which weren't too many.  The vehicle comes with just about anything you could want as standard equipment.  

  I especially like the feature that allows you to adjust mirrors, pedals, and seats, and then set a button to remember those settings for up to three drivers.  That way when a different driver gets behind the wheel all they have to do is push their personal button and everything goes to their settings. 

  I also recommend that if you remove the back bench seat, that you get the liner that Lincoln has through their parts department.  It keeps everything nice and neat.

  The only thing that I don't like about my Navigator is that it doesn't have a release button on the inside of the vehicle to open the rear window. Also you have to burn premium gas if you are hauling a trailer or the engine starts to ping.

  Recently had quit a bit of snow here and the way this vehicle handles 
on bad roads is incredible.  The anti lock brakes are very quiet, no 
heavy vibration of the brake pedal, and they live up to their reputation. The automatic 4wheel drive kicks right in and it holds the road like a tank, there is no skidding or swerving.

  I have found my favorite cold weather option, &quot;The Seat Warmer&quot;.  
Nice and toast like.
