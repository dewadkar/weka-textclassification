            I am the queen of used cars, because I can rarely handle a new car payment along with full coverage insurance.  When desperate for a working vehicle, a friend led me to a  92 Nissan Sentra that was for sale by a friend of a friend.  The Nissan in question had been sitting in the driveway for 2 years and was the castoff of an ex-girlfriend. 
 We aired up the tires and jump-started the battery and off we went!
  I have been driving this car for 6 months so far and have had the comfort of feeling secure when away from home. I was most impressed that it had been sitting for so long and had no trouble with it's get-up-and go. 
 I wish I could tell you how long my good fortune will last but I am not a fortune teller.  I only know that this little car is running beautifully with very little work.( it did need a tune up and likes oil a little more than I would like.
 The only thing I would have to admit is a negative - It is very very small when you try to pack three kids in the back seat.  It works only if they are in good moods and are getting along with each other.
 I am a devoted Toyota driver and the Nissan Sentra feels as close to a Toyota as I've ever driven.  I will have to add Nissan to my list of wonderful cars to drive - it handles beautifully and gets great gas mileage. I would have to recommend Nissan as the best used car I ever invested in!<br><br>
