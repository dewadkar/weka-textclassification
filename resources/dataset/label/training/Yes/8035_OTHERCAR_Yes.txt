                 I love my Saturn I got this car used 3 years ago after my other car caught on fire, And was totally destroyed. This car is a 1992, It is excellent on gas, I have not had that many problems with it, except from wear and tear. I had a accident with this car when a individual started backing up on a main road, and hit me in the front of my car. It did not damage the frame since it is metal, and did not do too much damage to the bumper panel. I love the fiberglass on it, It is very durable and economical, as well. I would not trade my car for anything, It has even lasted through two hurricanes as well, and it even survived from going through water up to the middle of the car. and the engine did not quite.<br><br>
