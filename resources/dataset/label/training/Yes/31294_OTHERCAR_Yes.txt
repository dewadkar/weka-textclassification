            The Volvo V70 is a great car, but it has some flaws. It is a solid, safe-feeling wagon that handles crisply. The front and side airbags give you a sense of security, as do the thick doors. The seats are fairly comfortable, and room is decent in the back seat for two adults. Storage space, especially with the back seat down, is roomy--you can fit in two bicycles, or a bunch of furniture.
However, the firm European-style ride isn't for everyone. While it is a joy to drive on smooth roads, on broken or rough surfaces the ride can be unpleasant. You feel every crack between slabs of concrete-surface roads, and potholes can be jarring. 
Moreover, the engine in the base (non-turbo) model is just adequate. On mountainous roads the transmission is forced to downshift frequently to keep the car up to speed.  
Other quirks: The car lacks intermittent wipers, a strange omission for a car in this price range. And the side mirrors are awfully small for a company that emphasizes saftey features.

One thing to consider: A brand new V70 model is due out in April 2000, so you might want to wait for it.<br><br>
