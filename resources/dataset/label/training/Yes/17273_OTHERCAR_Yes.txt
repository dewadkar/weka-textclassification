            I remember seeing an Intrepid many years ago when I was in high school.  It was in a parking lot and I circled it many times vowing to someday own one.  That was probably 1991 or 1992.

When I decided it was time to get a new car, I began looking at cars.  I looked at all kinds of cars, economy, sport, foreign and I realized that all cars looked like bugs.  The only one that didn't was the Dodge Intrepid.  Between the time I started looking and the time I placed my order, they had changed the design, but I later decided that was an improvement.

After getting information from Carpoint.com and Autovantage.com, I ordered my car (the ES model, black) from a local dealership (uck) for a total of $400 over invoice.  I got every option I knew to be available... leather, radio upgrade, sunroof.   It's really great.  

I just have a few complaints:
- dealerships and the whole dealership system suck (I don't need to elaborate)
- the panels dent easily (closed the door with my knew and left a small dimple)
- every so often, the lights remain on even after I've turned the switch off (turning the car off and back on fixes)
- every so often, the window switches don't respond right away (a couple of flicks and they respond)
- occasionally sounds creaky

Also, the dealership told me a CD changer was not available.  The day I picked up my car (special order, they built it to spec. in 5 weeks) I discovered that one had been available.  But now it was too late to add because I didn't have the right faceplate to control it.

And I think I may have already blown one or more infinity speakers.  I think the amp is more powerful than the speakers.  I also scraped the bumper against a bright yellow wall once.  Most of the paint cleaned right off, and a black permanent pen covered the rest.  You have to bend down and get within 2 feet to see where it was.

But the car is fun to drive.  Lots of power, looks incredible.  Great for freeway traffic.  Incredibly comfortable ride.   Powerful air conditioner.  

For 2000, I noticed they've added daytime running lights (about time!).  Probably other enhancements to make it even better.

Given the chance, I'd buy it all over again.<br><br>
