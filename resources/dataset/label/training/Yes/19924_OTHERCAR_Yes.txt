            When I first set foot into this Jaguar, I was instantly in love with it.  The luxurious leather seats, the well set-up dash board, even the location of the stick shift.  These are just a few options in this car that I enjoy, and I will explain more later.<br>First of all, I bought this car about a year ago, and I haven't had to take it into the shop yet.   The engine purrs like a kitten, and you can't even hear it on  the road.  This car is great on gas, getting 29 mpg on the highway, unlike those gas guzzling SUV's.  In the city, this car gets 23 mpg.  Since the engine is so reliable, this car is a good investment, and you'll enjoy the ride.<br><br>Next, the options included in this car are amazing.  The thing that I like most are the voice-activated controls.  You don't have to fumble around behind the steering wheel to turn on the lights or the windshield wipers.  Also, the dashboard is set up nicely.  Every important detail of information can be seen on the dashboard, from whether the trunk is open to whether you have a popped tire  (extra option).  <br><br>This car is great overall.  It is very safe, Jaguar being one of the safest cars on the road.  The interior is very roomy, even for my friends in the back seat.  Overall, this is a great car for a moderate price.  If your looking for luxury on a budget, this is the car for you.<br><br><br>
