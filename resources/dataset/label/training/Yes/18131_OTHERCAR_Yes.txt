            The highlander is really a nice SUV... however, I bought my Highlander (Dec 2002) as my second choice because no Acura dealers would give me an acceptable price cut on the MDX and I was too impatient to not wait for Nissan Murano. This review is based on my very personal experience from the seven months owning the Highlander. I am going to provide my opinions in my way and I am not a professional auto review writer, just so you know. Anyway, read on.

My Toyota Highlander is a V6 Limited 4WD loaded model with Sundown Red exterior color (beautiful in the dusk). The MSRP is just a bit over $35K and I got it for the dealers invoice price... I did a lot of researches and test drives on other SUVs like Acura MDX, GMC Envoy, Mazda Tribute and finally bought the HL. After owning it for 7 months, I found the following things that I could share...

Pros:
Quiet (I mean really quiet engine), comfortable rear seats. Sufficient power for daily driving. Useful heated outside mirrors. Nimble steering control and its overall size is just perfect. Good quality on all interior leathers. Hugh cup holders (and lots of them). My dealer offers free loaner cars if they hold my HL for service more than 1 hour. Solid door closing sound ( = excellent built quality) 

Cons:
- No front passenger power seat (for a $35k  car is not acceptable). 
- Front seat-base cushions a little too short for tall drivers. 
- Super hard interior plastic material, but with tasteful texture. 
- Unfriendly heated front seats with one heating level only (the heated seats tend to shut off itself with an automatic thermo control, NO, you can't keep the heat ON all the time.)
- Need a digital compass (02/18/03: I bought one and installed myself, it is integrated into the rear view mirror, for $180).
- IMO, the Highlander has an Ugly front bumper with two huge holes for fog lights. The fog lights located too high and too close to the headlights (05/30/03: I installed two PIAA Ion Crystal = yellow H3C bulbs that I bought from Japan).
- When the Rear window(s) and sunroof opened, you will hear an aero effect of wind noise (I usually have all back windows closed). Try it, it's really annoying unless you open the front windows to balance it out.
- Front rotating seat armrest take time to get used to of its position. I prefer a fixed mounted center armrest.
- Braking is just so so (soft) and really forgettable, it requires way more distance to stop than the Nissan Murano.
- Fog light bulbs (H3C) are hard to find in regular auto store. You won't find it in Pepboys, Kragen, Autozone, Napa Auto, etc. And it requires too much effort to replace the bulbs (about 30 minutes for two).
- Need a separate rear lift-open window in the lift gate for easier cargo access.

This Highlander is my first Toyota ever. I never really liked Toyota's exterior designing and this one is not an exception. But I have to say that the Toyota has the high quality reputation for a reason. I didn't have any mechanical problems of my HL, and this SUV rides really decent and the engine is so quiet to result I mistaken few times the engine was off when it's on. I guess no other auto manufacture can match Toyota on this (I was a Nissan guy before HL). Body roll at corners is quite noticeable, again, this is a SUV and maybe I am just too picky.

I also did some parts researches on internet because I love car modifications. There is no such web site like "Highlander owners club" in the states so I went oversea to where the Highlander comes from... Japan. In Jap, the highlander is called "Kluger V" and there are many owners clubs for information, for example:
http://www.mirai.ne.jp/~yoshi1/link/link_contents.html

The factory 3-in-1 6 in-dash CDs/Tape/Radio unit is also average in terms of sound quality. (I guess it would be below average compared to those in GMC, or some other similar priced Nissan/Infinity models, the HL doesn't have a factory subwoofer) I found out that the factory Stereo has an amplifier (hidden between cargo floor and back of rear seat), which produces a little power (approx 20~25W peak per channel). My girlfriend��s $9,000 cheaper Mazda Tribute got a better sound system with a factory subwoofer). Replacing the factory stereo system will be one of my upcoming modification works. However, there is no wiring harness for this car to avoid cutting and splicing the factory wires. (05/30/03) I found that American International makes the mounting kits for HL, I haven't try it yet but will update.

My gas mileage is low, on average. 16 mpg would be best in town and only 20mpg on highway. Never get the mileage as advertised by Toyota. Although I consider to change tire/wheel package because 225/70/16 is a bit too small by my standard.

The other observation: anyone notices the factory fog lights are too dark? I mean its 35W power output for fog light is kind of joke. The owners manual listed the light bulb is a H3... and good luck, you will find yourself nothing in a typical auto store to replace the factory fog light bulb if it ever broke. (of course you can always go back to the dealer, but they charge you $25/pair of 35w bulbs and you better learn how to replace them or the dealer will charge you again for 1 hour of labor) The button line is, if you want a decent pair of Highlander's H3C fog light bulbs (say from PIAA) with 55W output, good luck! You need to have sources.

Update: 
(09/09/03) My Japan imported Highlander body kit has been installed for two months now... It looks just fabulous and I got so many admirations from other drivers. It is something I didn��t experience before the new body kit. (http://www.cardomain.com/member_pages/view_page.pl?page_id=401443&make_type_query=make%3DToyota&model_brand_query=model%3DHighlander&tree=Toyota%20Highlander) 

(06/25/03) I just purchased the body kit for my Highlander from Japan. This will change the Highlander's looking dramatically, believe me, you will know why when check the photos.

(05/30/03) Check this site:

There are two different styles of body kit. I am trying to find a way to get myself a set of "Elegant Cruising Package" from Japan. It might be pricey but I think it is worthy. However, Even worse, I found one (and only) private import company in the states sells this kit for way way over their buying price, but if you are interested, check this out:
http://shop.store.yahoo.com/lexuspa...lelcruispa.html
The only other place you can buy Highlander body kit: (I don't really like the bumper attachment design though)
http://www.erebunicorp.com/ge/toyhighlander.htm

I never understand why people are willing to pay the extra $4k to $5k (above invoice) to buy the MDX. Maybe they are RICH, maybe it's me being "sour grape" but I just can't throw away my hard earned money into dealers' pockets). I skipped the top choice MDX because its ridiculously-non-negotiable price and also the dealers' ugly faces. I am not regreting of buying the Highlander at all, after a half of a year. The exterior appearance problem will be solved after I install the body kit so the Highlander will look mean and bad!!!



UPDATE 07/18/2003:

I got my body kit (Elegant Cruising Package) installed last weekend. Man, it's gorgeous!!! I'll take some photos to share and post the link here soon, stay tune....
