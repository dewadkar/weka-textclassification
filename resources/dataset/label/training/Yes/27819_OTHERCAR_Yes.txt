            I had test-driven (and dismissed) about half-a-dozen other luxury and near-luxury models, having discovered (as prior Lexus owners are wont do do) that the Lexus driving experience is somewhat addictive.  Finally, I had determined that I probably wanted a GS/300, and was visiting a dealership one night for a test spin. 

I wasn't as thrilled as I thought I'd be...probably because I really wanted a GS/400.  I allowed the salesman to work a deal, but had pretty much decided that I wouldn't sign that evening.  I was strolling about the lot while he crunched numbers, and There She Sat:  a silver-blue SC300, with black leather interior.  I knew instantly that I <i>would</i> drive that car at least once before I died. Off we went.

Now, experienced car buyers know to maintain a certain defensive stoicism during test drives, perhaps even hemming and hawing about perceived imperfections, while the salesman dutifully waxes enthusiastic about the experience and tries to coax emotional attachment.  

My salesman couldn't get a word in edgewise.  I was way, way too busy gushing and cooing about the whole thing, and fervently mentioning features to him that he ought to pass along to his next prospect.Then, on a long straightaway, he showed me The BatSwitch. 

We pulled up behind a three-cab caravan of 18-wheelers, and he said, &quot;Get in the passing lane...now give it a little gas...now take your hand and pop the (walnut) shift knob to the left...&quot;  whereupon the car did everything but open a jumpgate to Babylon 5.  

Seriously, the quiet hum of the engine was instantly replaced by a confident (and somewhat feral) snarl, and we moved from sixty to ninety miles per hour, in what I would guess was about 3-5 seconds.  A tenth of a minute later,  I slapped the shift again as I moved to the right, and my little starship settled smoothly into the normal space-time continuum, and that whole fleet of Klingons was history.

I knew by now that this car and I were married, and I didn't care if I had to spend the rest of my life eating tuna fish in my underwear.  Back to the dealership we went, and then my salesman delivered the coup-de-grace:  This was one of two '98 models he had left, a manufacturer's demo, and it was to be mine for a little over $9,000 off the sticker.  

And what else shall I say?  Should I mention the twelve-disc, 8-speaker Nakamichi sound system?  The twin 8-way seats with heaters and power lumbar adjustment?  The relentlessly accurate variable-ratio steering with 4-way power adjustable stalk?  Two-driver seat/wheel/rearview  memory?  Four-disc ABS?  Zero maintenance problems?  The fact that a ten-hour road trip results in all the physical fatigue of a bread run to the corner Wag-a-Bag?

And what would I change?  Would I have preferred the 290 horses of the SC400 to my own 225 plant?  My Inner Child gives an unqualified Yeah Buddy, but my Inner Parent says I'd be dead by now, or in prison.  One thing I might have tried:  the SC300 is the only Lex available with a five-speed.  They are hard to come by, but professional reviewers say that _nothing_ comes close to a five-speed SC300 for sheer joy; not even Big Sister.  And, every once in awhile, the automatic on this car outsmarts itself and lurches slightly on an upshift.  Though it costs one the smug joy of The BatSwitch, I'd be tempted.

Potential lessees  should be aware of another fact:  the SC body style is the oldest in the product line, essentially unchanged since the model's introduction.  I happen to think that it ranks up with the original VW Scirocco and the '74 Pontiac Grand Prix (yes, I'm a geezer) as one of the great examples of aesthetic tuning.  However, the body style <i>is</i>  probably overdue for some serious rethinking, and nothing kicks the legs from underneath a car's residual value like the debut of a major redesign.

As for you?  Test-drive one on a lark if you'd like, but be warned: to drive ANY Lexus, even briefly, is to alter one's perspective on driving.  Permanently.<br><br>
