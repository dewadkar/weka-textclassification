            With a growing family we knew that we needed something bigger to haul all 3 boys and ourselves when we went out to the inlaws ranch or anywhere else for that matter.  Our dinky 1985 4x4 Ranger just wasn't cutting it anymore.  The kids were getting bigger and outgrowing the carseats and wanting a little more leg room.  You know how siblings get when another sibling &quot;accidently&quot; touches the others leg!
We looked and looked and finally settled on a 1988 Ford Ranger Extended Cab 4x4.  It fits this family perfectly :)  The kids are no longer bickering (well not as much as they were anyway!) and we can all fit inside very comfortably!
It has 5 seatbelts, so we ALL have something holding us in &quot;just incase&quot; something happens.  That's the main thing I love about it!  It is also very easy to drive, good on gas (which is a plus when the hubby has to drive 16 miles one way to work!), has really nice interior design, and it was very affordable!
My hubby has been a Ford man all his life..henceforth the reason we only have Ford vehicles!  I wouldn't change it for the world though :)  I even drive this pickup around all the time!  Especially on long trips, to go shopping or just to drive around town!
