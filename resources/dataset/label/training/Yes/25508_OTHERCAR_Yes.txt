            I purchased a new 1999 Mazda B4000 SE 4x4 this past June, and have had nothing but good experiences with it.  My previous vehicle was a 1996 Honda Passport, with which I was slightly dissatisfied on quality and reliability.  I test drove and did research on many makes and models of pickups before settling on the B4000. I found the size of the B4000 to be just about perfect for my needs.  Like many &quot;city dwellers&quot;, I only occasionally use the truck for hauling, and when I do it's for things like planting materials or furniture.  While I liked the Ford F150 a lot, I just couldn't see having a truck that big for the once every few years I might need to haul something huge.  Plus I saved $8,000 over a comparable F150.

I got the 4.0L V6 engine with automatic transmission, which I highly recommend.  I test drove both the 4 cyl and smaller V6, and both seemed sluggish.  This one's got all the power you will need.  I don't use it for towing, but I have no doubt it has enough power to tow a boat or small trailer with ease.  The new 5-speed automatic transmission is outstanding!  I've never felt a smoother automatic transmission in any truck, or most cars for that matter.

The interior of the truck is very comfortable, the seats have good support, the CD stereo system is great, and all of the controls are well designed.  The &quot;shift on the fly&quot; 4-wheel drive option on this truck is awesome!  My Passport had a sliding shifter that you practically had to slam forward to get into 4x4 mode.  This truck has a nifty toggle switch that you can use to shift into and out of 4x4 mode up to 60 mph.  

My truck has the 4-door option, which I can't recommend strongly enough.  Don't buy one without the 4-door option!!!  It's only a couple of hundred dollars more, but it's worth 10 times as much.  There is a lot of room behind the seats, but it's completely worthless without the back doors.  We've started using the truck for weekly grocery shopping, and there's plenty of room back there for a full load.  

My only complaint so far is that it gets poor gas mileage (about 15 mpg city), but I suppose that's expected.  I use the truck for my daily driver, and I do spend a lot on gas compared to the typical sedan.  It also rides a little rough on bumpy roads when the bed is empty.

If you're looking for a good utility truck for medium to small loads, you can't go wrong with this one.  The quality is outstanding, it has lots of amenities, and it's easy to drive.  It's plenty comfortable for day-to-day driving, although the gas mileage is rather poor.  I highly recommend this in comparison to any other compact truck out there.<br><br>
