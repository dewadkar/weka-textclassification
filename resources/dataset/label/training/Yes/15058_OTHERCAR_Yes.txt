            I bought this digital camera from a sony outlet for $300 a year ago. Since then I am quite happy and satisfied with my decision to buy this.
important feature i love about this camera is that it uses 3.5 inch floppy disks to store the photos. this media is cheaper and easy to carry. I usually take a dozen floppies and it is quite handy. This camera has a inbuilt flash which can be set in automatic or manual modes. 

I can also set various color themes for my photos such as b&w,sepia,solarized etc. It is quite interesting to see features such has solarized photo in this low budget model.

There are various setting for lighthing adjustments such as landscape, night mode and 3 other modes. 

The on screen battery meter shows the battery time in minutes which is the awesome feature very few cameras in the market offer.You can switch between camera mode and play mode with a simple slide button. Play mode offers inbuilt features like disk copy, deleting selected/all pictures and even formatting the disk. So you do not need to have a floppy drive at all times to use disk utilities.

Pictures are quite OK when take within a distance to 6 ft. Long shots are blurred. I think this might be because the effective megapixel count is only 0.3 (though the total mp count is 1.3 megapixel). Colors are satisfactory.

This camera makes some noise while it writes to the floppy disk, but i dont mind it.

Over all this is a good buy for a beginner who want to own a decent camera. I would suggest this to anyone. But a better decision would be to buy FD-75 or FD-92 models which offer the option of using a memory stick along with a standard floppy disk option.
