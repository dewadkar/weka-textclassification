            This past December I leased a Saturn SL2.  I have purchased new cars in the past and have never had a less stressful experience.  My salesperson was courteous, knowledgeable and not pushy.  I was able to take my time and not feel pressured to make a decision. The price is set and there is none of this going back and forth. I have been driving it for the past few months and can honestly say I like the way it handles and the comfort of the drive.  It has a sporty appeal to it and not too bad on gas. Mine is a four door and I would recommend you check out the four door if you have more than two in your family for the ease of getting in and out.  There is plenty of trunk space and not that difficult to bend and retrieve your groceries or whatever from the trunk. 
I had my first maintenance check and that was a breeze.  I purchased the maintenance program and recommend you do so.  You will receive your mileage checks and oil changes with no charge for the 3 yr. lease.  It will pay for itself in the long run. It will also will help when you turn your car in and they will have record of the fact you took care of this car.  
They also offered free car wash at my dealership for as long as I own my Saturn.  I do not know if that is standard for all dealerships but I am pleased.  I can not say enough about the service and the quality of the vehicle.  If you want a compact car, I would definitely check the Saturn out first.  I have had some nightmare experiences with other dealerships and their service departments.  I will now continue to do my purchasing of cars with Saturn and if you want a hassle free experience you will consider it too!<br><br>
