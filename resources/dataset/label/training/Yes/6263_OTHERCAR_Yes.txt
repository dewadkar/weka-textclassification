            After driving my Pontiac Bonneville SSE, which I truly love, for the last ten years, it was time for me to get behind the wheel of a pickup truck again.  I love Gm products, so it was the only truck I shopped for.  Wow! This one is loaded, SLE, 3 door extended cab, 4X4, 5.3 liter, Z71, Auto-transfer case, premium sound, limited slip rear (A must), power seats and more.

The last new pickup I bought was an 87 Chevy Silverado, which we still have in service; my daughter stole it from me when I bought the SSE.  Well the ride of the pickups just keeps getting better and better.  This really rides like a full size luxury sedan, this even with the optional Z71 offroad suspension package.  This truck as plenty of power, you will find yourself making those quick pull outs more often leaving the guy behind you in the dust.  Gas mileage has been gradually improving during break in.  From 12 to about 16 during the first 5,000 miles, 80% of which is local traffic.

There is plenty of neat gadgetry as well, you will love the electrchromatic mirror, with compass and outside temperature, heated mirrors, power seats, auto electronic transfer case and more.  Mine has two-tone paint; the trim and paint were perfect at delivery. The cloth interior trim looks great and is comfortable, even with the bucket seats and center console.  Also, one last thing, GMC seems to be determined to make their customers happy, I have never seen the dealerships, salespeople, and service departments as caring and courteous as they are today.
