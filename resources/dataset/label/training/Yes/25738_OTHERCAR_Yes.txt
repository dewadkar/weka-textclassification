            It is like a bubble car and is rounded off and looks COOL!!!

My second car, in Cancun,  was a Beetle, it was a mint green model the engine purred rather than roared. which is one of the best features for the ecology for the new millenium. In performance, the Beetle was a joy to drive. The steering was light, and the car gripped the road well. If I needed to overtake quickly, it did not let me down.

The public seem to love Beetles. People stared as I drove along Kukulcan blvd. 

Some people stopped me in car parks to admire it, I enjoyed my rented Beetle experience so much.

If you have that amount of money in your budget for a new car, you must have one but if you donï¿½t you can also rent it for a day on the beach. It has now become a car for rich ones rather than for a true VW enthusiast. 

What I like best of it is the powerful engine of a V6, the color and the stereo.
