            This automobile is a bit difficult to describe.  Obviously it should be sold as a luxury sedan with enough room to seat 5 people comfortably, but it has more positive qualities to offer.  Not only is it stylish, roomy, and (jeez, now I'm starting to sound like a damn commercial).  Anyway, I am a college student and my fater has owned 3 different Camrys in the past 5 years.  Last Christmas, he bought the 1999 model and last August, my stepmother bought the same exact one, but in a more intriguing color.  

Both have enough power to keep your speed demon side at ease, and because its roomy enough for the family, they can adjust as well.  

Personally, my father has never had any problems with his Camry to date and he keeps going back and releasing a new model every chance he can get because he loves them so much.  Test drive one if you get the chance and see what I'm talking about.  <br><br>
