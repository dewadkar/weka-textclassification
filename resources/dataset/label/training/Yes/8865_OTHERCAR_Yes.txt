            When I went out to look for a new car for clients and entertaining purposes as well as for myself, I knew for sure the Accord was for me.  The model I ended up getting was the EX V-6, the top of the line version.

First the bad: Well, it's styling is too conservative.  I would have preferred something that looked a little more aggressive.  And its wheels are small compared to Camry and Taurus.

Now the good:  I was able to bargain the car down to $23,000 compared to the list price of $28,000.  I got quite a deal, I believe, for the price.  My car came with very comfy leather, and the front seat featured lumbar support and power seats.  Though the front passengar didn't have power seats for some reason.  The auto climate control was also very easy to use and figure out, no need to flip through the owner's manual.  Another neat feature of the climate control is when you hit the defrost button, the AC automatically comes on.  The car also came with power moonroof with tilt as well as the usual power options.  One of the features I most liked was the volume controls mounted on the steering wheel.  It was nice to able to turn up the volume or flip through the radio or CD without having to take your eyes off the road or your hands off of the steering wheel.  It also came with a powerful six speaker system.  Another thing my car came with was remote keyless entry, which is an extra convenience that I can no longer live without.  Anything else?  Of course, safety was a key issue when I was looking for a car.  The Accord comes with ABS, dual front airbags and dual side airbags.  The airbags are built to deploy at two different speeds, depending on severity of crash and if you are wearing a seatbelt or not.  And the side airbags only deploy if your seats are reclined in the full upright position.  This car also has tons of power.  It comes with a 200 horsepower 3.0 liter V-6.  This car produces more horsepower per liter than any other car I researched(camry, taurus, altima, maxima, galant, malibu, impala).  Stick your foot all the way down on the gas pedel and you'll feel the g-forces.
