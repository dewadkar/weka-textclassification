            When Volkswagon came out with this new model, I was impressed. I still had the hard job of convincing my husband he had been a loyal Honda customer.  So when we went car shopping I convinced him to take a test drive.  Well now we are the happy owners of a 1999 V6 Passat.  So as you can imagine the test drive went well.  We drove both the 4 cylinder and the V6.  We felt we were getting so much more with the V6 it was smooth and felt like a sports car. We compared to the Hondas, Nissans, and the only thing we felt we could measure this car against was the more expensive German cars like Mercedes and BMW, but in our price range.

INTERIOR / EXTERIOR
Well like I said above you definitely get the unique German luxury feel and look. The burl wood dash, stainless gearbox, and I'm sorry but I love the violet and red interior lighting. The outside has a great body style saying &quot;SPORTY&quot; while the inside leaves plenty of room for a family.

THE FEEL
This car drives like nothing we had ever driven before and only imagined existed in cars that cost lots more.  We were surprised how smooth and the pep this car had, It clung to the road even on tight curves and we couldn't even hear the gears change as we were up to 80mph before we knew it. My husband especially liked the triptronic transmission, allowing you to shift manually or by automatic. Needless to say  after we felt and drove the car we bought it, that is what did it for us.

RELIABILITY
We have had a couple inconveniences with our Passat, Mostly related to our dealership and their availability to parts. In this our second year we have had the fuel gauge replaced and just recently at 35,000 miles the hydraulic pump to the timing belt, all at no charge, but because of the dealerships misdiagnosis and lack of the parts to fix it, it spent more days in  the shop than necessary.  They also pushed replacing the brakes on our last visit at the tune of $560 for all four.  All other dealerships were at least $100 dollars cheaper, and then only to find out we didn't need brakes at all from the same dealership a week later.

OVERALL
The Pros far outweigh the Cons, Like the title says we can't replace it with anything else, nothing would compare.  Our four year old calls it our &quot;Race Car.&quot; We feel like we have finally found a Family sports car, with a roomy interior and a sleek sporty exterior, for a great price.
