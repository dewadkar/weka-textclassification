            I have been sports car fanatic for a long time.  My current sports car is
a 25th Anniversary Trans Am, but what does this have to do with the Odyssey.  Well as it would be, My wife and I have decided to start a family, and as it goes now, we have no room for any kids in our vehicles.
We researched all types of vehicles from sedans, sport utilities, and minivans.
We came to the conclusion that a minivan would suite our needs very nicely so that is what we began researching.  As many of you, we found the Honda
Odyssey to be the best pick, and me being the power buff in the family, loved the 210 Horsepower engine.

We went to our closest Honda dealer which was in Joplin, Missouri,  and took the test drive of the demo vehicle.  We loved the new Navigational system in the 2000, we loved how quiet the van was, and I loved the handling.  For
a minivan this thing could turn and corner with the best of vehicles.
We loved it and put our order in.  We ordered a Deep Velvet Blue Pearl
Odyssey for delivery on April of 2000.  We ordered almost every option which took our van a little over $30,000.  Our excitement had started.

We were all set and had the order on the way.  We told friends, family, and anyone else that would listen to us talk about it.

Our van came in and we are more impressed than when we first test drove one.  We were told that the Deep Velvet Blue Pearl had been discontinued and had to pick a new color.  We picked Canyon Stone Silver as our next choice, but to our amazement Honda came through.  Our dealer called us and told us our van was here and that it was BLUE.  They were right, it is Blue and we are gleeming.  Go Honda.  I have been impressed with the whole buying experience of our Odyssey despite the lack of discounts, but we did manage to get 500.00 dollars off the MSRP.

In conclusion, The Odyssey is the only choice for someone wanting a little bit of everything from their vehicle.  Those who have sport utes do not know what they are missing because the Odyssey in my opinion is a Sport Utility Vehicle.  What you get is:  Acceleration(210 hp), Comfort, Handling, Firm sporty ride, quietness, roominess, economy, low insurance rates, safety, sleek design, high technology, and most of all RELIABILITY.
What else could anyone want.  This is a good vehicle for everyone, not just someone with a family.  I love mine and I know you will love yours to.  If you don't have one yet, get in line and get ready for a ride that will cure anyone of their minivanitis.<br><br>
