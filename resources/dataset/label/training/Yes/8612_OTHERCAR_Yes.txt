            It is awesome!  It had to be designed by a mom... If you were traveling from home to say Yellowstone park, where would all the luggage be? in the back, where would you want the spare tire to be during a flat? yep, behind the driver in the floor where there is no luggage.  Pretty neat?

if you had teenagers in the middle and teenagers in the back, how do you compromise about the movie? bring two, there are two power supply outlets, one in the front, one in the rear.
 
Who&#146s back is always strained getting infant seats in and out of the car? Moms.. She does all the shopping. Car seat in, car seat out, car seat in, car seat out.  Then toddler in toddler out... they are the exact height for a 5 ft 7 mom to load the kids without stooping to buckle.
 
Diapers are never a thing of the past... wouldn't it be nice to have a sanitary place to change the little tyke? How about lifting the hatch, and flipping the backseat towards the back and now you have a comfortable padded changing table, and it has a back so that the little one can&#146t roll away.  Pretty cozy huh? 
 
Not enough for you? You can sit on the cozy seat and have a picnic lunch or set a child on the back seat with the hatch open to tie a shoe.
 
Okay... so your going to the store to fetch yet another 'some assembly required' furniture, where are you going to put it? Well no problem, the seat folds completely down into the floor leaving tons of room.  (I can get a full size futon in there. ;-)
 
Still not enough room? You can slide a twin or full size bed in between the two split apart seats, not available with the American models that give you just bench seats.... ooooooh still not enough room... take out the children car seats, fold down the middle van seats, and flip them up to sit snuggle against the back of the front seats and you now have wwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy to much cargo room.
 
Vacation? Luggage rack on top.. YIPPEE
 
Child Safety:
Magnus can put his arm in the door as it is closing and not get hurt. It has a child safety that protects the babies, no opening from the inside, no pinched fingers and broken arms, and it is so easy, a 2 year old can open and close without slamming..  I hate it when a teenager gets out of the car and feels the need to slam the door as hard as possible to close it, with the it is just lift the handle and let it go... 5 car seat tethers.. 5! 7 shoulder harness seat belts.... LATCH system built in... no more playing with seatbelts... no claspy thingies, no cinchers, no safety seat checks, in and out slick as taking the stroller out... and speaking of strollers
 
third row magic seat, and room for TWO 2 TWO full size monster travel system strollers AND a trike!   will also hold easily a Duo Glider, could even get two in there!  Downside? payments... $500 a month.. But the insurance is the same as for a 1994 Ford Taurus. go figure.
 
Extremely safe:
I was rear ended a week ago, got a tiny little crease in the bumper, hardly noticeable by a Toyota 4runner. The tap was less than 5 MPH so the air bags did not deflate, and the children infant seats were not in the car at the time.  

Anti theft... immobilizer... have to have the electronic key to move it.. Since this is a popular car, and thus popular to steal, I like this feature. yeah... 
 
Excellent fuel mileage:
V6.. lots of power.. Mileage... I get 10 days to the fill up, and that is  averaging $13 - 20 a tank.  20mpg... city driving... i.e., less than 5 mile trips and stop and go.

ding magnet:
for some reason, this car is the first one that I have ever owned that is a true ding magnet. I got more dings (passenger mirror-close encounter with the garage door frame, passenger sliding door - close encounter with the lawn mower, front spoiler - close encounter with a loading ramp, rear hatch - close encounter with the car wash brushes, rear quarter panel - close encounter with a mailbox, rear hatch - close encounter with something (dent was there when I came out of the mall, rear bumper, close encounter with the overhead garage door) I have had a minivan before, drove a 1987 Plymouth Voyager for 7 years and never got one single dent, ding or scratch, it is not the size, it is just some of the softest sheet metal I have ever encountered.

**UPDATE**   **UPDATE**   **UPDATE**     **UPDATE**     
We sustained a severe crash, leaving the ice roads at 70 mph, down a ditch, over a 10 ft deep ravine, through 5 fence posts, one taking out the passenger slider door window, and gliding past a guide wire to a telephone pole, and stopping 10 yards short of a busy rail road.  

Both front air bags deployed perfectly.  the safety glass dissolved into popcorn size pieces all over the baby in the Evenflo Apollo car seat.

injuries? not one scratch. no one in the car was hurt. the van took a serious beating, the front bumper broke in half and the rear bumper flew completely off, the side of the door that took the brunt of the damage never caved in.  the cabin of the van was in great shape.  the outside of the van did not fare as well but considering the amount of damage, I am sold!  I am ordering a new one! the Honda Odyssey can not be beat for safety!
