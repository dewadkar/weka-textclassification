            The Nissan Quest is a wonderful travel experience!!  I�m a 39 year old disabled, mother of two.  I have a scooter that fits nicely in the back behind the seat.  We moved the rear seat to the middle and removed the middle seat. 

Another thing I like about the Quest is the fact that it is low enough for me to get into without much trouble.  The comfort of the seats eases the agony of a long ride.  I�m a heavy person and some of the minivans we looked at had cheap seats that actually scrunched up on the sides when you sat down.  The Quest seats have held up marvelously.  That was one of the reasons we bought it, plus it was less expensive than most of the other minivans.  We bought our Quest in October of 94 (it�s a 95 model) and my friends think it looks like one of the newer models.  

I love the easy handling of my van.  Also, the fact that it is dependable is a big plus for me, being disabled and female I don't ever worry about being stranded.  We've never had trouble with the van.  We had to have the normal 60,000 mile timing belt change (which was rather expensive) and the recall on the tail light assembly, but other than that, it's been superb!

When we are ready to buy a new van, it�s going to be a Quest.
