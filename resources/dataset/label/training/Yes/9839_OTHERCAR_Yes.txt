            My old wagon was on it's last legs when I decided it would probably more economical to buy a newer car than to keep paying out thousands in repairs.  

I was researching used cars on-line when I stumbled on a review for a Daewoo Nubira.  To my surprise a new was about the same price as some of the 3-4 year old cars I had been researching.  Not only that, but this car came fully loaded.  It automatically came with heat/air, ABS brakes, CD stereo with security features, keyless entry/alarm, and more safety features than I can name.  I was sold even before I entered the showroom.

When we took it for a test drive we found it drove like a dream.  Especially, after my last car.  It steers and maneuvers so smoothly.  Everything on the dash is easily accessible and it even has reading lights so you don't have to struggle to read a map.  

Even though the exterior is about the same as my old car it had much more interior space.  It feels so roomy and comfortable.  The space for the spare tire is large enough to hold a regular size tire and still have extra room.  There are also extra compartments in the rear for storage as well as rings to hook bungee cords or ropes for tying things down.  

This is a great family car, my nephew loves to ride in it.  My mother uses it to drive her senior citizen clients on errands and they rave about it.  Or, if your like me and your &quot;kids&quot; walk on four legs and bark, it also comes in handy.  

Even if you are not sure about a wagon, I would highly recommend the other Daewoo cars.  They come with a great warranty, which I've already used on my 3,000 and 6,000 mile check-ups.  The customer service is wonderful, with follow-up calls and letters to make sure you are pleased with your car and any service provided.  

Don't let the price tag fool you, just because the price is low, this is in no way a cheap made car.  I've had my car for over six months and I definitely love my Nubira     <br><br>
