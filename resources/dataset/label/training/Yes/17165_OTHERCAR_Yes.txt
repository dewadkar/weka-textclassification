            It has been exactly a year since I bought my 1990 Honda Prelude, and I have to say I could never had asked for a better car.  During this past year I have put 12,000 miles on my car, but you wouldn't even know it.  This past summer I took the car all over Washington and Oregon, it was just me, my car, and the open road, and the car did perfectly.  This car takes curves as if they are its best friends, it goes up mountain passes as if they were small hills, and all I can do is take it all in and smile.  I smile because no longer do I have to drive in the slow lane, no longer do I have to be careful going around corners at high speeds, and no longer do I have to fill up the gas tank every single week.
The car may be ten years old but it still feels new to me, the original speakers still work perfectly, the power sunroof never fails to open, and the front seats support you no matter how long of a trip you have before you.  My air condition still works, and temperature controls are very easily accessible, as is every other control.
Outside the car has retained its new car look, the paint is still perfect looking, the headlights still pop up whenever needed, and its sleek design can still compete with the best.
I have only a few problems with the car, one the back seat is tiny, it is better used as a storage place than a place for people.  Right now the only living things I can fit back there are my dogs since they have no legs dangling down.  My other problem is the passage way from the trunk to the back seat, it is not very wide.  The whole back seat folds down but then instead of it being a square opening, they made it more circular, which makes it very hard to put a square object through.  Sometimes I feel as if I am playing the shape game that babies play, where they try to put the right shape into the right opening. My last problem with the car is that it tends to skid on wet pavement, living in Seattle, I drive in rain a lot, and when going around corners I have to be very careful, or else the car will skid on me.
I would recommend this car to people who like to have fun, and don't have to carry a lot of other people around with them ever, to people who like reliability and love to go fast, but most of all to people who can appreciate this car and take good care of it, because if you take good care of it, it will take really good care of you.
