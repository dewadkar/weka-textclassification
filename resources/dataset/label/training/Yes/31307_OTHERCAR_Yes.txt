            The new BMW 2002 X5 is definitely the best sports utility truck I have ever driven.  As soon as you see it on the road or in someone&#146s driveway you automatically look because you like the way it looks.  However, the best part of the X5 is the inside of it.  My car is black on black; meaning black on the outside and the interior has black leather.  The dash is very easy to read at all times of the day and night, and the buttons are very easy to locate and to identify.  

	Another great part about the X5 is the performance for a truck.  My car is the 3.0 Liter with the 6 cylinders.  BMW has made the 4.6 liter so that they would have a truck that could be compared to the Mercedes ML500 AMG that&#146s is equipped with a 5.0 liter engine and is priced around the mid 40&#146s.  The BMW X5 4.6is liter also is stellar in the performance area too, having around the same 0-60 time as the ML500 at 6.2.  

	The BMW X5 has many options that make for a great car.  The first one that I would recommend would be the xenon headlights, that give the car an even more stylish look if that is possible.  Some other options would be roof racks, and all those other little things that someone might want to have around.  Another, great accessory would be the CD player which goes along great with the cars sound system.  There is also a very neat gadget in the box between the seats.  Once you open it you will see little CD holders.  If you press the little button in the middle of each CD holder, a little extension of the holder will pop up, and that is where you can store 6 extra CD&#146s.  After you put CD&#146s in each little holder a little light will go on, at the top of the holder so that you can see what holder already has a CD in it.  Another helpful gadget is called the system.  When you are driving the car in reverse or forwards there are little sensors in the rear and front of the car that let you know how close or far away you are from an object.  This works by using little speakers in the car, so if you are to close in the front right of the car to an object, a beeping sound will appear.  As you get closer to the item the beeping gets closer together until you hit a solid beet when you are 12 inches away.

	When driving the 3.0 Liter X5 you can tell that this car was made by BMW by the way it drives.  I take it around the curves as if it is a regular car, but its not, its better than a regular car.  It holds the ground better than most regular cars, because the great technology of BMW.  The seats are very comfortable and the car is very easy to access from the outside.  The trunk of the car may appear to small when you look at it but when you start putting items in it you will see that it is much larger than you think.  Another great accessory that you might want is a black nylon pad for your trunk that will protect the trunk from getting dirty.  This can be located at your BMW dealer or in numerous BMW magazines.  Overall, I believe that the 2002 X5 is greatest truck ever created and if you are looking for a sports truck, the BMW X5 should be #1 on your list.
