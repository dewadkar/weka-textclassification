               Through an online promotion, we had the opportunity to test drive an Oldsmobile in exchange for a $50 gift card to Blockbuster Video.  There were 5 vehicles we could choose from, so we decided this would be the one.  We currently drive a mini-van, a 1989 Chevy Astro, so if we chose to buy a car, this would be the type we'd need.

   There was a Silhouette on the showroom floor, which is the one I had the chance to look over.  While my hubby did the driving, I stayed with our kids in the play room at the dealership.  :)  The van is your typical family mini-van, but with some unique features.

   The van would hold six people.  The two front seats have a small mesh netting between them for storage.  I'd prefer the console we purchased for $6 at Wal*Mart.  This bag didn't look like it could hold much.  There are 4 rear seats, in two rows.  Each side can fold forward, providing 2 cup holders.  There is a sliding rear door on each side of this van.  On the left side, if the gas tank door is open, the door will not slam into it, but gently bounces off.  Pretty neat feature.  Of course the van features automated door and window controls.  The model my husband test drove had a small television installed, but the floor model did not.  The car I saw had a maroon exterior with tan interior, and that combination worked well.  Seats were leather, not plush, a plus with small children because that's easier to clean if there's a spill.

   I think this would make a very good family car, but at $33,000 you would not catch us trying to purchase it new!  We would probably buy it used, however, if we were ready to buy our next automobile.<br><br>
