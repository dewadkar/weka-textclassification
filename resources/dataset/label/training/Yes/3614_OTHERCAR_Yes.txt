            My husband and I were searching for a sporty, yet family-sized car when we came across the Pontiac Grand Prix family.  I am a real estate agent and my Nissan Sentra wasn't practical for my larger clients.  We test drove the Pontiac Grand Prix's different versions (GT, SE, GTP) and immediately fell in love.  The car is sporty looking with a beautiful low profile and spoilers.  The GTP has a 240 HP engine that hit 0-70 within 7 seconds.  We wound up buying the GT, 200 HP, because with three children, there was no need for the extra speed.  The children fit perfectly in the back seat with room to spare.  The legroom is more than ample for both back seat passengers and front passenger.  I love the smooth ride, the sports car feel and the fast pick up.  I can pull onto a freeway onramp and hit 70 by the time I merge onto the freeway.  

The braking in this car is superior.  It has four wheel disc braking and this car comes to halt quickly, yet with subtle ease.  There have been a few rear-end close calls, but the Grand Prix quietly and quickly stops on a dime.  The steering is also great, as the car can make a U-turn without any worries of hitting the opposite curb on streets of normal width.  The steering reminds me of much more expensive sports cars I've test driven, but also has the feel of much more expensive luxury cars!

The stereo system delivers great sound that encompasses you as you drive.  While one down side to buying our GT is that it did not come equipped with a CD player, it plays cassettes clear and crisp.  The speakers deliver awesome bass, perfect for my Dru Hill tape and my &quot;Boston&quot; cassette has never seen such crisp treble.

Our car is painted silver titanium, so it turns goldish color at different angles.  We originally wanted either bronze, gold or hunter green, but since there were none in stock, we opted for the silver.  Honestly, we couldn't have made a better color choice.  Scratches and &quot;dings&quot; don't show up as much as they would with the other colors.    The interior is gray velour and spills wipe up with a damp wash cloth.  With children, another VERY important point to consider.

The only thing I dislike about the car is that the front passenger seat is not comfortable for my back.  The drivers seat has lumbar support and adjustment, but the passenger side does not and my back tends to get stiff on long rides.

All in all, I highly recommend the Pontiac Grand Prix GT and am proud to be an owner of one myself.  I think we will be Pontiac Owners forever!  I recommend this car to persons like myself who want a large car with a sporty flair.  Anyone who loves speed but doesn't want to pay for sports car insurance will love what they get with the Grand Prix.<br><br>
