            This is the one I have been waiting for.  So, I'll start by admitting that my 1999 Escalade is my ultimate toy, but I won't be bashful about giving you the good and bad.

Although on the expensive side, the Escalade is in a price range with the Lincoln Navigator.  The Navigator was the only other luxury SUV that I seriously considered and test drove before buying my Escalade.  Sure, I know than GMC makes a comparable vehicle, but I'm an executive.  Style is important too, Cadillac style.  I bought the Escalade for a number of reasons including: I liked the way it handled, the seats comfortably adjusted from tall to shorter drivers (avoiding a common complaint about knees hitting the dash when the seat is pulled forward - a sore point with my wife), the looks [you wanted honest], and the toys.

First the looks: I wanted a full sized luxury SUV.  Not something like the Mercedes M-Class SUV that looks like it shrunk in the wash cycle.  If you're going to part with the cash for an Escalade, don't stop without going for the upgraded 17&quot; wheels.  They make the single biggest improvement in visual appeal.  I also went for the gold package and the interior wood package but skipped the heavy iron cattle guards.  A young relative trying to explain some of the latest slang terms to me got into the Escalade and said, &quot;Dude, you know that word 'dawg?'  This - is - DAWG!&quot;

The toys are an impressive lot led off by the On-Star GPS (global positioning satellite) system.  NEVER STOP FOR DIRECTIONS AGAIN! [A married man's dream come true] Seriously, this is the best system I have seen with a combination of safety, convenience and customer support literally at the touch of a button.  The first day I had the Escalade we picked it up at the dealership and drove off for a three day tour of central Texas.  In the middle of No-Where, between Burnet and San Angelo, we took one of those convenient side of the road breaks when I rationalized the urge to play with the On-Star system by deciding it was time for a test.  We were off road and so far from a metropolitan area that I didn't even get a roaming signal on my cell phone.  On-star worked beautifully.  On-Star support came in loud and clear, reasonable confirmed my position (since I was � mile off the road) and provided an accurate estimate of how far I was from San Angelo.  I am not easy to impress, but� [get the picture]

The handling is good.  The turning ratio is great and the ride is better than expected even for a Cadillac truck.  It's big and heave enough to be safe and has enough pulling capacity for most uses.  Even though it looks like the board room, the Escalade has real off road 4wd capability.  The driving experience is pleasant and, compared to the mushy floating feel of the Navigator; the Escalade gives the driver a much better driving sensation.

Enough rambling, here are the items that could stand some improvement:  

Gas mileage and range was better than I expected but can easily go from 10 to 15 mpg depending on driving style.  It has a big engine so it's no surprise that when the foot goes down it can really guzzle gas.  However it has a large tank, 30 gallons, so the range is actually farther than a DeVille.  The dashboard has too much truck and not enough Cadillac features.  Gone are the digital trip miles, the instant miles per gallon, the automatic average miles per gallon, and, a real PITA [technical term] factor in cross country driving, the range to empty in miles is not to be found.  A real disappointment for seasoned Cadillac consumers.

Of particular irritation is the misplacement of the switches for the seat heaters.  Yes, the leather seats are heated - great news for cold winters, really bad news for hot summers.  The switches for both the front and back seats are easily bumped into the on position that really takes away from the appreciation of the splendid A/C, including the separate A/C controls in the back.  The good news is that the heaters do not go on unless the seatbelt is fastened so there is not a worry about unknown heating elements running.

Some people make a big deal out of a large vehicle only seating five.  Nevertheless, it seats five very comfortably with adequate additional cargo room.  The argument I have most often heard is that the third seat available in the navigator makes it so much roomier.  I am sorry to say that I have been in a rented Navigator that was supposed to transport a group in the junior high and high school age range.  The third seat is not for any but the fairly small occupant.  If having a lot of people transport room is your goal, stick to the large vans or Suburban sized vehicles.

In conclusion: I owned my Escalade for several months and put about 10,000 miles on it before writing this review.  I still love it and hope Cadillac will redesign the minor inconveniences out of the year 2000 model.  The ultimate compliment is that my wife is seriously considering an Escalade instead of her DeVille when it becomes time for her next vehicle.

Buy it.  Enjoy it.  I did/am.  If you want the best in an SUV borrow a line from the Sci-fi channel.  Just say &quot;Cadillac me!&quot;<br><br>
