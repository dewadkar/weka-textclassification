            The 1998 Monte Carlo takes a lot of slack from purists. From the reviews I've read, and enthusiasts I've heard this new vision of the muscle car lacks the performance of it's forefathers, and is nothing like it's Nascar counterpart. For the enthusiasts all I can say is an 85 Super Sport has comparable horsepower, and performance numbers, but this car is doing it on a smaller V6 engine, and front wheel drive. It may not be pulling the huge numbers of the old 70's machines, but then again what is? As for those saying it's no Nascar, I say Bravo to Chevy. If America wanted a gas guzzling, noisey, uncomfortable car held together with spot welds, electrical tape, and netting for windows I'm sure someone would make it. The fact is the Monte Carlo is a great car for those guys that need to compromise. You want a neck breaking speed demon, she wants something safe and practical, and good in the snow. With a Monte Carlo you'll feel like you won, she'll feel like you won, but she'll be happy. And everyone can enjoy speeding down the road in a great American car again.<br><br>
