                 As an experienced photographer, I decided it was time to enter the digital realm.  So many cameras to choose from...how many megapixels...what features...what reviews to trust ?  Seemingly complicated , but eased greatly by the purchase of the PDR-M4 !  A wonderful digital camera...crisp pictures ( especially in macro), easy to understand and use, and the downloading of pictures via USB has to be seen to be believed.  A sturdy product, nice metal casing which looks good and feels even better.  Came supplied with an 8MB SmartMedia card ( spend the bucks for a 32MB card,you'll thank me later.)  Also included were the cables ( USB, RS 232) and the CD for Image Expert ( I prefer Adobe products, however...so take note Toshiba ! )
     
Controls are well placed, easy to use, and the LCD monitor is nice and bright. ( although it will eat up the battery life if you're not careful.  Another very nice feature not found on other camera is the lighted panel on top of the camera which allows you to check out the time, battery strength, level of resolution, and number of shots.  The advantages and benefits here should be obvious, even to the most experienced users. 
    
I prefer to shoot at the highest resolution, hence getting a larger card is a must, as is an extra battery.  Printed out photos of my kids with an HP 697C and the pictures were very good!  As I get more experience with this fine camera I'm sure my photos will also improve.  One small downside, however, is the bit of difficulty in getting the USB connection to the camera loose post downloading.  Just take your time and exercise a little care. 

Also, the digital zoom is OK, but doesn't really fit into my plan of usage, so you might want to consider an optical zoom. ( PDR-M5 perhaps ?)  However, I must say that for the buck, this camera is, as my children like to say, &quot; The Bomb !&quot; The proof is in the pudding...check it out for yourself!!!!!      <br><br>
