            Why did I buy Subaru Impreza Wagon 2.0 RX? In April last year I had a opportunity to change my current car Nissan Almera to a new one. I had plenty of opportunities, but my choice was Subaru. Several features made this very easy for me 
- in Estonia we have a lot of snow during winter time and the All Wheel Drive is just perfect for these conditions.
- RX model looks quite nice and isn't too expensive
- last but not least, this car lasts! Even if you push it every day!

While driving you have maximum control over your car all the time. It doesn't depend whether you are driving on slippery road or in the countryside. The steering is just perfect and acceleration is wonderful.

I have heard from my friends that this car is just too noisy, but this sound fits with the car perfectly. Sometimes I even like to drive without turning radio on - just to hear the sound of the engine...<br><br>
