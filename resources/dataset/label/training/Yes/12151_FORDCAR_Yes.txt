            In the summer of 2000, I purchased a 2000 Ford F-250 Super-cab with the 4DR 4WD Off-Road package. It has the 7.4L Turbo-diesel engine, and leather seats, with all the accessories. Personally, i love it, for its driver/passenger space, its pulling trailer-pulling power, and the overall luxury and comfort of the interior. Considering the fact that its a pick-up truck, i believe it has some of the best comfort that i've ever experienced in a truck. The size of the truck is a little annoying, especially when pulling U-turns and parking, but hey, it is a full sized truck and i knew that so i doesnt matter. The gas mileage of the truck is fair for its engine size( 15 city/ 19 highway) or at least thats what i get. The acceleration of the truck is impressive, and its a rush to hear the turbo kick in when you slam on the gas. The handling isnt the greatest but i wasnt expecting that in a huge truck anyway. I would recommend this truck for a working man or woman if you like bigger sized trucks, or have horses or other &quot;toys&quot; to haul around. The safety of this truck is great considering when driving through the city and i get stopped at a red-light next to an 18-wheeler, i can almost look straight over at them. There are tons of modifications you can add on for more speed or power, but i feel that its already got enough of both. I truly enjoy this truck and strongly recommend it to people who want to spend a little money for a truck that will last a life time.<br><br>
