            I'm a purist, always have been.  Perhaps the result of being the son of a professional photographer.  So I've been waiting, and waiting, and waiting to plunge into the digital camera world for some time.  It'll be a while before any digital camera (that's reasonably affordable) will replace my Canon SLR, but I may have found a place in my world for digital. Why?  Because I can't take my Canon with me everywhere.  

For me, the 'right' digital camera is the one that I can take with me everywhere because its light and durable.  But the purist in me will not sacrifice photo quality to get these attributes.  And oh yes, I want adjustability so I can customize my shots.  In summary, I want it all.  I think I may have found what I've been looking for in this Casio.

For starters, its small - very small. about the size of a credit card and just under 1" thick.  BUT, the display is a whopping 2" big!  Try to find a display that big on any other small camera.  You won't!  Why is that important?  I didn't realize until I bought and started using the camera, but that screen becomes a photo album viewer more often than you think.  I (and those I share with) view photos from there more than on-screen.

OK, other signficant Pros - The picture quality APPEARS to be fantastic.  I say appears, because it looks terrific on screen, but I haven't printed any out yet, so I can't give you a complete assessment here.  That being said, there are many manual adjustments/overrides available for exposure and white balance, and you may need to use some of these to get exactly the results you want -- Some people might mind this, but as I said earlier, the purist in me prefers the adjustability.

The 'Best Picture' mode is kind of cool.  It allows you to pick from 15 or so different pre-set lighting/photo conditions(e.g., night portrait, night movement, B&W, scenery, candlelight) and automatically makes the necessary camera adjustments for you.  The 'purist' in me might prefer to make these adjustments myself, but I have to admit, the preset modes really do work well -- and, if  you come up with a special combination of settings on your own, you can add it to the presets.

The camera starts up almost instantly, and recycles very quickly.  I've never owned a DC before, but apparently this is an issue for some others.  The flash performs well at short distances, but virtually useless beyond 8-10 feet.

The camera has a lot of adjustability (exposure control, ISO, white balance, manual/auto focus, macro, etc.) but does not have aperture and shutter speed priority control  This may not matter to most, but the 'purists' will miss this, especially if you want to take an action photo and force a higher shutter speed.

The controls are very intuitive, and the on-screen interface is bold and clear (thanks again to the 2" screen).  Battery life is fantastic (compared to other cameras I've seen/used) and the battery only takes 2hrs to recharge.

The memory that is built into the camera (10MB) is woefully inadequate for all but the lowest resolution.  A 128MB or 256MB SD card is a MUST add-on.

As far as durability goes, I THINK this camera will hold up, but I already had to return it after 2 weeks when the 'down' toggle button failed.  Basically its a four-way rocker switch and I couldn't press the 'down' button without actuating the right or left buttons.  Its actually a relatively poor design and it wouldn't surprise me if the same button fails on the replacement that I got (I'll just keep my fingers crossed that it won't).  But the fact that I replaced it with the same camera knowing this, should tell you something.

In summary, I have had this camera just over a month and based on my experience thus far, I would highly recommend it-  I'm a difficult person to please, because I want EVERYTHING.  This camera doesn't deliver everything, but comes very close.  I'll be curious to see what others have to say.
