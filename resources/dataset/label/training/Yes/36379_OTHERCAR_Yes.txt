            Being a college student, money was running a little tight. I was driving a 95 Camaro and my gas budget was going through the roof. I sold my sports car and began looking for something more luxurious, but with better gas. I came across a 1994 Honda Accord EX. It was in excellent condition. It had all the extras, including tan leather interior. It was a 5 speed, so I was excited that I didn't have to give up all aspects of a sports car. When I test drove it, I was surprised at how well it handled. The engine was very quiet. The power under the hood was fair considering I just sold a 200 horsepower Camaro. All of the power options worked well except for the passenger side window which rolled down a little slower than the rest. I ended up buying the vehicle for a very good price. People tell me I am lucky for the price I got it at. The seller had just bought a new Jeep Grand Cherokee and hadn't paid off the Honda yet. They sold it to me for the payoff, which was right at $6,000. To this day, I love pulling into campus in a nice-looking, luxury car and knowing that my gas is only $10 per week!
