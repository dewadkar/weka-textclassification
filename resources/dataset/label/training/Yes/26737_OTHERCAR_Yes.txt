            I got my Olympus D360-L as a Christmas present.  Why it took me so long to write a review, I do not know.  This is my first Digital Camera  and  is pretty good considering the fact it was created about 3 years or so ago.  And my recent studies have shown me how greatly they have improved!  For now it does it's job just fine.  I do hope my photography will some day bring in some money.  Perhaps with a book about my garden or Home Famous recipes. But mine does it's job, with of course a few cons.

    It is light weight and has an attractive design.  The silver and black colors seem to still be in style, very much in style (plus it matches my top of the line HP printer).  Sliding open the front of it will allow you to take pictures, but not use the LCD screen.  To use it you must press the green button on the back.  It is a good feature to be able to choose whether or not to use the LCD screen.

     Christmas day I must have snapped more than 200 pictures(seriously).  The card provided holds from 2-122 pictures.  Depending on what quality you choose, you do get to pick from 5 of them. When I fill up the card I empty it onto my computer, then erase what was on it and start all over.  I assume this will eventually cause the card to take really bad pictures, but I will cross that bridge when  I  get to it.  It takes pretty good outside pictures in high natural light. But, it could be a bit more detailed.  When inside forget about it.  They become pretty grainy in low light even though you have the option of using flash.    It has tons of cool features, like the cool LCD screen.  You can choose how high quality you want your images.  How fast do you want it to take the picture.  Get rid of red eye.  Have it on a timer so you can run and be in it too.   I have a huge cactus in my backyard, about 2 stories high, but when ever I try to snap a shot of it, it looks fine in the screen, but comes out very dark, most of the time black.  I have yet to figure out how to adjust this problem.

     It does sort of have a zoom.  It is not the greatest but does get closer by 2x.  I just wish it was like a normal camera(35mm) so when you push a button it zooms way in and way out.   Another con is that it sucks up batteries like there's no tomorrow.  I would have to spend at least $20 dollars on AA's for a full days picture taking.  Too bad they did not supply the AC plug for it.  They wanted to give the battery companies the chance to make some more money.  If you do not use the LCD screen when taking pictures you will save probably hundreds of dollars a year in batteries!  Remember it does take 4 of them.

     But all in all it is a good camera, especially for the beginner!
