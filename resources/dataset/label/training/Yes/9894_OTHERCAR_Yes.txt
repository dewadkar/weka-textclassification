            I bought my 98 in Sept. of 97, as I literally could not find a 97 for the price I paid for this one.
I got the extended cab, so I can put little boys behind the seat.  It is good to be able to turn off airbags for little guys also.
My then 4 yr. old picked out the color, so I got a dark green.  I like the bed size is larger than other makes of small pickups.  
I bought it w/ 4 cylinder and 5 spd, because those came with a $1200.00 rebate.
For some reason tires do not last on the front of this thing.  I seldom get over 15000 miles out of a front tire, and I have had the front end alignment checked and rechecked.  I bought some 80,000 mi. guaranteed tires, and now just take it in and get them swapped every now and again.  I have probably put 10 tires on this thing in 40,000 mi.
I have had several problems with this thing from day one.
I had it towed back to the dealer a couple of times, when it wouldn't attempt to start.  That turned out to be caused by the $695 "antitheft device" dealer had installed, that I refused to pay for.  It seems those are so cheap, that dealer just left it in.  It wasn't worth taking back out.
A/C went out under warrantee.  Head gasket went out after the Dealership replaced the cylinder head that they stripped out changing my exhaust studs on a service bulletin under warrantee.  Electric cooling fan went out last fri. and dealer has none, but could get one by the following mon.  I found one on internet, and had it installed by 10:30 sat. morning.
The interior is comfortable and has held up well, and this is the only vehicle I have ever owned that let me slide my seat back farther that I want.
