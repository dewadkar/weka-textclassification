            I got a deal when I bought this car. When you first see this car your mind gets blown away by it's elegant style.  This car to this day is still used in many countries by kings and dictators. I look forward to driving this car every time I wake up or need to go somewhere because it is an experience I enjoy. Many may think that a car that is almost 13 years old won't get them excited, but Mercedes-Benz has always been ahead of their time.  Mercedes-Benz uses timeless design for their interiors. This means that your car isn't really dated and this pleases many people because you don't want to have to by a new car every 3 to 4 years.  So it has many of the same features that Cadillac, Lexus, Lincoln, and Acura now have in their vehicles. When I get into the large S-class I can immediately feel how well built the car really is. The sound system is a joy to listen to and the seats are some of the most comfortable you'll find even in todayï¿½s market. It handles extremely well and can still put the brand new cars in the market in second place. This cars in-line 6 cylinder engine has an good acceleration, but it true power gets unleashed on the highway. These cars are designed to go their maximum speed(about 135 mph) for 6 hours straight without stopping. Except  the United States highway system does have a speed limit so it is very unlikely that you will ever be able to use all the potential power. This car wasn't effected by the coastal air in Imperial Beach or the extreme heat sometimes experienced in Chula Vista(South Bay San Diego). So it's good till the engine goes out, even then you can replace the engine and keep on going.
