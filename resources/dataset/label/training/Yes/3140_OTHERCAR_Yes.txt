                I bought two Elantras six months ago.  Where else but Hyundai can you buy a car for 12,000 dollars?  Or two for 24,000 dollars?  And this car is fully equipped.  It has power windows and lock, keyless entry, cruise control, automatic transmission, AC, multiple settings on the intermittant wipers, alarm system, etc.  It has a lot of little features that I also enjoy.  Change pocket on dashboard,  sunglasses holder, cupholders front and rear, lighted ignition switch so you can see where to put your key, rear speakers, side airbags, etc.  All this is standard in the Elantra.  

     The car rides well.  I have owned Mazda's Protege, Honda's Civic, and Toyota's Corolla.  All these compact cars ride the same.  The Elantra just gives you a lot more for a lot less money.  There's plenty of room in the back seat. 

     Hyundai has the best warranty in the industry.  Five years and 60,000 miles bumper to bumper.  Ten years and 100,000 miles powertrain. (transmission, engine and drive axles)  Five year roadside assistance.  (Take that AAA)  There are also warranties on the battery, tires, and protection for the paintjob and under the car too.

     The only drawback with the Hyundai is that the resale value is not as good as Honda or Toyota.  

     I am very pleased with my Hyundai Elantras. It is also a very nice looking car.
