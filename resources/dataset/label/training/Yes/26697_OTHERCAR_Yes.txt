            I have now owned my Olympus D-360L for almost 3 months, and the jury is in.  I now have the luxury of comparing this digital camera to some of the &quot;Big Boys&quot;  i.e. $500-$1000 cameras.  Mainly the Sony DSC-S70.  (If you are interested, I also wrote a review on this camera.) 
    
    First though, let me tell you about the Olympus D-360L.  I bought the camera with the intention of having fun with it.  There was definitely no problem with the fun aspect.  Immediately upon receiving the camera, I was off on a camping trip taking pictures right and left.  Keeping the pictures that I wanted to, and deleting the ones that I disliked.  There was no problem figuring out the camera, and the instruction book was great! 

    This was great, though I quickly came upon a road block.  The problem was that the camera came with only an 8 MB smartmedia card.  I like to take the pictures at the highest resolution (1280 X 960), and this didn't allow for enough pictures.  

    The next road block was that the camera quickly ran out of power.  I purchased the camera to have fun with it.  Having fun consequently consisted of using one of the greatest aspects of the digital camera industry! The LCD screen!  And boy does this use up the batteries quickly.  I think that the batteries lasted for half a day, and keep in mind that the camera was not on all day long.

    Luckily, the two large road blocks that I ran into did not ruin the experience.  Just a little fine tuning, and everything turned out fine.  First of all I had to buy a larger memory card.  So I bought a SanDisk 32 MB smartmedia memory card from Buy.Com for $54 ($40 cheaper than what one of the large electronic megastores offered the same card for!)  Now with this 32 MB card my camera can hold 73 pictures at the highest resolution.  I do have to warn you that the panoramic photo option will not work with the SanDisk smartmedia cards.

    Next I purchased two sets of Nickel Metal Hydride batteries and a charger for $32.  These batteries are great, they last longer and they can be charged up to 1000 times.  One thing to note though is that it takes 15 hours to charge the batteries.  

    I have read many reviews on this product and one negative that everyone writes about is the fact that serial cable is too slow on downloads.  Yes it is slow, but that is not a big deal to me.  It takes around 20 minutes to download all of my photos from a 32 MB memory card.  

    Another fun feature of the camera is the video out function.  It is really nice to see the photos on the television where everyone can sit around and watch.  

    So I really enjoy this camera, but how does it stack up with the Sony DSC-S70?  Well when photos are taken at the same resolution (1280 X 960), the pictures are nearly the same.  The Sony though seems a little better, and it should.  The Sony is definitely a better camera, but if you are looking for a camera to just have fun with, look no further than the Olympus D-360L.
