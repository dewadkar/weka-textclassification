            Horse Power, Horse Power, Horse Power!!  It doesn't really matter what the commercials say about the Dodge Durango's competition, when it comes to power, my Durango's &quot;Magnum&quot; 5.9L engine tells the story.
Before my Dodge I drove a Ford Explorer.  I don't put these two vehicles in the same class.
I have the convenience of the room which is great for kids, groceries, and my husbands fishing trips.  I have the power to get where I need to go, fast if need be.  I was very surprised at the manuverability of such a large 4X4, and the gas mileage aint bad either.
One of my favorite features is the mini computer that lets me know how much distance I have to go before empty, an invaluable tool for me.  Now if I could only find some way to not loose my car keys!<br><br>
