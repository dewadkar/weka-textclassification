            To put the Toyota Camry in perspective, it is interesting to imagine James T. Kirk and Spock from Star Trek beaming down to modern day Canada to buy a new car. Kirk would probable go out and buy a BMW, Jaguar or maybe even a Viper. Spock, on the other hand, would probably come home with a Camry. 
I chose to purchase the XLE V6 with the leather seats, traction control and dynamic stability package...in other words the loaded version. I have now lived with it for over 2 weeks and it certainly is one fine automobile. We recently had a snow storm in Ottawa and I took it to a vacant lot to test out the stability and traction control. I just could not put it into a skid. The car runs incredibly quiet and the acceleration is excellent. Handling is adequate although not as good as the Volvo S60 or Honda Accord. The leather seats are comfortable, although lumbar support is somewhat less than ideal. Climate control is excellent and, in 20 below weather, the defogger and interior heat worked quickly and flawlessly. Traction plowing through the snow was exceptionally good. Safety equipped is excellent with side and front airbags as well as side air curtains all of which I hope that I will never have to put to the test. In other words, the car does everything well. It is however not a cheap thrill. Fuel economy is not great and expect to spend several thousand dollars more than for an equivalently equipped Accord, Altima or Taurus. It is however significantly cheaper that the Lexus ES 300 which does not offer much more for the money. 
Is this then a vehicle to be recommended? That depends on what you�re looking for. If you�re looking for excitement� forget it. This car is built for comfort, predictability but not excitement. If on the other hand you�re looking for a solid performer that will get you where you want to go in safety and comfort, this is it. Personally, my plan is to keep it for about 4 years. By then, my wife�s Volvo will be ready for replacement. She can then have the Camry (she actually prefers it to the 99 Volvo V70) and I�ll be ready for my 3 series BMW.
