            you would think, that just because it looks awesome that it automatically means it is the same quality to ride in! well.. in this case, it is true. i recently took one of these for a test drive, and i would have to say, besides my friends ferarri, that this was one nice ride. it was really smooth on the highway, and it came equipped with one bumpin stero! of course i could never afford to buy it, cause yes.. it is pricy, it is still on my top ten list! well.. at least until the new one comes out next year or so!!<br><br>
