            Interested in buying a new full-sized pickup truck?  Then you've probably looked at the Ford F150, The Dodge Ram, and the Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra.  While many buyers will gravitate towards a certain brand based on past experience, I was a first-time truck buyer and have owned vehicles from many other manufacturers.  This allowed me to evaluate each truck on its merits.  I chose a 1999 GMC Sierra.  It has an extended cab, the engine is the 5.3 liter V8.  I opted for the &quot;Z71&quot; off-road suspension upgrade as well as nearly every other option available.  I've owned it since new year's eve, 1998.  It's been used for heavy towing, hauling WAY too much topsoil, commuting in heavy snow conditions, and navigating the maze of poorly maintained trails on my farm in the Shenandoah Valley.
Overall, it is a high quality truck.  Unfortunately, first-model-year vehicles always have more bugs than more established models.  This is important to consider if you are looking at a 2000 or later model.  Most of the problems I encountered will not be present in later model trucks.
The first impression of this truck is that it is BIG.  The rear seat is the largest in any full size pickup, excluding club-cab models.  The 99 model has only three doors, with the third door on the passenger side.  The newer models have four doors, a big improvement.  The interior is well laid out, with comfortable seats and plenty of headroom.  The engine is very powerful, able to cope with heavy traffic and tight merging situations.  An option on this truck is the &quot;AutoTrac&quot; four wheel drive system, which allows the driver to switch to 4 HI, 4 LO, or AUTO 4WD by pressing a button, even while moving.  The AUTO 4WD feature is what I feel sets this truck apart from its competitors.  It allows power to the rear wheels, and when it detects a loss of traction, it transfers a percentage of power to the front wheels.  With so much power available, it makes taking off-ramps or other curves at higher speeds much easier.  It also makes driving on days where you may encounter an occasional patch of ice much less stressful and dangerous.  In other trucks your only option is to engage 4WD (not a good idea on long highway jaunts) or just be really careful.
Overall,  the problems I encountered were minor and quickly fixed under warranty.  Service is inexpensive, and easily worth the small expense, since this truck will last even the most demanding driver well over 250,000 miles.<br><br>
