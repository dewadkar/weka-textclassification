            After test driving the Ford 150, Chevy Avalanche and Toyota Tundra, I decided to try out the all new RAM.  I was never really impressed with the older model. Here are some of my findings.

Interior: The Quad Cab and Standard Cabs have lots of room to fit the kids and dog and even a nifty flat "load floor" in the Quad Cab when you lift the rear seat. Driving down the road the engine and road noise could hardly be heard compared with the other trucks.

Exterior: The new styling of the Exterior is more aerodynamic (probably explains the quietness in the cab).  Also a much more bolder grill gives the new Ram a tough look.  Love the BIG 20" Wheels offered as a factory option

Ride & Handling:  The ride is smooth and steering is very responsive. The new 4.7L is powerful and quiet.
