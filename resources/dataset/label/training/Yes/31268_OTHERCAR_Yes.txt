            We owned a 1995 Grand Am SE about a year ago.  We absolutely loved the car but had to sell it because my husband wanted a 4X4.  It was very reliable, and never gave us any problems.  It started every winter and was also a great looking car.  We thought the gas mileage on it was great.  Ours was hunter green with charcoal black interior, which was beautiful.  I have recently been looking at the new Grand Ams because I remember how reliable our car was and how unreliable the 4X4 now is.  We often wish we never sold that car.  We did end up selling it to a friend though, so I do still get to ride in it once in a while.  She agrees that it is a great car, and she has had no problems with it since she purchased it from us.  I definitely recommend the Grand Am!<br><br>
