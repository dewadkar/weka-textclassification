            I received the s20 as a graduation gift from college.  It is my first digital camera, but I have worked a lot with conventional photography.

The most notable feature of the s20 is that it defies the current industry paradigm of choosing between size and quality.  It may not have the best quality out there (although 3.3 megapixels is phenomenal) but it is smaller than most point-and-shoot 35mm or even APS cameras.  This allows it to take pictures of astonishing quality, but be used as a daytrip go-anywhere camera.  This, in my opinion, is its greatest strength.

Even at medium quality with medium compression, it takes 1024x768 photos (44 to a 16mb flash card) of excellent quality.  In its highest quality mode, the pictures don't even come close to fitting on my 1600x1200 resolution computer screen.  Simply amazing.

It has several impressive features as well.  While you can put it in automatic mode where the camera chooses everything, I have always been most enamored of cameras that allow you to control the elements of the construction of the picture as well.  The Canon S20 does it all. 

-It supports rapid shooting (multi-frame), single frame shooting, and timer modes.  

-It has automatic, sunlight, and indoor color balancing modes (a feat conventional cameras can only achieve through different films and filters.)

-It has 4 flash modes: automatic, red-eye reduction, no-flash and force-flash (flash no matter what).

-It supports free zoom between 6.5 and 13mm and a macro mode for close up shots.

-Its rear display is bright and clear even in sunlight and can be turned on or off depending on how much battery life is a concern to you.

As far as construction goes, the entire housing of the camera is metal, giving you the feeling of a durable camera, but the whole package remains light and small enough to fit in your pocket.

In the 5 months I've owned mine, I have taken hundreds of pictures, and the camera has never failed to capture even the most difficult lighting conditions to  my satisfaction.  All in all, I would suggest this camera to anyone wanting to buy a digital camera provided it falls within your budget.  The $800 price-tag is quite hefty.<br><br>
