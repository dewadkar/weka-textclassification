            I bought this vehicle for all the same reasons every one else did.  The price was great, it is known for reliability, and my sister walked away from a horrible accident from behind the wheel of a carolla.  

So why do I have heartbreak?  I bought this car in the middle of February, right after the last of the snow melted.  3 days after my first oil change, 3 months into owning the car, I noticed paint was chipped off the car in many spots.  

I immediately took it back to the dealership where I was told, &quot;Maybe a special flock of birds flew over it.&quot;  I was basically laughed at.  I have been fighting with Toyota, an arbitration agency, and the dealership ever since.  

Toyota is denying all responsibility.  It is MY fault they say, however they won't say what I did to make it happen.  I suppose maybe my beef is with Toyota and not the carolla necessarily.  

I loved my toyota. I loved it with a passion, the reliability, the gas mileage, the look and the feel.  But that is now all tainted by the pain and heartbreak of an irresponsible manufacturer.
