            The 5th generation Chevy Corvette is the pinnacle of the Corvette line. It met all expectations of performance and exceeded my expectations of interior comfort. The 5.7-liter V-8 averages roughly 22 MPG (I have an automatic transmission) and has not had any problems in the year that I have owned it. 

The options I'd recommend are the heads-up display, 6-way adjustable seats, performance axle, dual-zone climate control, seat memory and active handling. Though I didn't get active handling, from other's descriptions, it is a good feature and can be very helpful in inclement weather conditions. 

The only problems I have noticed are that the seatbelt can become stuck if it is let go of too quickly, and that the hatchback tends to leak water into the trunk if you open it while it's wet. You also tend to get sprayed while going through the car wash, the windows don't seal as well those on other cars.
