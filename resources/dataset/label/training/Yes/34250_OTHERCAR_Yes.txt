            This review is from someone who actually owns one, and not from a test driver. We own and drive a 2004 Volvo XC90 T5 AWD with Climate and Versatility packages. People buy Volvos for safety, and Volvo has made some breakthroughs with this vehicle. I tell everyone I know, if you have the means, buy one today. I&#146ll touch on all aspects of the vehicle one by one:

EXTERIOR: I think this vehicle stands out with some great styling. Better than most Japanese models and Euro&#146s including the ML 350 and MDX. The BMW is more sporty, but not the target Volvo was aiming for. It is more of a conservative design with an elegant touch. We get many looks at stop lights.

INTERIOR: Texture of the dash could be a little better, the ML 350 has a better feel, but the layout and ergonomics are spectacular. A definite cross between a typical SUV and touring sedan. I have been on 2 trips and never fatigued. The seats hold and support. The memory seats are an added feature. The 2 stage moon roof keeps buffeting to a minimum at highway speed. Side curtain airbags add an extra layer of safety. There is not as much rear room as an Expedition, but I&#146ll suffer. It was not designed to travel with 7 people down the coast for a week. It is a great vehicle to take friends with kids or grandparents out to dinner or the theater. We keep the 2 rear seats down until needed, which gives more than enough room for storage; stroller, dog etc..  There is ample room behind the third row of seats for the stroller or dog on a short trip. These features were not available in the Explorer and Expedition in bigger vehicles.  The third row folds down with 2 easy steps and folds flat.

MECHANICS:  The 5 cylinder turbo moves the 90 sufficiently. The 6 cyl. Accelerates the 90 to 60 MPH in about .4 sec quicker than the 5 cyl.. Not worth the 8,000.00 difference.  The turbo does take a little getting used to, but the average Joe won&#146t even know. The power band is very broad, making 2 lane passing with a full load a breeze. Do not compare this motor to the FX 45 or BMW. These 2 vehicles are built for a different purpose and crowd. The average family does not need all the horsepower. The ride is firm, as most European models.  You will not expect a Lincoln or Caddy like ride from this vehicle. But on par with similar vehicles. 

CONCLUSION: As stated earlier, buy this vehicle. Couldn't imagine owning anything else. I almost bought an Explorer Limited for 38K and an Expedition for over 40K. Boy am I glad I didn't. This vehicle offers all the little things and the major thing of safety. The boron ROPS and side curtain airbags that remain inflated in a rollover are reason enough to put your family in. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
