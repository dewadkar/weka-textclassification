            I needed a new camera and have heard so much about the digital cameras but after looking in the ads decided I may as well go with a regular 35 mm camera.  The prices were way out of my budget.  

Then I received a message about the Relisys 3500 Digital Camera.  Through xoom.com I was able to buy this camera for $96.00 plus shipping and handling.  It came within a week and I have been very pleased with it.

I have been told that some of the Digital Cameras of the past had to be hooked up to your computer to even take a picture.  The Relisys 3500 gives you the ability to take it with you anywhere. 

It does look very cheap.  I was impressed with the outcome.  You can only take about 15 pictures for the memory to hold.  You do have the option of buying additional memory.

The software was very easy to install.  I am happy with this camera.  I am sure eventually I will get the additional memory so if we go on vacation I will be able to store more on it.  But, for birthdays and holidays this works great!<br><br>
