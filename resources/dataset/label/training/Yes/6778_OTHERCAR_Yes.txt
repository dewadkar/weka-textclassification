            The Plymouth Breeze is an excellent student or second car for someone who is not looking to spend a lot of money for a car. I drove the car for 5 years and I felt like I got my money's worth off the car. It was my first "new car." 

The Breeze is great on gas, roomy on the inside, and drives more sporty then most large cars in the same size category. The seats are comfortable and the layout of the dash is easy to get used to.

While the Breeze has it's high points it also has some low ones. The car seems to need brake replacement very often, almost every 5,000 miles. The car sometimes lacks power because it is so big and heavy, making it worse when it is loaded with passengers. The weakest link on the car may be the transmission. It has been replaced twice.

The transmission had to be replaced under warranty the first 3,000 miles for some reason then again at 100,000 miles. That is the only major repair that has been made on the car. In spite of the repair I think the Breeze is still a good car. My wife drives it today with close to 150,000 miles on it.


Overall I have enjoyed the Breeze. It has run well most of the time I have had it. The Breeze is also very safe. During the first year I had it a huge van ran into my front passenger fender. My fender took the full impact and I did not feel a thing, not even feel a jolt. The car was fully repaired and been working great ever since.
