            In January of 1999, my wife and I were expecting our second child and we had a 2 door Saturn.  We knew that we needed a family car, so we went back to the dealer that we originally purchased the Saturn from.  We were looking for a fair sized car with four doors.  We looked at a Toyota Camry, Ford Contour, Dodge Neon and <b>Chevy Lumina</b>.  

The Camry was great, but a little too pricey.  The Contour and the Neon were just not big enough and they did not drive too well.  Then we came to the <b>Chevy Lumina</b>.  I was a little hesitant about any GM product after all the stories I have heard and my encounters with them.  But then we test drove a Chevy Lumina LS and was very impressed.  I did not need all the options that came with the LS, so we settled on a 1996 base model Lumina with standard 3.1 engine, A/C, PW, PL, dual airbags, and security system. 

The price was very reasonable for such a great car.  The price on the sticker was $9500, but after haggling with the salesman, we talked them down to $8900.  The car had 40,000 miles on the odometer and was in perfect shape.  Still we thought we should purchase the extended warranty because looks can be deceiving. 

But one year and 30,000 miles later, I still think that I got a great deal.  I have not had any major mechanical problem what so ever.  Sure, I change the oil after every 3,000 miles, but that is the only maintenance that my <b>Chevy Lumina</b> has received or required.  

The 3.1-liter engine has power like it is bigger than it really is.  What I mean by this is this car will scoot for the size car that it is.  It has fooled a great deal of my friends in the way it accelerates from take off.    It cruises down the highway without even a slight whimper.  Gas mileage is great for a car this size with 28 MPG on average.

There is one minor glitch with the brakes.  I have had the brake pads changed but they still squeak to no avail.  Other than that small irritation, the brakes are first-rate for a base model car. I know there have been plenty of times where I have had to hit them hard, but I always have gotten stopped in a sufficient amount of time without brake fade or lock up. 

The interior of the <b>Chevy Lumina</b> is pretty well laid out.  All the control and buttons are within easy reach of the driver.  The seats are very comfy with an ample amount of leg room in the front and back even with the front seats pushed all the way back.  Tall people would not even gripe having to ride in the back in this roomy car.

The car handles pretty well for a family car.  When I first purchased this car, I pushed it through some curves just to see how much it would take.  Honestly, I was surprised at how well it went into the curves and handled them so well.  The GM people have definitely done their homework on this car.

I would highly recommend the <b>Chevy Lumina</b> to any family with children that need the extra room and comfort of more expensive models but without going bankrupt.  Believe me, I got a great deal on this car and was well worth the money I bought it for and then some!  

Just remember that we purchased a base model Lumina, not a LS or LTZ.  If our base model handles this great, can you imagine how well the more expensive Lumina models do?  <br><br>
