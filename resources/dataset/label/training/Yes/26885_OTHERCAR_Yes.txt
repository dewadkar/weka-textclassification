            I bought my 2000 QC in May 2000. 

I compared it to a Ford Super Crew. The day I test drove there were very high crosswinds on the highway. The Ford (a 4-wheel drive) was pushed all over the lane. The Dodge however, was rock steady. This turns out to be one of the best vehicles I've ever driven for handling in high winds.
(I admit I was comparing 2 to 4-wheel drive, but the Ford dealer didn't seem to think anyone wouldn't want the extra expense and maintenance of 4-wheel drive)

After a year of driving this truck, I am still impressed with the handling. I use it on the highway mostly, and it has ample power, reasonable braking, and a great ride.

The four doors are a big plus. I haven't had anyone complain about back seat comfort. In fact the back seats are more comfortable that the larger Ford.

I have the 4.7L mated to a 5-speed. The transmission is great when hauling loads or trailers, but for normal driving, the difference in 1st and second gear gear ratios makes it difficult to shift smoothly. No one would ever mistake this for a sport car transmission. Long throws and slushy gates makes it my least favourite part of the truck. That said, try the five speed before buying an automatic. What a difference in the character of the truck. (Update Jan-04: The transmission was replaced at 60K miles under warranty. Judging by the difference in feel, the original was a problem from the day they delivered the truck. No more slushy gates, and no more episodes where I can't get it into a gear no matter how hard I tried)

Finally, gas mileage is not impressive. If you can't afford to support the oil companies, you may want to look for a compact pickup. (Update Jan-04: Average mileage over 4 years is 15L/100km - 18.5mpg Imperial - 15.5mpg US. Compared to what I've seen posted for real world mileages of SUVs using smaller engines, this isn't bad. I switched to platinum plugs to increase the time between plug changes because worn plugs gave me some of my worst mileages.)
