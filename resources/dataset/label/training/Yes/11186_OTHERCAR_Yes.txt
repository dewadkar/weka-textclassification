            Overall, I was pleased with the DX3700.  It was less expensive than comparable cameras, easy to use and a huge improvement over the digital camera it replaced.

The first big appeal, as you can tell by my title, was the price.  At about $270, there were no other cameras I could find with 3.1 megapixels.  Cameras in the 3.1 range were at least $100 more than this model.

Second, and this may not help any of you, was that it used the same memory card (MMC/SD) as my old digital camera.  With the 32MB card the camera takes around 32 pictures, more than I ever will take at one event.  Removing the card allows for taking 8 more pictures using the camera's internal 8MB memory.

I also like the ability to preview the photos I have taken, allowing me to delete unwanted photos and freeing up memory.  

Another feature that appeals to me is that the camera takes 2 AA batteries.  I have had this recurring problem with not being able to get replacement batteries for electronic equipment.

The optional date stamp on the photos is a feature I leave on.  I can never remember when a picture was taken and it makes looking at older photos more enjoyable, if one knows when the picture was taken.

I am certain that some of the negative issues I had were due to my inexperience.  I point them out primarily to ensure that any one else who purchases the camera is aware in advance.

Pay special attention to the wording "3x Digital Zoom" which appears on the packaging.  The camera provides an illusion of zoom by displaying a smaller portion of the view at a lower resolution.  This effect can be duplicated by not using the zoom, then clipping and blowing up a portion of a photo on your computer.

The camera cradle is a bit expensive at $79 (that is how much the one I found costs).  The only advantage I could see was that it is used to recharge the battery that comes with the camera.  I'll just buy the batteries.

My last issue with this camera is that there seems to be a delay in taking the picture.  When I press the shutter button and hear the click, I expect to see the flash, but the flash is delayed for a second.  This may be standard for digital cameras, but I am still used to the behavior of 35mm and miss the instant gratification.
