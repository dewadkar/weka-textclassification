            SUMMARY ***********************************
More fun that you�d think for a decent price. 

I LIKE ************************************
I had a �95 Neon Highline for a couple of years. I had the 5 speed transmission which made a huge difference to the �fun factor� on this car. I liked driving it and it cruised OK on the highway (I was driving between Vancouver and Seattle regularly so I did a LOT of highway miles). It got decent gas mileage. I also drove it in Northern Canada and it handled well on the snow and ice.

I HATE ************************************
It wouldn�t be a good car for a freeway commute in traffic. I drove a rental with an automatic transmission and didn�t like it nearly as much as the standard. Resale value was a lot less than I had hoped (and I bought it used...)

WOULD I BUY ANOTHER ONE? ******************
It doesn�t suit my current needs. I�m in traffic a lot right now so I need an automatic and so want a larger engine. This is a good fun city car if you don�t sit in traffic a lot.
