            One of the first things I noticed about this truck was the overall closed-in nature of the back half. It was open enough to allow inside passengers to see out and not be feel boxed in, but makes the truck seem solid enough for regular day-to-day driving. My original purpose behind buying a so-called &quot;mini-SUV&quot; was for its interior size. Being 6'4&quot; tall doesn't do well for a person when they're shopping amongst the new cars, looking for one that fits. :)

Chevrolet did a good job on this Blazer, especially by mounting controls within easy reach of the driver, yet still letting the front passenger have access when needed. Touches such as the ability to override the automatic Daytime Running Lights (DRL) complete the air of control that the driver has over the vehicle. The pedals may be placed too far back for some people, but the optional 6-way power driver's seat makes it easy to adjust to whatever personal body style you may have. I personally find that all the way back and down is the ideal driving position.

This Blazer also has plenty of room for storage, which is amazing considering it is the 2-door model, LS-sized at that. There are two storage compartments between the front and back seats, situated forward from the wheel-well. The back cargo area is also quite roomy for its size, and the overhead console in the front makes convenient places to put important papers and the all-needed compact discs. The center console is quite useful, with its area to store 5 CDs or whatever else you need, along with the flip-up storage area on the arm rest (with removable tray to put stuff in below). If the cargo area doesn't suit your fancy, the back seat is a 50-50 fold down, meaning either or both halves of the seat can be laid out flat to hold more items. (It's also quite good for catching a quick nap :) ).

Driving is fairly good in this vehicle, though the suspension is a lot more what one would expect from a light truck than a car, meaning it rides slightly rougher than people will expect. The Vortec V6 has a lot of power behind it, making this &quot;small&quot; (comparatively) package quite useful where acceleration or towing capability is needed.

On the downsides, this is definitely an SUV, meaning that gas mileage (16 city/22 highway) is lower than most newer vehicles on the road today.  Owing to the fact that it is a two-door vehicle, the back seat is difficult for those without good to very good mobility to get inside (i.e. your 80-year-old grandmother probably will ride up front), and if you have a power seat, there is no automatic release to slide the seat forward for back access. And, as always, there are the niggling details, like the support beam for the back end blocking right where the driver expects to look over his shoulder.

Overall, this is an excellent vehicle, in my opinion. If you don't like SUVs or 2-door vehicles, this Blazer is certainly not for you. Also, if you are on a very tight budget for gasoline, I'd consider looking elsewhere. But, if you're a larger person who needs or wants a vehicle that you're almost certain to fit in comfortably, and has a lot more space and creature comforts than its size would indicate, I'd give this one a look.<br><br>
