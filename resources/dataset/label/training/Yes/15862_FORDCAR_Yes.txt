            After owning a Ford pickup for eight years, my husband, Dan, wrecked it.  We were now faced with what do we do now.

After our insurance settled with us, we started looking.  I believe we looked everyday for a week.  I was six months pregnant with our second child.  I wasn't very happy with our search.  He was looking for the older style, not the new. Finally he came out of a dealership telling me he had found it.  

My only two request for the truck was that it had to be an automatic and be an extended cab.  Dan purchased this vehicle without seeing it. It was red with grey interior.  We fell in love instantly. The best part was we even got air-conditioning with it. 
 
This vehicle is now three years old.  We have taken many trips in it.  Our family has grow to three children now. They all fit comfortably in the back seat.  They are able to get in and out of it well.  The front seats have a lot of room.  

I would recommend this truck to anyone with a family.<br><br>
