            <b>My Camaro</b>
A few years back, I had the joy of owning a 25th anniversary edition 92 Camaro RS, teal in color.  I really enjoyed that car.  There are cars out there that are faster, handle better, and with a higher build quality, but there was something about this car, perhaps the lack of perfection creating somewhat of a &quot;personality&quot; within it, or the way the controls seemed to be placed right for me that made me really like it.  

My particular car came equipped with a 305 (5 liter) V8 engine with throttle body injection, and a 4-speed automatic.  It had power windows, locks, rear hatch, air conditioning, cruise, and T-tops.  I liked the look of the 16 inch factory aluminum wheels.  It had decent power, felt comfortable to me when cruising down the highway, and actually got decent gas mileage.  Here's the kicker: on road trips I would occasionally bump 30 mpg with it, with a big V8.

I've owned other Chevies in the past, and if taken care of, they'll hold up well.  Parts are cheap and plentiful, used or new.  They're very easy to work on.  If you want a car that performs well without spending a lot of money, and something that you can modify relatively cheaply, this is it.  The 3rd generation Camaros (82-92) were capable of very good handling, and the Chevrolet V8 can be massaged to put out some serious power if needed.  T-tops can rattle and leak after they get a few years behind them, so keep that in consideration.  They did build these cars in a convertible version too, if you want to have some of that fun in the sun cruising.<br><br>
