            A year ago I needed (wanted) a 4WD vehicle to tow my 5,000lb boat and my wife wanted a SUV to ferry the kids, dogs and friends around. After looking first at the towing capabilities we narrowed our search down to the Dodge Durango vs the Ford Expedition.  Then came the three C's comparison (cost, comfort, coolness factors). For us the Dodge provided a lower drive away cost and its coolness factor won out over comfort. I still have people stop me at mall and shopping parking lots to ask if they can see it and ask my opinion about the Durango.

But who am I kidding. Its only the kids that are uncomfortable. Especially the ones that have to endure riding in the third row jump seat. Kids though, love the riding in a cool car so they could care less about personal comfort. 

Okay, enough about how it looks and how cool the Durango is. What you really want to know is what's really wrong with the truck?  First, its a truck. If you love trucks then there is nothing wrong. If you love Lexus' or other high end SUVs then we would probably disagree about this epinion anyway so you can quit reading here and not waste you time, unless you have an open mind. Then you might like to know that after one year and 23,000 miles coast to coast and over hills and dales and every where in between I have not had one mechanical engine or drive train related problem!!!

I have had two small problems. 1) The driver electrical seat adjustments quit the morning after I got home from the dealer. The dealer thought that it would be a simple switch or motor replacement. And he was right, only the motor and the switch are integrated into the seat so the whole seat was replaced. 2) the factory installed running boards look great. However they bow in and have become warped. After two sets and the third also warped I haven't had time to hassle with the dealership to replace them again. Quality control with the vendor supplied parts.  My suggestion Dodge if you're listening... Get a new vendor for the running boards.

Towing capability - Great! no problems and with the 5.9L engine I can move at highway speeds without fear of either holding up traffic or not having enough power to pass other boaters hauling their dream machines with too small tow vehicle.

Things I really like about the Durango are the front seats. They are very comfy. I like the dual 12V DC sockets in the front and the extra one in the cargo area. I like the little trunk space in the Cargo area. Lots of drink holders for passengers. I really like stereo system with the driver touch controls on the steering wheel. Great Idea! Rear passenger windows that come down all the way.

What could be improved: Reclining seats for rear passengers. A door lock/open button in the cargo area. The Vans have it so why not the Durango?
