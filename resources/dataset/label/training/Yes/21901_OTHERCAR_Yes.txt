            This is our 2nd BMW.....first was a 325i. The 528i is absolutely one of the finest vehicles on the road. Sure there is the 54o and also the M5 (one of these days!), however for the price in the low 40's you get an excellent vehicle.

The ride, drive, comfort and workmanship are flawless, not to mention the ulitmate driving experience. The car is quick and agile. Would highly recommend the Sports Premium package....definitely makes the car more sporty.

If and I do mean if I was forced to find fault, it would be the less than powerful sound system (my QX4 actually has a better system) and the cupholders are definitely not designed for any beverage whatsoever.

These two small items aside I HIGHLY recommend the 528i!!!<br><br>
