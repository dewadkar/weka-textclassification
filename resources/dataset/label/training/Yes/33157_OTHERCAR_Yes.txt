            I bought this vehicle because it looks great and it was affordable.  Actually, we are a two Malibu family.  I bought the 1998 model and liked it so much that I bought another one.  I compared it to other GM vehicles in the same class, but found that the Malibu handled the best.  The list of options is extensive, but I settled for the V-6 Engine, Air Conditioning, Anti-Lock Brakes, Cruise Control, 6 Speaker CD-Stereo System, Power Windows, Power Locks, 6-way power driver's seat, Keyless Entry, Rear Defroster, and a Built-in Security System.  The seats are very comfortable, which helps a lot on long trips.  The only thing I hate is not being able to go over 75 mph on the open road, because you can feel that that there's still plenty of power left.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is in the market for a family sedan with great looks and a modest price tag.
