            The Canon A20 is an excellent budget camera providing ease of use with enough manual settings to satisfy most amateur photographers.
Photo quality is excellent and adjustable down to sizes that are suitable for direct transfer to webpages via the easy to use USB cable conection to your PC.
Daylight photography is where the Cannon A20 shines with true colour rendition and clear bright shots.
Unfortunately low light shots suffer from a too low powered flash and a red eye reduction system that doesn't work very well. This can be overcome to some extent in situations where even with low light, the Canon is able to adjust its exposure to offer good picture quality with the flash turned off.

Battery life is extremely limited using Alkaline batteries so the purchase of two sets of NiMH rechargables is a good move so 4 can be used and the others kept as backups.
The NiMH last much longer than alkaline or NiCad.

I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a quick easy to use camera with a few tricks up its sleeve.
