               If you're looking for true luxury in an SUV, Lexus is by far the best choice. This is actually the third SUV I've bought. I have a '99 Mercedes M-class and I just got rid of my '95 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Out of these three, I would pick the Lexus any day. The front seats are extremely comfortable. The back seats are not as comfortable but better than the Benz and the Jeep. When I sit in the seat of this car, I feel like I can just drive for hours. The LCD screen is nice, and the sound system is great. The interior is just beautiful. Overall this is the best buy that I've ever made.

The M-class is much louder than the Lexus but offers much more engine power. The Lexus is more of an easy and smooth acceleration. The M-class, on the other hand, can really roar and take off if you want it to (great acceleration). The Benz offers more power with nice acceleration, while the RX is more of a luxurious and smooth and doesn't really brag of a quick acceleration time (it feels much more like a car than the M-class). They just feel totally different. 

The only other draw back of the RX is that it has less trunk room than the M-class and the Jeep. You can probably fit two - three large suit cases in the RX pretty comfortably. However in the M-class, you can fit in about four - five. The wider body of the M-class also offers three full seats in the rear, while the RX only has two and a half.

However, the smaller body of the RX makes it much easier to park and see where you are going. Also, the RX looks much better than the Benz.

An important thing that distinguishes Lexus from Mercedes is the service. When you talk to the people at Lexus, they are so pleasant to talk to and really make sure that you are truly satisfied. Mercedes, although not terrible, comes no where close to the service of Lexus. Although many people may not pay attention to service, I think it is really important. When I call the Lexus dealer, it is always a pleasant conversation. Mercedes, not always so.

Sorry to make this so long, I just wanted to share as much as I could with any possible buyers. I really hope this helps someone make a decision when they buy. Overall, both the M-class and the RX are very reliable SUV's and are excellent brand names. However, the comfort and luxury of Lexus beats Mercedes any day. Just to make this point clear. I bought a new M-class in the end of '99. Then I bought a Lexus (ES), the end of 2000. When I went back this year, Lexus was unquestionably the choice, and I bought an RX. The point is if you want power and room, go for the M-class, if you want real luxury and can deal with a little less room, go for the Lexus. I used to be a power maniac, but the feeling of driving a Lexus has really changed my tastes. Good Luck and hope this was helpful.
