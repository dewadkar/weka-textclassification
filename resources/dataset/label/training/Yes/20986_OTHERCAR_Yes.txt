            I came upon my 1997 Dodge 1500 Ram in November 1999.
Passing by a local Chrysler dealers lot, what caught
my attention was the RARE color of dark chocolate brown 
and silver two-tone.  I knew these to be few &amp; far between
from my research and knowledge of the product.  I stopped
to take a closer look and was pleasantly surprised to see
the super low mileage of only 12,000 miles!  The truck was
virtually like new in every respect upon further inspection.
After a short test drive, I was completely sold.  We have had
Dodge Ram trucks in our family in the past and this would be
my first experience with a 1997 model year.  After one year
together, I can honestly tell you its been a great relationship!
The Ram has never been down for any mechanical failure.  It
has been trustworthy, easy to handle, and has a comfortable ride.
