            I bought this camera for 65 bucks, kept it for a week, and returned it. My reason, it can't take pictures indoors under normal lighting conditions. This camera is great as a secondary camera.  You can just stick it in your pocket and take it around everywhere. Although it's plastic, its pretty durable.  The shots are amazingly crisp, provided your are under a lot of light.  Indoors it seems to only work under florescent lighting, that means shots will turn up great at public places like schools and the mall.  Outdoors, as longs it's a sunny day you should have no problem.  Forget about using it around your house, directional lighting will just not cut it.  The camera offers two quality settings, High (1248 x 960), and Low (640 x 480). The memory holds up to 50 high quality, and 160 low.  This camera also takes pretty sweet video clips, of 30 seconds of high quality, about 120 seconds of medium quality.  Both 10 frames per second, so the video turns out okay, but kind of wavy.  Because of the size of the camera, it turns out to be a pretty sweet feature.  Other great things are the 10 second selftimer, the easy to use USB interface, the provided software, and a pretty decent battery life (1 week, 2 AA).  The one thing you can forget about though is using this as a webcam.  The mega lighting it requires pretty much renders that feature useless.  The camera is pretty easy to use, you can catch on to it all after a few uses. There is a tiny display in which you run through icons pressing one single button, till you get what you need.  You can delete pictures as you take them, but there is no way to view them beforehand.  Shots takin while moving will appear really blurry.  

The size of the camera really is the best part.  I loved the fact that I could just slide it in my pocket, and pull it out whenever I wanted.  To get a real feel of how tiny it is, check out the aiptek site(http://www.aiptek.com/products/digital/mini.htm).

I would seriously buy this camera again, just after I spend my money on a real nice, although bigger, digicam.
