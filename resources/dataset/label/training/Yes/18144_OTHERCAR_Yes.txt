            Not only is the styling foxy, but the '94 Nissan Quest handles the road well and has the power to glide up Southern California's Grapevine pass in cruise-control mode without hesitation. The interior needs a bit more stowage and the rear windows are not easy to latch and unlatch, but overall we're please with the comfortable ride and well-engineered visibility. 

We bought this one with 110,000 miles on it, but it was in top condition and well-maintained by the previous owners. I notice a small amount of transmission whine, but nothing that indicates a problem. Other Ford-made vans I tested had similar, but louder transmission noise and reports of problems in older models, so we're watching closely. 

We took the keys from the dealer and loaded our Quest up for a trip up to Northern California. The ease of handling the winding coast roads and smooth, relatively quiet ride made the family trip a grand experience, especially combined with the California scenery in springtime! The only complaint we had during the trip was the smell that you get when shutting off the AC after running it awhile. I would venture to guess that condensation is building up in the system and the water build-up creates an odor when just the fan/vent is run. Running with the vent only for a while eventually eliminates the odor. 

Overall, we're pleased with the performance and the gas mileage is about average for a vehicle of this type and size.<br><br>
