            In the four years (and 50k miles) that I've had this car, it hasn't had to be serviced yet. 

I have a '96 Cavalier LS. Got it because I wanted economy, but also wanted ABS, auto, four doors, folding rear seat, and air. Got it all for (at the time) about $12k. Even a Hyundai Accent, when loaded with those options, was more expensive, but much smaller.

I've had regular oil changes and maintenance. I have a small oil leak that should be remedied this weekend when I tighten the head. I've changed the brakes once, which was easy as pie. There's a very intermittent rattle in the exhaust that's been there for years...it's so infrequent that I haven't bothered to deal with the clamp. There's an annoying little ripple at the bottom corners of the windshield...my mom's Lumina has the same thing.

It's not a HEAVY car. It's not an armored tank. It's not hugely spacious. But if you're not a particularly large person (I'm 5'8&quot; and have plenty of room), you'll find that it's comfortable, VERY economical way to get the options you want.<br><br>
