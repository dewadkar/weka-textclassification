            Having just sold my Olympus 340R to a buddy (worked great) and also my classic Linhof 4x5, I read a couple of reviews on the Elph. Plastic card in hand I headed for the nearest store. Five minutes later I am hooked, there is nothing else like this in the camera world. Having had digital before you know the standard 8mb CF is a joke. Bought a 32mb CF card, (good for 180 medium quality pix).

Having had this jewel for over a month now I am even more impressed. Try the photo-stitch software, do a few panoramas, it's like the IMAX image of the camera world. No problems with battery life for me so far. Do yourself a favor, pick up a Zio! CF card reader for $30. It's a USB reader for the flash card, plug it in, voila! your images are downloaded using NO camera battery power. Beats spending $60 for the AC adaptor.

Summary: This camera is beautiful and does everything well. It is built to last, you will forget that it's a little expensive after looking at your first panorama, and getting those admiring glances from camera afficianados.
