            I always research a car before I make a purchase.  Before I bought my  RAV 4 I owned a Toyota Camry and put 200,000 mile on it.  My Toyota experience as with my three Honda experiences were excellent.  I bought the Rav 4 because I loved the way the hatch opened, the size of the SUV and the style (rounded) as opposed to squared off like the CRV.  My RAV is 4 years old and I have 70,000 miles on it.  The ONLY complaint I have is I recently backed into a 1986 Cadillac and I was going maybe 5 miles an hour and The damage to my car was just under $2500.00.  The entire back door needed to be replaced.  What if I had been in a bad accident?
The car is not as smooth as other cars.  It feels like a Corolla whilst driving it, but it serves my needs.  I added a sun-roof and security system.  To date, I have not seen another SUV that is affordable that i would like better.  I would highly recommend it!
