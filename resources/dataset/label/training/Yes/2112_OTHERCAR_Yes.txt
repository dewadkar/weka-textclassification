              With all the great trucks available today, there are a lot of great choices to wade through.  I personally like American made trucks so that limits my choices.  I already owned a Dodge and wanted something different.  I finally decided on the 2001 GMC Sierra 1500 SLE.  

  The first thing that caught my eye about this truck was that it is a real head turner.  The truck looks great already. Add tinted windows, custom chrome tipped Flowmaster exhaust, chrome step bars, chrome aluminum wheels, AND lower it 2 inches...talk about bad to the bone!  All of the aftermarket modifications were performed by the dealership.  The truck I purchased also has the stepside bed which adds even more the the styling.  I have gotten many compliments on the truck in the few months I have owned it.  It just begs to be driven.  

  The interior of the truck is very well laid out.  Instrument panel is very well lit and easily visible to all gauges thru the steering wheel.  Climate and stereo controls and placed well within driver reach.  The SLE comes with 6 speaker CD that sounds excellent.  Seats are very comfortable and offer great lumber and head support.  The seats are divided 40/20/40, with a decently sized center console.  Dual air bags are standard.  Visibility is above average around the thick window columns.  Two things I dislike about the interior are the cup holder and behind the seat storage.  Both of these areas could have taken notes from Dodge.  The cup holder is placed directly below the middle seat where the center console rests.  Not only is it difficult to get drinks from the cup holder with the console down, forget about putting a drink in the holder if three people are riding.  Behind the seat storage could have made use of the shelf system used in Dodge trucks.  There is plenty of room for this feature and I hope they add this in future editions.  

  Performance and handling are excellent in the SLE edition.  My truck has the 4.8 Liter, 270 hp V8 as standard equipment.  The engine is very torque heavy and has lots of low end torque.  Routine maintenance such as spark plug replacement, oil and air filter changes are easily accessible and could be performed by the average do-it yourselfer.  I drive quite a bit on the highway and have averaged 23 MPG, but city driving is not well suited to this truck.  Gas mileage drops significantly the more I am in the city.  The handling is the best I have experienced in a truck.  It simply doesn't handle "like a truck".  It feels like a big car.  Sharp corners are easily handled, braking is effortless thanks to four wheel anti-lock disc brakes, and road noise is minimal.

  I would discourage anyone with kids or thinking about kids to buy this truck.  The truck just isn't kid friendly.  The extended or quad cab options would be bearable for children.  But if you're like me and have no children, I would highly recommend this vehicle.  This truck has exceeded my expectations of what a truck should be and I thoroughly enjoy the drive.
