            I have in the past owned a Civic, because my family has always had honda's and loved all of them, and they have always latest years upon years, so I decided to buy the 2000 Honda Accord Sedan. I am impressed by the performance of this car, it performs as well as my Civic did, yet it is much bigger. The mileage is the best part about it. Some people drive SUV's around, but my question is why would you do that when the gas prices are so encredibally high? I mean all SUV'S are gas hogs, something like 12 mpg, that is insane. The Accords is much, much higher. The only reason I can see for driving the SUV's is that they are quite fasionable. But not to practical. The Accord is the opposite. It is very practical, but not really stylish. I have a very limited budget, and the Accord was very nice to me in that respect also. I only payed 16,000 for it, and it came with a free CD player and an above average sound system. Where else can you get that? The trade in value(when it should come around) is one of the highest in the business. Man all these reasons together should be enough for you to go out and get one of these. NOW!!
