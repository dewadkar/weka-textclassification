            After trying a few cheap digital cameras we decided to spend some "real money" and get ourselves a good mega-pixal camera. One night in April 2001, watching the Home Shopping Network we saw the Fuji as a daily special. Priced at $299, and USB compatible, we jumped at it and have been more than pleased with the purchase. Within a few weeks of using the camera we bought an extra smart card on ebay for $30 and got rid of our 35mm Vivitar. We use our Fuji exclusively now and use an online printing service for pictures that we want to keep or frame. The nice thing about this camera is that I was able to start using it within minutes of taking it out of the box, and still haven't read the instruction manual yet! The USB connection makes downloading your pictures a breeze compared to using a serial connection. If you use good quality batteries you can take hundreds of pictures before you have to change them. I like that you can see your picture instantly in the view screen, and the zoom feature lets you zero in on your picture to see if you want to keep or delete it. Even at $300 I think we got a great deal on this camera, so anyone who can get it for less should be really happy with the purchase.
