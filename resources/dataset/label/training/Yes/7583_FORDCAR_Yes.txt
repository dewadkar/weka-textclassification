            Our family of five purchased the Ford Expedition in 1998.  My kids like to call it the &quot;Big Blue Bus.&quot;  They are right, it is Blue and yes, it is very big.  We are certain when our lease is up that we will be buying another Expedition or Navigator(same as the Expedition just more bells and whistles).  We owned a jeep Cherokee previous to this car and as a mother of three I feel that my kids have much more room and are safer in our Expedition.  This car is by far my favorite.  There are only a few negatives I can come up with.  First of all it is a little difficult to get the third seat into the vehicle.  We keep ours in at all times now, but before our third child was born we would switch it in and out -- this was not easy due to the cumbersome seat it was impossible to do alone.
Once the third seat is installed your back hatch storage area is limited, but I just put things in the back seat. I would prefer to have a fold up and down seat in the back.  Also, the kids have to climb over the second seat to get into the back seat.  I think the car would be more functional if the two middle seats were bucket (this feature is on the Navigator.)
Those are the only negatives about the car.  Otherwise, it is a very sturdy, smooth running vehicle that I would definitely recommend to anyone  with a large family.<br><br>
