            I just bought a 99 Grand AM GT 4 door, and I couldn't be happier. Until this point I had owned only Mustangs and vowed that those would be the only car I would ever own...but this car can quite possibly put the stang to shame.

Where should I start?  Well, my car is a 4 door, but it is so sporty that it's not what you would typically call a sedan.  There is so much space that I can comfortably haul 4 normal-large adults it it.

The 6 cyl engine is peppy.  It has no problems with hills or any other obstacle.  After having a doggy 4 cyl engine I can't imagine ever going back.

As for the ride...it is so smooth.  I never feel any of those rough bumps are potholes when I am driving.  I feel like I am riding in air.  And what about all the features???  It comes with power everything, even seats.  The lights come on automatically when it's dark outside.  The stereo system absolutely rocks...you would think that I had some 12s in the back of it.  I really like being able to control the stereo with a touch of a button on the steering wheel.  The sunroof makes the car feel so much more open.  I could go on about this car for days.

This car is great for anyone...whether it be someone looking for a roomy sports car or a roomy family car.  It rides great and the features really add to it.  They are reasonably priced for everything you get.  I paid $16,250 for a 99 with 8000 miles.  Good luck in car shopping!  If you get this car you won't need luck though!!!<br><br>
