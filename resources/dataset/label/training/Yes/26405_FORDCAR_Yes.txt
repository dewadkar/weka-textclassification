            We just made the last payment on our 1996 Ford Windstar GL.
Although we put nearly 100,000 miles on it in its first 3
years, thanks to my husband's long commute, we are both
quite satisfied with the car.

We never wanted to buy a minivan. It's just the two of us,
and when it was time for him to replace his 92 Explorer Sport
with something more suitable for the commute (meaning something
that would conserve gas--and something with an automatic for
the rare days I drove), we went looking for a small, 2 door car.

We looked at everything we fit in--we're both big people, and
some cars are really, really tiny. The Geo Metro looked like
a jelly bean with a man filling. The Monte Carlo made us feel
like we were in the cockpit of an exotic jet. The Honda Civic
was quite roomy (surprise!) but Honda won't provide seatbelt
extenders to its larger clients--not even if you pay. Boo, hiss,
Honda.

Finally I suggested we take a look at the Ford Escort, as I'd had
one, 2 door, in my pre-Tempo days, and it had lots of room.
We tested a new one, and while we fit, it clearly didn't have
the necessary power to haul us around. When we returned to the
dealership, I began drooling over something pretty, and my husband
began wandering. A few minutes later, I heard him giggling.

I'm not getting out, he said.

I wandered until I found him, sitting serenely in a new Windstar,
with lots of room between him and the wheel. Get in, he said.

Please understand, at this point, I firmly believed minivans were
only for moms and were the bastion of suburbia.

I got in. It was easy to step up--no mountain goat climbing like
the Explorer. The seats were firm and comfortable. There was tons
of room up front, and easy access to the back. I even got in back,
and in the way-back--no problems wriggling my big body anywhere.

Then we took it out--and I saw the light--with all that glass and
a few inches of height, you can really see. Not only that, it
was surprisingly easy to drive.

Several weeks and dealers later, we were the proud owners of our
very own, brand new Windstar GL, with all the options. Although
the seatbelts were big enough, we did ask for an extender as
the belts were fully pulled out. At first Ford thought we'd have
to pay, but I showed them the promise of a free extender in 
the service manual--and they honored that.

Overall, the Windstar has plenty of power (we went for the 3.8L
engine) and holds its own on just about any kind of road. We
don't have the traction control option, and yet we managed
to get up our steep hill on the ice all last winter. 

We've had the car 4 years now, and until this year, it has
required only minor repairs (except for when we had an accident).
This year, we took it in for routine servicing and got slammed
with $1500 of engine and head gasket work. We've been faithful
with routine maintenance, and we've kept it clean, and that's
left us with a decent car, even after all these miles. We did
replace the tires at 70,000 miles, but that was because the
wheels were improperly aligned after the accident.

With all the positives, we're not sure we'd buy a Windstar again.
The current versions (like many cars) have a lot less interior space,
and with the extra door on the driver's side, there's not as much
room for a big person behind the wheel. Several years ago, Ford
touted a larger driver's side door for the vehicle, with a tilting
seat for easy back access. If this is still available, then
that might be a great option. However, we've rented several
Plymouth minivans recently, and we've been even more impressed
than with the Windstar.<br><br>
