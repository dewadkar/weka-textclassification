            The Mazda Tribute V6 is terrific value among the sea of SUV's on the market today. For years buyers wanting a good all around Sport Utility had to choose between the undersized, under-powered economy baby-utes, or pony up to overpriced Explorers or even larger mammoths. 

Enter the Tribute V6. It's the size of a small minivan, has the drivetrain of a pickup, but is built on an independent suspension chassis like a car. Add in full or part time 4WD and the result is an extremely capable Sport Utility that's as comfortable on road as off.

I had the pleasure of test driving the Tribute on several occasions after seeing the Tribute at an auto show a year earlier. At the time my wife had just purchased a Honda CR-V and I was anxious to see how well the Tribute could fill the baby-ute to Explorer gap. It did so with flying colors and has us thinking about trading up soon.

Performance

With a 200-hp V6 engine standard on LX and ES models, the Tribute gives the driver a confidence that one would normally expect from a sports car (thanks to a very responsive V6).  The engine provides ample torque to get the vehicle moving quickly, and keeps power handy for maneuvers like merging and passing at highway speeds.  Mazda didn�t slap a truck chassis on the Tribute either like some SUV�s of its size (aka Explorer, Xterra). The Tribute has a fully independent suspension that permits car-like ride and handling characteristics. 

Exterior

While the Tribute doesn�t chart new territory in SUV design, it is handsomely styled with an overall sporty wedge shape with subtle bulges at the fenders to give the vehicle more substance. The lower half of the body including both bumpers is adorned with plastic molding that really gives it a purposeful look, and should serve well to keep water, mud, and other debris from spoiling the sharp looks of a clean paint job. LX and ES models include painted lower molding that adds an more upscale flair to the overall package. 

Mazda keeps the overall look of the Tribute within the Mazda family with front and rear styling look that roughly resemble other makes like the B-Series pickups, Millennia and Prot�g�. This helps keep the Tribute visibly kin to its Mazda siblings and also gives the front end a pouty, aggressive snarl. Integrated foglights are standard on ES, optional on LX.

Large alloy wheels are standard on V6 models and accompanied by all terrain tires that should bite well on a myriad of surfaces. A towing package is available on the ES model. ABS brakes are optional. Drum brakes at the rear are disappointing, but expected for SUV�s in this class.

Interior

Inside, the Tribute is spacious, accommodating 4 large adults (5 to 6 if there are kiddoes in the mix). V6 models come standard with a durable, yet bland cloth interior, while the ES model includes more luxurious leather seating and a power driver�s seat for precise adjustment. Rear seats are unusually comfortable and fold down to add needed expansion to a noticeably cramped cargo area. When the rear seats are in their normal position, cargo area is very limited, a distinction that�s indicative the mini-Ute class. The LX and ES models come with a center console/armrest which has a cavernous storage area. 

 The instrument panel and dash are ho-hum in both styling and materials. It�s functional but not exciting or necessarily well crafted. One Tribute I drove had an annoying squeaking sound that can only be made by two pieces of plastic rubbing together. There�s an especially cheesy dimpled plastic frame around the gauges that would be more at home on a Ford or Suzuki. The stereo system is easy to use and has an optional in-dash CD changer. The sound quality is very good, but most modern cars today have equally good sounding systems. When in the drive position, the column mounted shifter invades the space of the stereo making operation of the controls a bit tedious.

I did notice that when driving the Tribute, the sounds of the V6 tend to invade the interior more than I'd like.

Pricing

The Tribute is a lot of vehicle for the money. The V6 models start in the $21,000 range while a top-of-the-line ES-V6 4WD tops out around $25,500.  This less than you�ll pay for an equally equipped V6 Mitsubishi Montero Sport or Ford Explorer, yet in the same range as the smaller 4-cylinder Toyota RAV 4 or V6 Suzuki Grand Vitara Plus. The Tribute's bottom line is a price might allow you to contemplate what you might want to tow behind your new Tribute.

Other Considerations

This opinion covers the Tribute V6 models. 4-cylinder models, while available were lackluster in equipment and comfort and very underpowered. For those considering these models, the V6 Ford Escape(mechanical twin of the V6 Tribute) might be an affordable alternative.
