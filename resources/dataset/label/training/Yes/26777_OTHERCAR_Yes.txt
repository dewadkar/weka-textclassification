            We bought this vehicle for our 17-year-old son.  We wanted a dependable vehicle that was safe for him to drive and we definitely found it in the Jeep Cherokee.  It is a well-built vehicle.

It is very large inside and has plenty of leg room.  There is plenty of cargo space and the back seat folds down for added room.  It is easy to drive and fun too!  It can get you through just about any situation that you may encounter.

We have taken it on long trips.  It is not as comfortable as a luxury vehicle, but it was bearable.  The steering has a little bit of play, as does the clutch, but it is something you can get used to.

We do not have the four-wheel drive simply because we do not need it where we live.  If ours has gotten us through any situation we have encountered as well as it has, the four-wheel drive must be able to get through anything and everything!

I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants to have fun with a vehicle and have dependable transportation.<br><br>
