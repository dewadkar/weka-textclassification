            I purchased my Villager Nautica 2 years ago (35,000 miles).  It's a great van.  The Nautica version is very nice and an eye turner (blue with white trim).  It drives great and has the power available when you need it (comes with a Maxima engine in it), when you punch it, it goes!  It's also a very comfortable drive with enough room to fit my family comfortably (4 children).  It handles well (a little body sway here and there).  The interior is solidly built with many amenities.  So far, not too many problems.  I had to replace the oil pump shortly after I purchased it ($750.00 to repair).  The rear windshield wiper no longer works.  The brakes tend to make a lot of noise, especially when the rotors heat up (grinding noise).  Haven't figured out why yet.  Had rotors turned and pads replaced.  OK for the first few thousand miles, then starts up again.  And now the check engine light comes on and off (77,000 miles) - no biggie.  Gas mileage is terrible (city) better on the highway though.  Would I buy another one?  Yes.  They have improved many things with the newer models - more horsepower as well.<br><br>
