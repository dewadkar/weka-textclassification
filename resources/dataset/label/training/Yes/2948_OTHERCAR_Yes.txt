            I have purchased a many of Honda vehicles.  I think they are bar far the best car manufacture today.  I owned a 2000 Acura Integra SE from early in 2000 until April 2002.  

Appearance
This car is not the greatest looking car.  It comes with a decent set of 5 stars, and a spoiler.

Performance
The 1.8L engine did pretty well for itself.  Although it is not a FAST car, it has some spunk to it.  Those looking for some real power should definitely look into the GSR or Type R.

Handling
This is what I hated most of this vehicle.  The handling was poor.  I found my 99 civic to handle much better than this car; not to mention it was $4000.00 less!  The car sways, slides, you name it.  It was easily resolved with front and rear strut bars.

Interior
The interior of this vehicle is quite plain.  The seats are somewhat comfortable, until you go on a long drive.  The dash cracked pretty fast ï¿½ even with a regular treatment.  

Features
Acura sure knows how to bundle a good list of features into their cars; CD player, power windows, air, cruise control, etc.  The only thing this car was missing was power-locks, not a big deal for a two-door car.

Maintenance
I went 15,000 km on one batch of oil, I pitty the fool who buys that car, and it drove like new.  The car was great for low maintenance.  The odometer read 70,000 km when I traded it in for my 2002 RSX Type-S, and it still drove very well.
