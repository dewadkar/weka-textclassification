            This car was a &quot;gift&quot; from my husband.  I have never driven anything larger than a Geo Prizm, so I was very happy to see how easy it was to handle.  The car does live up to it's name though - it definately rides like a Jeep.  It fits my 2 cars seats, and all the baby stuff very well.  I found that there is still room between the 2 car seats for an extra person.  We drive it 130 miles each way every 2 weeks to visit my in-laws and it is a very comfortable car. One con is that the back seat is narrow, you do feel as if your backside will slide off the seat.  I was  surprised at how much we could fit in the back.  There is plenty of leg room up front. I would strongly recommend this car to anyone. <br><br>
