            I picked up what appears to be the last DC3200 in the North Dallas area during the preChristmas rush.  I've used it at a couple of gatherings, and the quality is far better than any of the cheaper digital cameras I've tried.  In fact, it looks a fair bit better than many of the $250-350 cameras I looked at.

Photo quality is not really possible, but after running off a picture on photo paper, I'd say that if you are looking for something to frame and hang on the wall, this camera is certainly capable of delivering.  The graininess that exists isn't visible from more than a foot or two from the 5x7 that I printed, and in anything but the best lighting, you have to look for flaws to see them at more than a foot.

Features that it seems to lack are; a bit more intelligent flash control to prevent it washing out close shots, a tripod mount, and timer to allow for those 'run around and get in the picture' shots.

If you're looking for something to help you or a relative get hooked on digital photography without spending an arm and a leg, this is the camera for you.
