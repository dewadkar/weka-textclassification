            I am not an owner of a Corvette, but I had the opportunity to drive a 1997 model for a week when a friend went out of town and left his baby for me to car sit.  Mechanically speaking the car is pretty slick.  The engine has pleantly of power and allows you to pass other cars at high speed without downshifting.  I think Chevy can improve on the stock 345 hp if they made minor factory tweaks like making cold air intake, oversized throtle body, and a free flow exhaust standard equipment instead of leaving that job up to names like K and N and Flowmaster.  The styling is what I don't like about the lastest generation vette.  The interior is very comfortable and seems to wrap around you.  However, the exterior is what i have problems with.  Chevrolet should have looked to its roots when it picked design themes.  Maybe a stingray theme would have been better to use than stealing styling cues off of legendary japanese spots cars.  The front end looks way too similar to the last generation Mazda RX7.  The crease in the side of the body (in the door and fender) is that of Acura's NSX...only reversed.  Also, the door handle looks as if it was taken from a 1994 Acura integra and bolted right on.  Aside from this, the car is pretty nice.  I, however, could never say I liked it because I have had horrible experiences with GM products and dealer service in the past.  I'm partial to the imports because they make rock solid components and dealerships treat me with respect.  Things like washing and waxing my car after a service instead of having some sweaty guy drive my oven hot car (covered with bird droppings) out to me after I have paid humdreds of dollars for service goes a long way.  FYI, my car of choice is a Toyota MR2 turbo (which I have not reviewed yet) which costs a fraction of the vette's price, is lighter on it's feet, has a better seating position, and is much more rare.  I really don't care about top speed and 0-60 times, which BTW are 149 and 5.96 respectively, I just want a car that is right for me.  Besides the midengine set up is one I'm in love with.  The vette is a good car, but it's just not right for me.  Once you have gone mid engine, you never go back. <br><br>
