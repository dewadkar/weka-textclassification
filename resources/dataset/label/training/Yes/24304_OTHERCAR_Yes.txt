            My parents bought it for me and it saved my life in an accident.  The car is well built and strong-I seriously think that another car would have bee crushed completely.  I have driven it back and forth across country and it does very well on road trips.  Never has it overheated or stalled out.  With all of my stuff that I needed to take back and forth from college, the Jeep has made the trips easy and comfortable.  I have the Orvis edition which is still really stylish and in good shape.  I think that it is great for high school/college kids because of the roominess and safety.  
The only complaints that I have is that repairs/checkups are expensive and it has a really large turning radius.  <br><br>
