            (I own a Philips ESP80, which was made by Ricoh, and is identical to the RDC-4300.)

This is my second Ricoh digi-cam, my other being a RDC-2. What I liked about this camera is the high resolution, SmartMedia storage, infrared remote, and a 3x optical zoom.

At 1280x960, the resolution gives plenty of detail. You must beware of the lighting, though. The flash is not very strong and could benefit from a &quot;slave unit&quot;. (I have tried it with a peanut slave and it take much better pictures at night.) During sunlight, the quality is great. I do like the flexibility of seven mode of resolution / compression setting. 

I personally like the SmartMedia storage, for it's ability to be used with a FlashPath floppy adaptor. Pop it in a 3.5 floppy drive and you are ready to download. This being an &quot;older&quot; model, it only supports up to a 8mb chip. But with compression set to SN (high-res, &quot;normal&quot; compression), the included 4mb chip can still store 12 images. 

The remote is great, especially during group shots.

The 3x optical zoom should have been backed up by a digital zoom, but it is adequate for framing an object not too far away. At the time of purchase, it was the standard.

One big complain is how slow it is to actually take a picture. It could take as long as 3/4 of a second between hitting the release and it taking the picture. This created a lot of missed opportunities.
