            I bought a 1997 Moss Green Jeep Wrangler Sport brand new in the spring of 1997 at a Mike Shad dealership in Jacksonville, FL.  At the time, I was interested in a convertible that was reasonably priced (starts well under $20,000) and didn�t have high insurance premiums associated with it.   The Jeep wasn�t my first choice, but after considering the options, it seemed like the best choice.

Through the years the vehicle has been fun to drive but the drive hasn�t always been pleasant.  Since the purchase, I have had a few problems, most of which were cosmetic and have primarily been with the soft-top.  For instance, after a year the seams unraveled and tears developed at two corners on the canvas top.  The Jeep dealer in Tallahassee, FL refused to replace the top and instead resewed the seams. While the repair managed to stop the water leaks, the finished work looked really tacky.  It was quite unfitting for a nearly new, $21,000 vehicle.  A year later the repaired seams burst again.   A dealer in Fort Lauderdale, FL at first suggested that they could try to re-sew it, but after examination opted to replace the top without hesitation. 

Another problem occurred when a petroleum-based chemical that was applied by the factory damaged the door seals along the top.  It was apparently intended to fill gaps in the black plastic doorframe.  The damage was cosmetic but another Jeep dealer in Jacksonville, Florida was kind enough to switch out the half-door tops with new ones without giving me any static.   They also replaced a failing oil pressure sensor.  

One problem in particular caused a lot of aggravation.  The oil filler cap is made of a plastic with a two piece construction.  Well, on one particular afternoon, after I drained the oil from the pan, I couldn't get the filler cap off the engine.  It "froze" on valve cover.  To make matters worse, the top part broke off when I gripped it and turned with a lot of force.  So, with the oil completely drained and with no means of getting the cap off to refill the pan, I was in a real jam.  After several hours of cursing, I finally was able to jury-rig a pipe wrench to grip what little part of the filler cap was sticking out of the engine. A well placed hammer strike worked to break the grip of the plastic. 

The dealership in Tallahassee replaced the cap at no charge and told me that this was not the first incidence they have seen.  They confessed it was really lousy engineering.  No kidding.  Since then I have learned to unscrew the cap first and then drain the oil!  

Aside from a lot of hours wasted for various issues, a 36-month/36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warrantee covered all of the repairs. 

So do I regret buying it?  Considering the problems, I sometimes do.  I live in a city, so I will be the first to admit this vehicle has no practical purpose whatsoever.  I confess that like it solely for its appearance.  But hey, that is why a lot of people like Porsches too.  There is nothing else like a Jeep.  This is one of the few convertibles that can be had under $20K; and it is neither cute nor can it be really classified as a �chick� vehicle.  

What I do like are:

1. The �cool factor.�  With its Moss Green finish and spice color top, alloy wheels and off road tires, it does turn heads.
2. Coil shocks at all four corners.  It produces a much more subdued ride compared to leaf springs.
3. This thing can move.  With 180 hp, it takes off in a flash.  (All right, it won�t beat a Mustang GT, but I can merge in traffic in a pinch.
4. Real easy to service.  The vehicle sits fairly high off the ground.  It�s a breeze to crawl under to change the oil and grease the suspension points.  There is also a coolant drain plug in the block so the fluid can completely be drained from both it and the radiator.
5. The air conditioning works well.  
6. Shift-on-the-fly four wheel drive with high speed range for driving rain and snow, and low range gear for getting out of whatever mess I can get this thing into.
7. Side steps.  Yes, you read me right.  The side steps are hard black plastic that protrude several inches out to the side and almost appear like running boards.  While I never need to use them to enter the vehicle, I appreciate them because they do excellent job protecting the doors from being dinged or dented by careless people in parking lots. 
8. Eighteen-gallon fuel tank.  Trust me, you will need it. 
9. The semi-metallic paint has held up well.
10. Drain plugs in the floor and removable carpeting that buttons together.  This really is a great feature!  You may laugh, but trust me.  You will someday appreciate this.
11. Handles fairly well for an SUV.  While its no car, it does feel quick, agile and unlikely to tip over.  I have seen video with drivers throwing Jeeps Wranglers into 180 degree turns.  I by no means recommend you try something that crazy, but it is nice to know that it is less likely to roll than I previously thought.  And I still take comfort in being surrounded by a tubular steel �roll-cage".
11. Dashboard layout is quite civilized.
12.  The Wrangler did well in the Insurance Institutes Offset Crash Into a Deforming Barrier Test.  It actually was among the top of its class in safety. 
13. Have I already mentioned its �cool factor?�

Dislikes:

1. The noise.  So noisy in fact, that my girlfriend once hesitatingly asked if I was ever concerned about the top flying off as we were barreling down I-95 at 75 miles per hour.  Up to that point, I hadn�t... but ever since then I do!  Rats!  Why did she have to ask me that!?  Jeep reportedly (Oct '00 issue of Car and Driver) has decided to offer a 4-ply soft-top for 2001 model due to the wind noise and buffeting top complaints.  If the new top fits my Jeep I may consider upgrading to it.
2. Again, I mention the soft-top.  The whole process of lowering and raising takes quite a bit of effort.  The rear side windows need to be unzipped and stored; and the rear plastic window has to be rolled up to lower it.  Not to discriminate, but I feel "skinny" folks or people with weak hands may have a difficult time raising the top and latching the two hooks to the windshield.  Cold weather shrinks the canvas making it extremely difficult to engage those latches.  I have to put some weight into the effort.  Sometimes the amount of effort it entails results in shaking the vehicle from side to side as I try to apply as much force as I can to latch the hooks in place.
3. The plastic windows also scratch too easily and forbid storing anything valuable in the vehicle.  Although optional steel �add-a-trunk� is an available it is ridiculously expensive and small.  I find it laughable that Jeep even bothered to put locks on the doors.  I don�t ever lock them because I feel it will only provoke a bad-guy into slashing the expensive side windows to enter the vehicle.  To thwart such an attack, I had an alarm system with motion sensors installed.  
4. For some reason, the front tires wear improperly.  Other Wrangler owners I have talked to complain of this.  I took it to the Jeep dealer in Jacksonville thinking the wheels were out of alignment.  But I was told that the problem was not the alignment but that the wheels were out of balance causing the tires to develop a chop the tread pattern.  They balanced and rotated the Goodyear GS-A�s but the problem persisted.   I have had several shops align and balance the vehicle but 2 of the 3 said everything was within specification.  I don�t know if the specs they are using are wrong or if there is a flaw with the tires or suspension.   If anyone has some suggestions, I certainly would appreciate the input.
5. Lousy radio.  I am thankful that I opted for the optional sound-bar though.
6. Although the handling is improved with coils springs, it still provides a pretty rough ride.  The suspension has two solid axles so no matter what shocks or springs are applied, it will always drive like a truck.  
7. The 5-speed gearbox is unrefined and isn�t even rated strong enough to tow a boat.  About the biggest thing I can hope to haul is a personal watercraft.
8. �Spice� color interior often develops a dirt like film that is hard to remove from the vinyl surfaces and carpeting.  Again, other Wrangler owners I have talked to complain about this.  I find Clear Guard works pretty well but I still have to use a lot of elbow grease to remove the film.
9. This vehicle guzzles gas.  I average about 14-16 miles per gallon.  That�s why is it nice to have that 18-gallon tank!
10. High price for the Sport model with options compared to the 4 cylinder. 

While there are more practical vehicles out there, the Wrangler is a lot of fun and does turn heads.  I hate to admit it, but those two reasons alone is why I still own this vehicle today.  

Good luck.
