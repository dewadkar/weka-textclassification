            The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a top quality vehical. For one thing it looks real good, with a sleek design. Also the Jepp holds up. My family has had a jeep for a few years now, and it still goes strong. Also the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited is very comfortable, with luxuries like heated seats, soft leather, and good legroom. With this Jeep you will feel the power as you go along the road. It handles almost like a car, good power stearing. It is a great vehical, I highly recomend it. Thank you for reading my opinion. You can trust this paragraph.<br><br>
