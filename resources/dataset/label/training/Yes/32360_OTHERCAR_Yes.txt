            The 1995 Volkswagen Jetta is a car for anybody.  While it still proves to be an efficient automobile, it also provides more fun to driving that would normally be boring.  I first wanted this car for the fun and unique commercials that Volkswagen created for it, but also for its looks.  Once this car became mine, however, I found out that driving seemed to a much more fun experience.  It has incredible handling, and an amazing turning radius.  Even its efficiency proves to be great.  I have the 4-cylinder version of this car, and am still able to get a substantial amount of power from the engine.  The interior of the car is also great.  There is enough space to comfortably fit four people, and it has a large trunk as well.  My GLS also has automatic windows, automatic locks, an alarm system, child-safe rear doors and heated front seats.  While I have had this car for about a year or so now, I have only found two dislikes to it.  Firstly is the cup holders for the front seat.  There is only enough room to fit cans here, and even in this case it seems to hit the console area easily.  On the upside, however, larger cups can fit into a holder found at the rear of the center console in the back.  The other downside to this car was its audio.  Despite its claim to be a &quot;premium&quot; audio system, it really doesn't seem to put out much.  This is not much of a problem for many people, but as I am a teenage guy in need of better sound, I quickly fixed this to sound clearer and better.  I would recommend this car for anyone, teenager to adult, and also to families.  Simply reading this opinion won't give the full experience and fun that the Volkswagen Jetta has, and I suggest having a test drive at a local dealership.<br><br>
