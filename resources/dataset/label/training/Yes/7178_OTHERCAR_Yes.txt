            My father noticed this car for me when I was 16.  I am now 17 and really enjoying it!  I have the SR5 package, all power options, K&N Air Filter, Off-road shocks, brush guard, A/T tires, and a sound system.  I thought that this car would be good for the winters in Chicago, IL, and boy was I right.  This thing is the best 4x4 on the road and especially for snow or rainy conditions.  I also wanted something to grab attention, especially form the female crowd.  Once again, the 4Runner lived up to my expectations.  If you look at any other 1991 vehicle you would think that the 4Runner is the most recent looking.  It looks brand new!  It also rides like a true truck, not a little "BMW Comfort Ride Plus", another perfect feature.

I have had a few problems with it, and here they are:
1)  Rear window would not go down.  Fixed= $200
2)  Negative battery terminal needed replacing.  Fixed=$2.12
3)  No More Problems!

My only dislike is the lack of power and the lack of MPG.  Right now I'm currently averaging about 13 MPG.  The lack of power cannot be fixed, but oh well.  Everything else in the car makes up for it!  Excellent automobile.  Right now there is 126,000 miles on it and running strong!
