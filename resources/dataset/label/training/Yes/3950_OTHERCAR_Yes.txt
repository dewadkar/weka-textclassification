             I bought my Saturn LS2 2000 in November of 1999. At that time I was possibly carrying twins and we needed a car that would be both roomy and safe. We originally were going to buy a truck but the prices were just out of hand for even a base model.

 When I first saw the LS2, I could not believe the size. I could actually fit 3 car seats in the rear or two and one adult very comfortably. There is even room under the rear seat for tall people to put their legs. The front is also very roomy. My father at 6'3'' has no problem with leg space. We were also looking for a lot of trunk space. I easily fit not only my child's carriage, but also groceries, diaper bag and still have room. I took my parents to the airport and easily fit all their luggage in the trunk. It is one of the largest trunks I have seen for the price range. But while space is a good quality, there are some bad qualities too.

What don't I like about my Saturn?? Well it's very hard to see out the rear window. The trunk sits very high making visibility poor. It is very hard to park the car since I don't know how far I am from the car behind me. Make sure to check this when you test drive. It is something I forgot. 

The above is the only bad quality with the car. It has great pickup and gives a very smooth quiet ride. The car is equipped with dual airbags and safety bars in the side doors. I feel very safe driving this car.
Another good quality is service. Service is terrific and you become part of the Saturn family. They constantly send little freebies such as phone cards, trips to auto shows, and bbq's. Service is excellent, and for that alone I would buy a Saturn again.
This car is a family car. I recommend it to anyone who likes a classy car with a lot of room.I enjoy my Saturn, and will never regret getting a car with mega trunk space.<br><br>
