            Car shopping i hate it. I had so many different kind of cars in my life time,but there is one car i would recommend to anyone.I had a 1987 olds cutlass ciera.I bought this car used back in 1989.This was the best car i ever had.I never had any problem with it other than general service that you would have with any car.It had so many nice features on it.It had a beeper to let you know when you left the lights on or when your turn signals where on.It was very good on gas.I use to get at least 50 miles to a gallon of gas. It had front wheel drive and that work`s great.I also had a 4 wheel drive and i used my Oldsmobile in the snow before i would use my four wheel drive.It was much better to handle I had 300,000 miles on the engine before i had to replace the engine.The second engine was just as good.It was a 4 cylinder block and worked better than any 6 or 8 i ever had.I know other people with oldsmobiles and love them as well as i did mine.<br><br>
