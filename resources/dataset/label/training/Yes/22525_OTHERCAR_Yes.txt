            Chevrolet Cavalier -- A Great Car. It was my first NEW car.  Very reasonably priced.  I wanted a sun roof, but didn't get one with the model I purchased.  Oh well, there is always next time.  Yes, I would recommend this car to all of my readers.  It is very good at the gas pump.  Maybe if you have children I would recommend the four-door model, though.  

Driving a Cavalier is very enjoyable.  Soft and quiet ride (unless the baby and dog are crying!!).   It also holds up terrific in the winter weather.  Everyone should buy a Cavalier.  Okay; maybe not my 95-year-old uncle.  But, everyone else.  

You cannot beat driving a Chevrolet Cavalier!  Go BUY one today! <br><br>
