            With a family of 7 we spent a LOT of money on photo developing.  I had been wanting a digital camera for quite some time but hadn't found a decent one in my price range since I would have to buy a good photo printer to go along with it.

This camera was quite an impulse buy.  We were browsing through Walmart and I saw this camera for sale with a Kodak Personal Picture Maker from Lexmark in a package deal for $199.  Now, I usually don't buy electronic equipment from Walmart because I view thier Electronics department as very sub-standard. (Instert plug for Best Buy here!)

Upon getting home with our new toy, I immediately started snapping pictures.  Set-up was a breeze and this camera's features are wonderful.  It is very easy to understand and use for the beginner, but has features that an avid photographer would admire.

I quickly found that without a memory card you don't get very far with this camera.  I am able to store 6 pictures in the best setting on the internal 2mb memory of the camera.  

This cameras features include 3 flash settings: auto flash, full time flash and no flash.  I almost always use no flash because the flash in this camera is EXTREMELY bright and washes out anything taken in just about any light.  I actually took a picture of a friend in the pitch black of night with the flash on and it came out clear as day, I don't think it needs to be that bright.
Other features are: A 2x zoom setting. I never use this feature because it is only available in the "good" setting and I always take my pictures in "best".  It has a preview screen on the back that you can set to on or off, and can also turn on the quickview feature that shows you your picture immediately after it is taken.  If you use the preview feature be prepared with a LOT of batteries on hand.

This camera comes with software for uploading and editing pictures.  Uploading pictures is very easy, although very time and battery consuming.  For 6 pictures I allow at least 10 minutes for uploading.
The photo editing software is great.  You can crop, enhance, make photo greeting cards (although they only include Christmas templates), and print multiple pictures on 1 sheet of paper.  

This camera takes amazingly clear and vivid pictures as long as you have fresh batteries.  As the batteries age the capture time prolongs and you get some fuzziness and blurring.

If you do go ahead and buy this Camera you will need to buy a memory card, I find that an 8mb card is sufficient for normal use. A lens cover, and usb a memory card reader to speed up the uploading time and save on battery life.

This camera alone retails for $119 at Walmart, although I have seen it as high as $179.  I recommend the package deal for maximum cost efficiency.

I plan to write a review on the printer seperately.
