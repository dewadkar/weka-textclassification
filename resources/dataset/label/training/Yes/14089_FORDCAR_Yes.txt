            I purchased my 1994 GT in May of 1994. Criteria for selection included 4-passenger availability, easy access to all controls (I'm 5'4&quot; and can't reach controls on most sports cars without subjecting myself to arm-lengthening surgery), general safety, and highway-speed handling. 

The car I purchased was GT trim with all options for that year with the exception of leather seating and the 17&quot; wheels. (Cars outfitted with the 17-inchers had significant nosedive with heavy braking during my road tests--an instant disqualifier.)

It's now July of 2000, the car is 6 years old and I have 108,500 miles on it. I drive primarily on local highways (New Jersey/Pennsylvania) and it is my primary car. Mileage is surprizing for the 5.0L V8--26 city/32 highway when new, down to 22 city/29 highway now--quite a bit better than my previous car (a Plymouth Acclaim 4-banger). Handling is quite tight even after all the mileage. The car handles well at most speeds but has a disturbing tendancy to &quot;float&quot; at speeds over 120 mph. Wet weather travel isn't bad, but high-speed travel on wet roads is a no-no. This is not a good car in snow--it tries, and the ABS helps control the inevitable fishtailing, but the car has real problems gaining any semblance of traction even in light show.

Fit and finish have deteriorated somewhat--the front bumper/fascia has some delamination and peeling, and the black paint on the hood has numerous tiny chips from road debris--but the join seams for hood, doors, and trunk are evenly spaced and the panels are flush. 

Service on the car has been minimal. I usually change the oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles and flush the transmission every 40,000. I've put 4 sets of tires on the pony, 2 sets of windshield wipers, replaced a seatbelt that my dog chewed through, and fried an inexpensive switch in the AC unit driving through bumper-to-bumper in South Chicago in August. Still running on orig. rakes, 4-speed A/T, and everything else. Brake rotors are slightly warped and have been since 1995--the dealer wouldn't touch any warrantee on them, and my local garage has checked them to verify that they're safe to drive on. In the annoying but not fatal category, the stereo picks up interference from the windshieldwiper motor and makes annoying clicks when the wipers are set to intermittant.

Overall, it's been a good commuting car with a bit of zip and style. The back seat is adequate for dogs and storage, but cramped for human occupancy. The flop-down rear seats are a real plus for long items like 2x4x8 lumber and skis. It's a reliable car that's fun to drive and handles honestly under a variety of road conditions.
