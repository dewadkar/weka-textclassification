            	I do not believe highly in Ford vehicles or even the modern SUV craze, but I must say this is an exception. Not only does it have a turning radius better then my Sister's Honda, but it also rides smoother. It has less space then a Suburban in the rear, not to worry though it has the same towing capacity.
	 The Expedition carries as many as eight people quite comfortably. The Expedition clearly takes higher rank on the mpg. It's acceleration is a bit slower and over all speed is slower, but why rush when you are sitting in comfortably cushioned seats that have adjustable lower back paddings and the normal adjustable movements. 
	One minor problem is the exiting from the far back row. It is raised a little higher then the rest of the seats so it makes it a little more difficult to either walk over the seat in front of you or try and find the lever to fold the seat forward. 
	So even though it may cost you a little more in gas than a sedan or compact, it will save you money in insurance and it is a car you wouldn't mind just cruisin' down PCH during a beautiful California sunset.<br><br>
