            I have owned a series of cars in my life so far- and I am still in college.  The first car was a Ford Tempo, then a Chevy Cavalier.  They were older cars but they worked just fine for me, problems and all.  Eventually I had to sell both of them. Then I got spoiled drove my parents BMW ('90) and Saab ('95) to college.  They were nice cars.  But after those few luxurious months I really didn't have a car of my own.  I had rode in SUV's before and tested them out but they were just to big for me at the time.  So I asked around and heard a lot of positive things about Subaru cars.  Their cars were the first to come out with all wheel drive.  I was primarily interested in getting an Outback Sport but fell in love with a 1998 Subaru Impreza at the car dealership.  Needless to say I purchased it for just over 15,000 dollars. 
It drives very smooth on the road and takes curves incredibly well!  The car has dual airbags, which is a must for me in a car.  And if you are really into outdoor sports, then you will enjoy this car.  First off, I put up a rack so bikes, snowboards, or camping backpacks can fit on it easily. This car is perfect for that kind of stuff.  As far as the anti-lock breaks go, I will tell you a little about that. I work at a snow resort in the winter so I had to drive a 45 minute commute to work everyday- rain, snow, or shine!  The car did just fine. Another time my boyfriend and I were coming home from college and we were practically the only car on the road besides a ton of trucks due to the weather.  The whole road was a sheet of ice, and ice rain continued to pour down on us.  We drove so slow and carefully, and managed to pull through another hour before deciding to pull over. This car has helped me out through some risky times on the road.  The impreza also gets great mileage on the freeway.  It doesn't soak up as much gas as my last few cars.  The car is almost up to 40,000 miles and I haven't had to take it to the repair shop yet.  Every 15,000 miles or so I will take it to the dealership to get a thorough inspection and check up.  I find it to be a very economical and reliable car.  As far as the features of the car go, besides power windows and door lock- I don't know what to tell you.  I got the car minus the cd player and goodies like that, but there are quite a few options available for owners to choose from.
The major setback of the car is that the leg space in the back of the car is not great at all.  Another thing is that the breaks squeak every once in a while, and it doesn't mean you need to get your break pads replaced. The trunk space is decent for the size of the car, but it can be rough sometimes moving stuff to college.  And don't get this car in black like I did, it shows minor scratches and key scraps VERY easily. Other than that I can't think of any other bad things to say about the car! I think its great.
