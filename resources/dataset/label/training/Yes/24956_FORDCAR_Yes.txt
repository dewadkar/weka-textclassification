            I graduated from college this summer and the car that I had been driving for 3 years (owned by my father) was taken away when I got a job so that I could purchase my own car.  I looked for several months and finally decided to purchase an older model mustang (91 with 75,000) because I did not like the new 99 model at all during several test drives.  I felt cramped inside the car, and while I am a larger man, I'm not that large that I should feel cramped into a car that HAS a back seat.  The ceiling seemed very low and I did not like the way the car drove.   The older model was much more reasonably priced and I really liked the way it drove much better.  This is probably not all that exciting an epinion for somebody looking to purchase a new mustang, but I wanted to give my opinion.  Thanks!<br><br>
