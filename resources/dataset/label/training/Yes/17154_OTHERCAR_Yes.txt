            Practical Sports Car.

That phrase seems like an oxymoron, doesn't it.  I thought so until I looked at the Mercedes SLK230.  As the resident auto expert, I accompanied my father when he went looking for a new car last month.  He was looking to replace his 1995 Camry XLE, probably with another Camry.  Under my persuasion, he visited the Mercedes dealership to look at the C class automobiles.  When we stepped into the showroom, my usually practical father walked straight to the 1998 Yellow SLK230.  The rest, as they say, is history.

The beauty of the SLK is it's versatility.  A sunny day and playful mood puts you behind the wheel of a two-seat, no trunk, convertible sports car.  A little bad weather and you're driving a coupe with plenty of trunk room, tons of luxury, and a traction control system that makes you feel as if you could drive on an iceberg.

Although the car is small, it is very roomy on the inside.  I am about 6'2&quot;, and it seems as though 5'10&quot; of it is legs, so I can rarely fit inside a sports car.  In the SLK, however, I actually have to scoot the seat up a couple of inches for optimum comfort.

These are my favorite features of the car:
- Retractable Hard Top: Coupe to Convertible in 25 seconds.
- Engine: 2.3 Liter Supercharged 4, 185hp, Beat my friend's 5.0
- Traction Control: Makes you look like a pro, even if you suck
- Sound System: Tweeters, Woofers, and Subs hidden between the cockpit and trunk.  Friends don't believe it's factory.
- Looks: Ours looks like the picture on the Epinions site. Enough Said.<br><br>
