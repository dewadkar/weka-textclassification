                 When I went looking to see which car to buy, I wasn't sure, but I knew I wanted a Ford. Ford cars are good and reliable. When I saw this car, I knew I wanted to buy it. It seemed like something I would enjoy driving for years, and I was looking for something affordable, but dependable. The people who ought to buy this car should be looking for just a car to drive to work (that isn't far away from home. till about 25 miles or so)
      It's not a luxury car, but if you want something to get you where you need, this is the best buy. In my case, I needed to drive to and from work, and to places in the city. Maybe a few stores, meeting, and so on. 
      What I love about the car is this. You won't waste all your money on gas. Since I just need the car for what I mentioned above, I don't need it to be huge. It's nice and simple. 
      To drive this car is a wonder. On the highway, it takes just a few seconds to get it going full speed, although it isn't such a mighty car like a jeep. Although, the car might look dull, it's a great buy. Like I said, people who won't drive across the country should definitely think about buying this car. 
      All four years that I have owned it, I have been more that pleased to be seen driving this car. It's just a pleasure to have parked in the driveway. Basically, the only thing I would have liked to have is more power, which is why it's a compact car that wouldn't be taken on major trips with your family of five. Well, I hope you'll take this car into major consideration as you purchase your vehicle. GOOD LUCK!<br><br>
