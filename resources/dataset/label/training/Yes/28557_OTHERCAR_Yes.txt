            While certainly not for everyone, the Jeep Wrangler can be a real blast for the right type of person.  What most impressed me about my recently-purchased 2000 Wrangler was the modular design.  Want to have fun?  Remove the top.  Heck, even remove the doors!  Need some cargo space?  Pull out those back seats and leave them at home.  Dirty interior?  Hose it down and open the drain plugs in the floorboard.  Then, when you're tired of being rained on, install the hard top, crank up the CD player and forget that you're in an offroad vehicle (well, almost).

Although it may seem obvious, I would not recommend a Wrangler if you're overly concerned about luxury, safety or security.  While the suspension has come a long way recently, this is still a 4WD vehicle and drives as such.  For the same reason, reasonable caution is needed while driving in difficult situations.  And, due to the utilitarian nature of the roof and doors, they're easily broken into.  Detach your stereo and take *everything* with you when you leave the vehicle.  If any of these things could potentially drive you nuts, don't buy one.

The post-97 Wrangler is a bit more &quot;civilized&quot;, with a more car-like dash and better interior.  They have also returned to a more classic design with the rounded headlights and sloping grille.  

Recommendations:  Get the 5-speed and the 6-cylinder engine.  This is essentially an offroad vehicle, so you might as well get the most enjoyment out of it.  The lousy gas mileage is somewhat compensated for by the sheer enjoyment of the ride.  Also highly recommended is the larger tire group, which allows more clearance and sits up a bit higher.  ABS is available as well, for those so inclined.

If you haven't been scared off yet, go out there and get one!  You'll have a lot of fun.<br><br>
