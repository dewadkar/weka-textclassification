            I have owend an '87 900 Turbo for about a year. (Looks just like the one picutred above, in fact.)  I think it's a great car.  Does great in the snow, has HUGE cargo capacity, and is fun to drive.  
A couple of caveats.  One, while they are cheap to buy, you will probably have to put a couple hundred bucks a year into your Saab.  (I think this is a fair tradeoff, but those seeking uncompromising reliability might look elsewhere.)  Also, the non-turbo Saabs are a bit slow, and certainly not as powerful as the turbos.
All in all, I think these are great cars and certainly have a lot more personality than a lot of others on the road.<br>
