            The Honda Accord is one of the best buys on the road.  With the appearance of a larger sports car, the Accord is not only safe but also sporty. It has four-passenger cargo with lots of room and comfort.  Bucket seats are a plus for small children.  The car is approximately 12 feet in length, yet trunk space is a little slack.  The trunk is the only problem with this wonderful car.  You most often see Honda Accords on long trips with luggage holders on the top.  With the use of a luggage holder, it is great for long trips because the seats can lie down and turned into what seems to be a small bed for the children.  Your kids will be comfy, you will be comfy, and you will arrive at your destination safely.  It has crash features such as a small, compact frame and a breakaway hood.  It is definitely the car for a family or anyone who loves to ride smoothly.  Great Buy!!<br><br>
