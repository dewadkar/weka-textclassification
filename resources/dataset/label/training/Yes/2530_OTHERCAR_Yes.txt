            The Pontiac Montana is really like a Mom's best friend. It's low enough to the ground that it's easy to get into.  It feels like driving a car not a mini van.  The sliding door is great for car-pooling, as well as being convenient when loading groceries, or family members on the go.  We stay on the road a good bit and the television screen has really come in handy.  The kids don't whine are argue as much and the question before we leave is &quot;How many movies will it take us to get there?&quot;. They can hook up earphones to the system and listen and the driver can still listen to music without all the loud noise from a loud TV.

There are a total of 7 seats that were truly designed for people and busy lifestyles.  There are 5 seats in the rear that are foldable, moveable and removable.  You can make extra space for even the largest things just by reaching under the seat and pushing down on a bar. Quick and easy.

There are only 2 things that I have found that could be improved.  The back seats are not as comfortable as they could be (for an adult for long traveling) and there isn't enough storage room in the back for lots of luggage.  But is does have a storage rack on top and they do make an extended model with more room in the rear.

Also: Great on Gas.
      Optional tinted windows
