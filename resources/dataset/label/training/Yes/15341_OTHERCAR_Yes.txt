            I bought this product to take lots and lots of pictures that I planned to use for slide shows, interactive cdroms, emails, and personal uses.  I know there is a craze out there these days for digital cameras, and after falling into the trend, I sometimes wonder why.   The novelty of digital cameras is convenient, but I still prefer looking at pictures, and showing them to people if they are on paper.  If you are looking email and simple picture uses, some that you may not look at often, I suggest you look at much cheaper cameras.  On that note:

The best thing about this camera is the floppy disk.  Since Sony holds the patent, you are out of luck on brands.   It is a great feature because you don't have to have computer around to take all the pictures you want.... to make this clear, a limiting factor in with real film is that you only have a certain number of shots and a relatively costly development process, and with non-floppy cameras, you are still weary of how many pics you take b/c you only have so much space.  However, with disks, you take lots of pictures - cuz you don't need a computer and you can find disks easily... this is an awesome feature.  I took 4000 pictures within the first 2 weeks that I owned it.  You can also copy a disk and give copies to people that you took pictures of, you can show them on a television - it is very convenient for people that might be going to far away places and don't have a computer to take.  You don't have to have the camera with you to put the pictures in a computer - this frees up the camera for lots of other things.  And you can take pictures for people other than yourself - they don't need to borrow your camera, take it to a computer, figure out how to connect it, upload... you get the idea.

It also takes good hi resolution pictures.  It is NOT the best camera in low light situations (I hear Kodaks are much better in this aspect), and pictures often come out with a yellow tint (easily correctable on the computer) if taken with a flash.  It doesn't take good action pictures at all.... the 91 is much better at that b/c it has a variable shutter speed.  

The only thing that really annoys me is that it takes pictures a moment after you press the button, it may not sound so bad, but if you are trying to take another picture quickly, you tend to think the picture is taken when it hasn't finished, so you move the camera while it is taking the photo and it comes out blurry.   THIS SUCKS, especially because it isn't always clear on the LCD panel.

Once you get used to these issues, I don't think there is a better camera out there for convenience.   I take lots of pictures with it, and I correct them as needed with the computer, but it comes into many creative uses.   If you don't plan on using it much or have no REAL need for hi resolution pictures, I recommend a cheaper camera. 

P.S. The video feature is also very nice, it puts them in a standard MPEG format, and although I haven't found all that many uses for it, it is perfect for the occasions when I do use it.
