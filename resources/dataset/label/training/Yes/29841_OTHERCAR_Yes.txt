            This car is really fast if you get the V-6 duster model.  The top speed is 120 "unless you remove the govener then it is even faster!"  I have raced some low end camaros and won!  The car looks sporty as well.  With the spoiler and tinted windows you'll be cruisin' in style with a minimal investment.  

I have noticed the gas milage has gone down considerbly since i purchased it 6 years ago.  I used to get around 18 MPG in town now i am lucky to get 15 MPG.  These figures are lower than what other people may get because i drive this car HARD!  It is difficult not to drive this car hard, it is so fun to drive.  The small size allows you to zoom in and out of traffic!  Equip yourself with a Radar Detector and Jammer and you'll be driving worry free!

The main reason I purchased the car was to put a stereo in it.  The hatchback allows high SPL without the seat taking away from the bass.  I always leave the seat folded down unless someone has to sit in the back seat of course.  I have not found a better suited car for an awesome car audio system!

As for repairs, I have purchased a new transmission, waterpump, EGR valve, had 3 oil leaks fixed "bad gaskets" new wheel bearing, and other various little things.  But like I said earlier, I drive this thing like mad and it stands up to the abuse MUCH better than any other vehicle I have ever owed, and that is why I still have it.

The airbag also seems to work very well!  I used it once, and it saved me from injury I am sure.  I would never buy a car without an airbag.  I however don't ever want to use it again...yikes!

My only complaint is that they don't make these cars anymore!  I want a new one!

This is also a very comfortable car to drive, I recommend you throw in a set of Genuine sheepskin seat covers and a nice matching dashboard cover.

If you find a low milage duster 1993 or 1994 for a good price, BUY IT!!!!!
