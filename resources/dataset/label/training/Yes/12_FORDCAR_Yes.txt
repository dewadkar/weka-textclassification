            Choose the Ford Taurus, and you won't be disappointed.  Responsive, roomy, and very comfortable.  Three important tips you won't hear elsewhere:
1) You can turn the Taurus into a luxury car with one of the feature packages.  Leather seats (VERY nicely done), moon-roof (no leaks), and 6-CD changer (it's in the trunk), heated side-view mirrors, and power everything.  The features are worth the price.
2) The Taurus holds up well in a fender bender.  I was hit at low speed while my car was standing still.  My Taurus only had scratches, but on the other car, the front bumper, hood, and lights all crumpled!
3) Bargain for your Taurus.  Manufacturers are offering dealers special incentives, that allow the dealer to sell to you near invoice price!  Just check out www.edmunds.com
