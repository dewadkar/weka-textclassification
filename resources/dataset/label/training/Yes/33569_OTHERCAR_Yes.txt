            I recently test drove the 2001 Grand Vitara on the recommendation of a friend. As many, Suzuki automobiles have not figured prominently in my auto buying plans. However, I would like to give this vehicle my stamp of enthusiastic approval. Of course there are some less than ideal features as well.

First, I don't care what anyone else says, this SUV has pop. To the people who wrote that it just didn't have enough power, I ask, &quot;Were you thinking of the RAV4 or CRV?&quot;. While not a Porsche, this SUV accelerates smoothly, but seems to have a power surge around the 3000 rpm mark, reminiscent of the characteristic power band in their motorcycles (2 stroke). At 70 mph, the engine was only turning around 3200 rpm. 

The ride is smooth, for such a short wheel base, I found it performed well. Additionally, the ride noise is minimal. A normal volume conversation with rear seat occupants was no problem. 

And the head room, fantastic. My wife could wear a tiarra with christmas lights and not snag the ceiling.

On the disappointing side were leg room in the rear seats, and cargo space in back. However, the new addition (XL-7) answers this problem. Back to the Grand Vitara, the leg room is a serious issue if driver and front passengers have their seats back. I doubt adults in the back would be happy about a 4 hour car ride to the ski resort in those conditions. 

The cargo space is limiting too, I don't know what to tell you about that. Folding the seats down makes it a roomier cargo area but obviously limits occupants.

Overall, I really like this vehicle. If the size disadvantage is really not an issue, I can't see purchasing any other vehicle in its class (other than the issue of future resale value?).<br><br>
