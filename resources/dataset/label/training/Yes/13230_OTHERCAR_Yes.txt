            We've had many vehicles including vans over the years, but the Grand Voyager is a great van.  We thought about buying one last year (1998), it happened this year 1999.  It's a great family vehicle, very roomy for our family of 5, the seats move in and out very easily, it handles with great ease in all types of traffic, highway conditions, and all types of weather.  We are a traveling family and have put over 10,000 miles on it in 5 months, it gets great gas mileage, we average 20-22 in the city (we live in Denver) and 22-25 on the highway.  I'd recommend this vehicle hands down over others. It's long, so those who haven't had much experience my not like it. <br><br>
