            In my family, we have owned three different 1992 Toyota Corollas.  They have all surpassed all expectations.

Our first Corolla was bought in 1992, brand new.  It was our first car with air conditioning and a reasonably good working cassette player.  Such were the luxuries in those days.  It belonged to my father, although my brother and I both used it from time to time.  For three years, my father worked in Vermont and commuted over the mountains from his home in Southern New Hampshire, a round trip of 200 miles each day with hardly ever a problem.  By the time the car finally met its end, it had traveled over 303,000 miles, a remarkable achievement for any car.

My father's next car was a hand-me-down from his older brother, also a 1992 Toyota Corolla by sheer coincidence.  And while he no longer commutes 200 miles a day, he still works on the other side of some formidable hills and puts on a healthy 100 miles round trip.  For a man who makes such ludicrous trips to work, there could be no better car.

So when I was looking for a used car two years ago, it seemed more than just a coincidence that I should find a very affordable, immaculately kept 1992 Toyota Corolla All Trac Wagon.  The body was different, but everything else about the car was the same.  The previous owner had put on a mere 62,000 miles in six years of ownership.  It seemed too good to be true.

In the two years I have owned it, I have almost doubled the mileage and made minimal repairs.  It is, quite simply, the most reliable car I have ever had the joy to drive.  And while I realize that people develop love affairs with cars for very superficial reasons - for instance, they own it - I feel that I can state with confidence that the Corolla is an exceptionally built car.

I fear that by the time I am ready to buy the next car, another 200,000 miles down the road, the 1992's will be in short supply, but I am sure that the later models are equally as joyful to drive.<br><br>
