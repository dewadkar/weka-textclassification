            This car is my family's third Honda Automobile, replacing our aging (250,000 miles gauged) 1986 Honda Accord. It is reliable, comfortable, and has exceptional handling even after five and a half years (and 65,000 miles) of use.

This Accord has a five speed manual transmission coupled with a fairly responsive four liter engine. Although the engine doesn't sound overly impressive, it does provide good balance between fuel economy and acceleration. Expect about 29 MPG in mixed driving. The V6 equipped models perform even better, but at the cost of extra fuel consumption.

Driving or riding in an Accord is generally a pleasant experience. The seats provide plenty of space for all but the tallest people, and the controls are easy to reach and operate. The car also provides a firm rather than cushy ride, which I find keeps me from getting carsick (results may vary between individuals). My only complaint is excessive noise in the cabin at high speeds. The Accord is slightly noisier than comparable sedans such as the Toyota Camry. 

In terms of safety, the Accord is well prepared for unfortunate accidents. Reinforced steel side impact doors, three point seat belts, and dual front seat airbags lend peace of mind on all trips. 

The Honda Accord makes a great sedan for almost anyone. The combination of performance, reliability, and comfort should make this automobile a compelling option for anyone in the market for a new car.
