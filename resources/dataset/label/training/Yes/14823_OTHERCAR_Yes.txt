            My little Mazda Protege' has been more than I ever could have expected from a compact car.  My sister has a Honda, and while I can say that the two are comparable, I must admit that I had her considering a trade-in (Which I belive is significant.  Honda's are supposed to be &quot;the best.&quot;)  
My husband and I bought this vehicle because while he was relocated to a new city and I had to remain 350 miles away with our children to complete a teaching contract.  We had an old car that we deemed unsafe and unreliable, so we decided to take the jump and buy a new car (this was the first new car on both sides of my family).  We were primarily concerned with safety, with reliability second, as my husband would be far away, and our travels would be frequent.

We picked our Protege' after discerning the 50,000 mile warranty from the rest and decided it would be the biggest bang for our buck.  Believe me, it has been the greatest investment.  In a year and half, we've almost reached those 50,000 miles (remember all the travel?), and we have yet to have any engine problems.

Our baby is a sweetie.  Lots of room (my husband's 6'4 and he fits!) when compared to other cars in its class, smooth handling, and clean shifting in the automatic transmission (don't have to wait for it to &quot;kick in&quot;).  I expect to keep this little baby for my baby's college car (she's 2 1/2 now).

Consider test driving one today.<br><br>
