            We bought this car in March of 1995 brand new after my wife turned over the Cavalier she had in the bad weather. 

The 1994 Camaro was the first year of the new look and design, it has changed a little since. It was the first year that they replace the R-12 coolant in the air-conditioning system with the new R-134a, to this date the air-conditioner still works great. This was the first year that the Camaro had dual front air bags standard. 

Our Camaro came in what they call a Patriot Red, I call it a Maroon Metallic. It has a Charcoal Grey and Black interior and came with aluminum wheels. It has a Tilt Steering wheel and Intermediate Wipers. It has a powerful V6 and a three speed with overdrive automatic. It is the 2 Door Coupe model. 

The V6 is a 3.4 Liters with 180 HP that will get up and go. Around town my wife gets about 21 miles to the gallon and on long trips it get just slightly over 30 miles per gallon.

Ours has an AM/FM Cassette, we donï¿½t use the cassette anymore, I wished it would have had the CD player.

It has a four-wheel anti-lock brake system with disc brakes on the front. 

It came with a 3 year bumper to bumper warranty and 3 year of 24-hour roadside assistance. 

<b>Appearance </b>
Like I said this is the first year of the new look for the Camaro and it still looks great today. It is sleek and sits low to the ground for the sports car appearance. 

This is the year they added the new spoiler that has air under it from the trunk instead of the old NASCAR style spoiler. The front end and back end both have a newer and sportier look than the previous years.  

It is a sharp looking sports car!

<b>The Ride  </b>
The ride is better than most compact type cars but a little less than a mid size car. Since it sits so low to the ground it has a tendency of picking up a little more road noise and bumps.

The Camaro handles great, it has plenty of get up and go and will handle a curve at a faster speed than most cars will. 

<b>My Complaints </b>
My only complaint with the Camaro is when you are changing your own oil. The Camaro sits so low to the ground that you have to jack it up to get under it to take out the oil plug and filter. Then you have to jack it back down so it will drain the oil properly and then jack it up again to put the oil plug and new oil filter in.

The rear seats are not very comfortable and are made for a small person or child.

<b>Problems </b>
Since March of 1995 we have had only two problems.

1.	The speedometer quit after the Camaro was a couple of months old. Chevrolet fixed it and there have been no problems since.

2.	Two years ago the alternator gave out and I replaced it with a rebuilt one, no problems since then.

<b>Overall </b>
Overall the Camaro has been a very dependable and reliable car. We have been test-driving several other makes and models but as for now we still have the Camaro.

Our Camaro has 49,876 miles on it and will last for a long time to come.

I have done regular maintenance on it like the oil and filter changes and I replaced the spark plugs once, Beside the two complaints I listed above, the Camaro has been a maintenance free car. 

My wife and I are middle aged people and when you drive the Camaro, you feel your youth coming back.

I have no regrets on this automobile, I highly recommend the Chevrolet Camaro!
