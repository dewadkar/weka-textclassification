            We purchased a used 1994 Dodge Caravan last year.  I was hesitant at first because the vehicle already had 80,000+ miles... high mileage for the year.  But because we were able to purchase a 3-year/36,000 mile warranty along with it for a reasonable price, we went for it.  I am not disappointed one bit!

I don't put on many miles during regular everyday use... just trips to the store and out and about for family.  We have taken the van on a 600 mile road trip as well.  Aside from an initial inspection which required a $150 fix, we have had no expenses incurred other than regular maintenance and gas.  This van has been reliable.  It starts easily in cold weather and has never given out on us.  

Our van is a V-4 (unfortunately).  That was one of the down sides of this purchase.  I would recommend the V-6.  The only time I notice a lag is on hills though.  As a people mover, the V-4 is adequate.  The seats in this van are very comfortable.  The two rear seats can be removed in order to transport cargo, though they are heavy.  When we took our trip, we removed the middle seat and moved the back seat up to the middle position to give us more room in the back for luggage.  I like the fact that the seats are interchangeable like that.  This van is safe, with anti-lock brakes.  I feel confident driving in snow and rain.  

As far as maneuverability and comfort while driving, my Caravan is tops.  It drives so smooth.  My dad borrowed it one day and was so impressed.  He said it was the easiest, smoothest driving vehicle he had ever been in.  

While we didn't have the options to get all of the bells and whistles, the standard features are nice.  I also like the built in cup holders and storage bins in the back seats.  I do wish we had the dual sliding doors in this model though.  The gas mileage leaves a bit to be desired.  We currently get about 18mpg city and about 25 highway.  I have had new cars before and this Caravan is better.  This is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  Dependable quality here!<br><br>
