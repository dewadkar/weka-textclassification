            Samsung�s Digimax 800K is a great little camera for those wanting to play around with digital images but is more suited to complete beginners rather than expert photographers. 

It�s priced fairly reasonably compared to others and the first thing I noticed about it, was how light and plasticky it seems to be. The camera comes in a small silver plastic body and is incredibly lightweight, less than 200g. At first appearance, you would be forgiven for thinking this was a toy! 

Features are limited but you can get some excellent photographs with this one, especially outdoors in natural light. The flash gives pleasing indoor photography results but these can sometimes be a little distorted if battery power is weak. It runs using 2 AA type batteries and be warned, these go flat in a very short space of time and your photographs will suffer if the batteries are not fresh. So rechargeable batteries are an absolute must! There are three separate flash features included, automatic flesh detector, fill in flash or cancel flash altogether. Note, there is no LCD display with this camera so you cannot view your images until you have uploaded them. 

The camera has a macro photography feature, but as yet, I�ve not really had very impressive results, pictures seem to be very blurred nine times out of then. It also has a useful timer feature that is great if you want to be in the shot yourself. 

The camera has a mere 2Meg SmartMedia memory card that is quite restrictive, allowing you about 16 standard resolution photographs before it is full. However, you can purchase higher memory cards at a price! A 16Meg card will allow you to take and store over 200 photographs. 

It�s not the fastest camera though, expect to wait a good few seconds between taking photographs to allow the camera to reset itself. The flash also takes a good time to �warm up�.

Uploading your pictures to the PC is very straightforward and takes just seconds for each one. 

Accessories consist of a snug carry pouch, handle strap, batteries, 2MB memory card, serial cable to connect to your PC, MGI Photosuite software and TWAIN driver disc. You can also purchase an AC adaptor as an extra. Plus of course, you do get an instruction manual too, not too in depth but does explain the features in a straightforward way. 

All in all, it�s a good basic little camera, and ideal for those wanting to start with something simple before laying out big money on a big featured camera. It�s a simple point and click camera that anybody can use but you will need a very steady hand with this one, the slightest tremble and your pictures will be blurred! It�s probably one of the most basic digital cameras available, but this is reflected in the price and is an excellent choice for the beginner.
