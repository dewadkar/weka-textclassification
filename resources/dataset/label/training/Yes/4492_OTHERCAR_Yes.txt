            I have had several Mercedes passenger cars and Mini-Vans when kids left home time to consolidate.  The ML320 was purchase 1 1/2 years ago.  Absolutely, the best decision to serve the multiple use purposes.  It is a good human and mechanical engineering result, workable mileage, and a pleasure to drive on long trips as well as in town.  Some of the colors are not attractive for the vehicle.  I chose dark green and tan - works well.  The leather interior and CD player are a plus and well integrated.
10,000 mile service interval is also a plus.<br><br>
