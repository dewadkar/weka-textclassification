            The Mercedes SLK 230 is the ultimate year round sports car. From the day I drove it off the lot, I have seen jaws drop when the top folds into the trunk. Countless times people have gone out of their way to make a comment on my car.

The hard top, rear window defroster and heated seats (optional) all combine to make this car a pleasure to drive in the winter, while the convertible and sports handling make it a blast in the summer.

The interior is remarkably roomy for a roadster (more room than the BMW Z3 or Porsche Boxster). I have no problems at 6'0, 225 lbs. The styling, while admittedly not for everyone has a retro feel that is unique and cries out to be noticed. The trunk has ample room when the top is up (my golf clubs fit just fine, as does my guitar) and enough for an overnight bag when the top is down.

This is not a car for families, as there is no back seat whatsoever, but for a single guy in a four-season city, there is no other choice.

The wind deflector had little effect in my opinion, and blocked visibility more than it was worth.<br><br>
