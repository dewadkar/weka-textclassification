            We bought our 99 F350 crew cab, dually, because of it's size, and good looks. I love my truck. I get about 12 miles per gallon city driving. We bought our truck to pull a horse trailer. It has so much power. Ours is a 4 wheel drive 5 speed. I get compliments on my truck all the time. It handles well in the snow. We love the room inside, and out. There is nothing that i hate about my truck, except, it's hard to park in the city, because of it's size.
Driving this truck is fun and easy, this is our first dually, and it was easy getting used to it. I am only 4ft 10,female; and i have no problem driving such a large truck. I would recommend buying this truck because of it's power, easy handling,and overall satisfaction. I love my truck!

I ADDED THIS LATER....WE HAVE HAD TO REPLACE OUR ROTORS THREE TIMES SINCE WE'VE GOTTEN THIS TRUCK, ANYONE ELSE WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS????<br><br>
