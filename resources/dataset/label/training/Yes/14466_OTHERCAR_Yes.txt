            I bought this car used with 21,000 miles on it when I started having problems with my Lincoln.  This is a very fun car to drive and appears to be very well put together.  I average about 28 to 30 miles per gallon, maybe a little low, but I am satisfied with it.  This vehicle handles very well on the freeway and on the back roads as well.  Little road noise and comfortable seats.  It is not a Lincoln, but for the price and the class, I would rate it five stars.  The stereo in the car is the basic AM/FM/Cassette unit.  The reception is good and the sound adequate, could use higher quality speakers.  I especially like the fact that you cannot leave the key in the ignition and lock yourself out of the vehicle.
