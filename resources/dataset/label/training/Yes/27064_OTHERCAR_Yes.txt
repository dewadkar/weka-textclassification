            Great as a 2nd car! Bought as a 3rd car but with gas prices became primary commuter. The SOHC VTEC engine is the easiest to live with, 33 mpg in town and 37 on the road with regular unleaded. Very little need for AC with power rear window. Stereo needs more bass & power. Plenty of power! Can drive around all day long and never exceed 4000 rpm, but hold on if you go past that...at 4500 kicks hard enough that passenger can't reach for the stereo! Most comfortable seats I have ever sat in! Getting in and out is a little harder than my Miata was, due to, I believe, the door not being located far enough forward, but much more room once you are inside. Nice big trunk, that can still be used with the top in storage. Needs an accessible cup holder! Parts are a little pricey, but don't need to be replaced often. Door handles break a lot. A few rattles are likely from the targa top. Samba Green is the color to have, since the darker colors make you invisible to all traffic.
