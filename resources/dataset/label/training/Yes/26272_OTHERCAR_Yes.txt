            I won't go through the history of the Civic, or its place in modern driving with you. We have all seen the popularity of the Civic grow with each passing year, as shown by looking out your car's windshield and seeing so many of them on the road. The 2000 Civic is as durable as any other year I have yet had the pleasure of driving, with smooth handling and ride.

In one review, I noticed mention of tire squeal in turns, and have to say that I haven't noticed it myself. My girlfriend's Civic handles beautifully in the corners and sharp turns in our area, and has yet to produce tire squeal. This may be a problem indicative to the type of road surface in your area, and not a design flaw. The stopping power of the Civic is in some question, and is variant upon weather, which in South Florida, is nasty in the rain. (Then again, in the rain, what does stop well?)

For speed and performance, the Civic, even the sportier models, is an economy car, not a sports car. If you are looking for true speed, get the V6 equipped Accord, or better yet, the Prelude, depending on you passenger and cargo needs. Honda does wonders with a 1.5L 4 cylinder, but there is only so much so small and engine can do. If your need is for speed, you're looking in the wrong place. If you want reliability, comfort, economy and safety, at a reasonable price, then the Civic was made for you...<br><br>
