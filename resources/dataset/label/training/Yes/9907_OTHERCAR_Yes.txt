            We just traded in our 1999 mercury mystique because it was too expensive. The 1993 mazda mx3 is the vehicle we purchased it for. We miss all of the room in our other car....but this is excellent on gas.I think it will grow on us. It is black outside and black inside also. It is a stick shift.It drives smooth.I think we will be very happy with this purchase.It is a very small car.It handles nicely and drives smooth.Although we like this car, we will deeply miss our other one.It had taken us to places no other car had taken us.... :)!!

The only thing i dont like is the seatbelt that is attached to the door that moves when i open the door. It is a choker!
