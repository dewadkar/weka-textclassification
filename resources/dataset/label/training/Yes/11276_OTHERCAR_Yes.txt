            I researched/compared and drove a Subaru Forester, Ford Explorer (Eddie Bauer), Mitsubishi Montero and Nissan Xterra.  Even though I liked the looks of the others much more than the Forester, it beat them all in terms of mileage, price, and handling.  Outside of the Montero, the others drove like a truck, because... they're also more likely to be used for that 'off-road' purpose.  I've only had two problems.  Within the first month, the 'Check Engine' light wouldn't go away.  Turned out to be a fault sensor.  Then twice I've had CDs stuck in the CD player.  Sort of a pain, but also pushed me to install a Kenwood eXcelon 815 which improves my driving experience 600%.  I moved from standard city driving in St. Louis to Germany recently and now my only complaint is that the governor kicks in at 110 mph.  One wouldn't think this could ever be a 'problem' in the U.S., but in Germany, hitting 110 mph occurs 3-5 times every half hour on the autobahn.  I like the pick up, cornering, low-center of gravity.  I like the front grill look w/the outdoor-rugged lip option (I ended up getting almost every option possible).  The Yokahama wheels and rims have done great so far (even travelling 105 mph 1-2 hours, 2-3 times a week).  I miss not having a moonroof.  Though, it's an option for the 2001 model, I the new model looks weaker w/it's monochrome paint scheme.  In a week I should have new interior aluminum brush pieces
from Postert (http://www.postert.de) and will then start a project to install a Trident flatscreen monitor in the center console for GPS/mp3 purposes...  All-in-all, I might have liked having a 'cooler' looking car/mini-SUV, but the mileage and the price (and leg room) sold me on the Forester.<br><br>
