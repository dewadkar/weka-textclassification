              This is the best digital camera I have ever tested or owned.  Even though it has been discontinued and replaced with the HP C200 (Which I believe seem a lot alike), I still give this one high recommends and if you are looking for a used camera, or are lucky enough to come across one new, grab it as soon as you can.

  I have tested and had many cameras both older ones such as the C20 and newer ones, yet this camera remains my favorite.  It comes with an 8MB card, which holds 17 hi-res pictures.  And can easily be upgraded with larger cards for little money.  

  The picture quality is excellent.  Colors are extremely natural, and are more lifelike than many cameras I have had at 3-4X the price.  It is a 1 megapixel camera, so not quite as high resolution as the newer ones, but still takes pictures comparable to them.  And although it doesn't come with an optical zoom, it has a 2X digital zoom built-in.  It also has an automatic focus for really close blowups, which takes extremely good pictures even while moving.  Other options include red-eye reduction, timer, and TV video outs with slide show capabilities.

  The camera is extremely easy to use (Even my mother picked it up and started using it without any difficulty).  Just point and click.

  As far as problems with this camera, I can just think of two.  The first  I believe is the same with most cameras in that expecially if you use the LCD display is the ability to render a new set of batteries useless in a matter of minutes.  If you are thinking about buying a digital camera, I recommend you buy Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries, as these seem to last even longer than the disposable ones and like I said this thing eats batteries.

  The other problem with this camera is the lack of a USB port.  Sending a full set of pictures via serial port takes a long time, probably in the range of 10-20 minutes.

  So to conclude if you are out looking for for a new digital camera I recommend you look for a C20, or it new sister the C200.  HP really has what it takes to make a camera with a great picture and at reasonably prices<br><br>
