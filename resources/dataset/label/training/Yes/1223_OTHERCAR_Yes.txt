            I bought this vehicle about a year ago with 30,000 original miles on it.  It had been parked most of its life due to the fact that the factory fuel injection had a short in the wiring.  I replaced the injection with a carb setup from an earlier Yugo, and rewired the car, and now have a VERY reliable car with only 40,000 miles on it for less than $1,000.  That's a great deal, in my opinion.  The little cars are otherwise mechanically sound, and from what I have learned about them from other owners, the fuel injection setups are usually very reliable (it seems mine was an exception to the rule).  

The Yugo is a fun car to drive- it handles reasonably well from the factory, and the addition of some Fiat racing parts can make a HUGE difference in how it performs.  In all, I'd recommend it to anyone else who wants a car that is fun to drive, cheap to drive, and has that unique European style that resembles a 1990's version of the English Mini, or the original (the REAL) VW Beetle.  But if you get one, you should be somewhat handy with a wrench, since the cars are essentially Fiats and there aren't any Fiat (or Yugo) dealerships around anymore for having it serviced.  However, parts are still available through either Apple Motors or Orion Motors (both on the web) and any local import shop that knows Italian cars should be capable of working on it.  

As far as the Yugo jokes are concerned, most of them are funny, but most of them are NOT based in the reality of owning one of these little cars.  They DO require that you keep them maintained PROPERLY, like any other Italian car does.  But if you will do that, they are very reliable.  <br><br>
