            I owned a 1991 Acura Legend L for 120,000 miles.  I traded it in Sept, 1999 for the 1999 TL sedan.  It had more new features, virtually no &quot;extras to buy&quot; and was $2,000 less than I paid for the Legend!  The ride is more powerful, love the built-in garage door opener and the full featured Bose music system, tilting sun roof, etc.  Mileage seems to be about 1 mpg less, but power is greatly improved.  Acura is great for at least the 1st 70,000 miles.  Then your repair costs each quarter come in around what payments for a new one would be.  That's your choice.  However, trade-in value is very good.  I got $5,300 for my 1991 on a trade.<br><br>
