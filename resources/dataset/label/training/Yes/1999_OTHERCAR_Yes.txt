            This is my first new vehicle that I purchased and I must say it's great.  The GXE model starts at low $20 thousands, the engine is POWERFUL and it can haul ASS.  My first car was a 1994 Acura Integra GS-R (170 hp, 4 cylinder)and the Maxima's v-6 EASILY kicks its ass in every category.  The GS-R has a little bit better handling because of its standard v-rated tires and better suspension due to it being a sports car but that's the only category it can even compete with the Maxima.  It has an extremely quiet engine that delivers 222 hp with a LOT of torque. I love just about everything about this vehicle. If you want a powerful, quick and affordable semi-luxury car, get the Maxima.  It is almost the same car as the Infinity I30, but less luxurious and perfect for younger drivers with a budget.  I'm a college student and I'm more than happy with what I bought for the money.  It has a huge interior and the ride is smooth.  I got a black GXE with rims, a spoiler, and a 6-disc cd changer.  <br><br>
