            Hyundai Elantra Wagon....
I bought a 2000 Hyundai Elantra Wagon at the beginning of the year. The ability to haul stuff (like hot water heater in the box) is a great advantage. My previous car was a 6 cylinder 4-door Plymouth Acclaim.  The Elantra wagon has 4 cylinders.  Although I sacrifice the pick-up of a 6 cylinder, the gas mileage makes up for the aggravation (when you want to go, you want to go).  I�m disappointed with the overall headroom. I�m 5 foot 6 inches (probably shorter that the average person) and am constantly hit my head on the roof of the car when I adjust myself getting in or out.  If I put anything in the visor, like letters to be mailed, it decreases the head room more.  I like the fact that the certain alarm system features can be custom programmed, by the user, to his or her preference.  Since I�m technically oriented, I feel that it�s easier to program then a VCR.  However, I wish that the auto-window-down feature would have it�s own switch.  There are many times I want the window to go down just a tad.  With this feature, it is hard to double click the window button to stop exactly where you wish, especially for right handed people. 
Another inconvenience, is the cup holders.  Although the two cup holders hold the standard size and slightly smaller size cups or cans very well, the position of the holder is in line with the shift stick.  If there is a cup with a handle, made for these type of holders, the stick will hit the cup handle and the cup will hit the radio buttons when placing it in park.  Worse case is that your fingers will be smashed with the cup between the radio and the parking sick, making it harder to place in Park!
I also had problems with the remote keyless entry.  When temperatures are freezing, although the alarm system functions normally, the keyless entry does not always lock or unlock the doors.  This problem is very hard to troubleshoot since it�s an intermittent and the mechanics work in doors above freezing.

I also had a clicking noise come form the rear tire (possibly the passenger side).  At low speed breaking, I heard a clicking noise where the frequency is proportional to the rotational speed of the tire.  After taking the car to two dealers the problem did not totally disappear.  Unfortunately, I had noticed some of fabric on the passenger seat is coming unstitched along the back seam, a few weeks after I had it in for service.

   One major disappointment with the Elantra, is that there is one key that is used for all locks (door, trunk and glove box).  If you ever give your key to a valet parker, HOW SAFE are those personal things you like to keep in the car with you?

In closing, owning the Elantra Wagon after 5 months, I do enjoy the ride, handling and short turning radius.  I like the keyless entry and alarm system along with the warrantee and roadside assistance.  I would like to have a bit more power.  I do recommend this wagon if you are on a budget.  As in most cases, you only get what you pay for.
