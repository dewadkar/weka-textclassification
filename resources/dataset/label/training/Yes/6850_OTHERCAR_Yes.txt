            The Hyundai Elantra has to be the best car value out there.  For the budget-minded consumer, the price and warranty make this car the best choice out there.

Let's start by looking at the cost of the car.  My wife and I purchased this car to replace her car, which was often visiting the mechanic.  We looked around at different cars and found that most new cars were out of our price range.  Generally, new cars were starting at a base price of 15-16K.  The Hyundai Elantra had a base price of around 11,500. The warranty which Hyundai offers is at the tops any other car manufacturer's warranty.  

Driving the car is an absolute dream.  The car is very quiet, even on the highway.  For a smaller car, it has great pickup.  The control panels are easy to read, the seat is comfortable on long drives, the trunk has plenty of room, and there is enough room in both the front and back seats of the car. 

My only dislikes on the car are the brakes and the turn signal.  The brakes are good for normal driving, but at higher speeds, the brakes don't bite as much as they should.  I would recommend the 4-wheel ABS brakes (a feature I don't have).  My other complaint is that the turn signal lever is too short.  At times, I have trouble finding it without taking my eyes off the road.  

The value and the drive of this car make the best value for the price conscious consumer.<br><br>
