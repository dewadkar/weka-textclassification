            When I first shut the driver's side door, I was impressed.  This SUV is solid, sturdy as a little pony, and a lot more willing.  I test drove both the Toyota RAV4 and the KIA Sportage before I drove the Grand Vitara  - and was not impressed.  To me, they both felt underpowered going up moderate inclines.
     My Grand Vitara, even with automatic transmission, makes me feel as if there is power to spare.  The Suzuki has a number of well thought out features I love - such as the storage boxes under each front seat, map pockets in all four doors, and (wow!) extensions on the sun visors to help block even more sun.   It's also got a very decent amount of room in the rear with the back seats folded down.   
     What's NOT to like about the Grand Vitara? Right off hand, I'd say the only thing needing improvement is gas mileage....I'd like to see at least 20 mpg.  Other than that, it is a great vehicle,
fairly priced, with solid construction and lots and lots and lots of extra features.  And - last but not least...plenty of headroom.<br><br>
