            Intro/Engine:

This car was purchased brand new from the dealer by my Grandfather in 1986 for $26,542. Quite a bit of money back in the 80s, but man this car was worth every penny. A great looking car. This car also has very decent miles on it, my grandparents drove from Illinois to California and then to Arizona, and then to Florida, and back to Illinois several times.(I believe the odometer is at 51,200) This car has lines, and it knows how to use them. Starting with the front, the car sharply extends a few feet back to the windshield. The hood is elongated this far because of the massive 5.0 Liter Ford V8. This is a blessing and a bane. The blessing is in the fact that you get monster power to haul this elegant car around. The downside is that usually fuel economy is not the greatest and that if you are under 21 or 22, your insurance may charge you more because of the number of cylinders. Because of the way that Lincoln managed to shove in that engine, and all the other stuff, its kind of hard to work on unless you know exactly what you are doing. I suggest taking it to a good mechanic, who has experience. Acceleration is not as evident when first running the car for about 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the V8 has warmed up and is ready to go. A slight push of the accelerator, and the Lincoln simply goes. It does not have sports car acceleration, but when you are going, you know you are. Because this was an 80s car, the speedometer only goes to about 85 miles per hour. I would imagine that truly opened up, this car could hit at least 115 or 120. There is nothing like the power of a V8, especially in a luxury car.

Design:

Lincoln truly came up with a winner in the design department. Many an onlooker would say that it is just another big 80s luxury car that looked like a giant rectangle. Those people need to see the car up close. The hood has graceful crests on the front over where the turn signals meet the headlights. The car has a decent amount of chrome on it too. The color on this one is a red wine/maroon/dark deep red. Moving to the interior, this one has red leather, complete with the Lincoln logo stitched into the headrests of each of the four seats. Some, like this one, have the power packages, for power doors to power seats to power windows. Starting at the helm of the Land Yacht, the driver is faced with a beautiful instrument panel. Everything in analog, and this one has a mechanical clock. The weight of the shift lever, turn signals, and windshield wiper control, are all made out of metal, and polished to a beautiful shine. This car also has a retractable radio antenna, which is controlled in the center of the console, by a switch. The radio has a cassette player, and comes with Dolby Sound.(I also made a tape of the song from the new Lincoln Navigator commercial, play it every time the car starts) Sliding over one seat, the passenger in the front seat can open the trunk from the glove box. Dropping back a seat, into the rear seat of the car, it is incredible. The red leather basically conforms and swallows whoever sits in it. Throughout the whole car, there is leg-room galore.(I'm 6'3" and have no problems sitting anywhere in the car.) The floor is of carpeting, and very nice. This car was also around when the smokers packages were just standard. With the exception of the driver, every door has its own personal ashtray and cigarette/cigar lighter, powered by the cars battery. This car has absolutely the best interior I have ever seen or felt.

General Stuff/Exit:

This cars trunk is very large, and fairly deep. It is operated by the button in the glove box, or by a key that is different from the ignition/door lock unlock key. The car also has a numbered keypad on the drivers side door, with a special code to unlock the doors. The only major problem with the car is that my grandfather and I once hit a massive pothole that knocked out the air conditioner. It cost an arm and a leg to fix, but we were glad it was fixed. The 1986 Lincoln Town Car is an incredible piece of raw power, art, style, and grace all combined together.
