                    I am the proud owner of a 2002 Ford Excursion Limited Ultimate with the Powerstroke Diesel (PSD).  I am very pleased with the vehicle.  Several factors led me to buy this vehicle.  First, I wanted something with a third row seat, but with usable luggage space behind the third row seat.  I also wanted the ability to hang a rack of clothes behind the third seat for when we travel.  I also wanted a vehicle with front leg and foot room.  I am 6'5" with size 14 feet.  If I have no place to put my feet, I won't buy the vehicle.  With these criteria in mind, the Excursion was the only vehicle that fit all my needs.  I also considered a GMC Yukon XL, but it didn't have the foot room (GM has put a box of some kind right where my foot wants to go) or the room to hang clothes behind the rear seat.  A full size van fit all the criteria except foot room.  

        I also tow.  I have a small trailer now, but will probably upgrade.  I have owned two Suburbans in the past, but they were very limited when it came to towing a large travel trailer.  The Excursion will tow any of the models I am interested in with ease.

        I got the Excursion with the PSD.  Very good engine.  It provides ample power, with excellent fuel economy.  Better than my Suburban, with much more capability.  Yes, it is a bit louder than a gas engine, but not obtrusively so.  I also got a 4x4 (hard to find in South Carolina).  I am in the military and could find myself in Wisconsin tomorrow, where I'll need the 4x4 capability.

        The seats are excellent, the best I've ever had in any vehicle.  I got the second row captain's chairs with the rear seat entertainment system.  The entertainment system has a small screen, but it's very sharp and clear.  The sound from the stereo and entertainment system is excellent, if just a tad underpowered.  Interior fit and finish is excellent, easily the equal of most luxury cars I have owned or ridden in.

        Driving the Excursion is very easy.  The vehicle handles very well for an almost 4 ton vehicle.  True, it's no sports car, but very few sports cars can fit a family of five plus luggage and pull a large trailer.  The Excursion is a truck, for Pete's sake, and handles well when you consider this.  Parking can be a chore if you choose tight spaces.  I just park a bit further away, and have very few problems.  The back up warning system is a godsend for parking.  Paint is very attractive and glossy, I get a lot of compliments.  Mine is Mineral Gray Metallic, but looks more tan than gray to me!  

        Gripes about the vehicle?  My previous vehicle was a Chevy Astro, which had tons of cubby holes and places to store things especially in the rear passenger area.  The Excursion lacks these handy cubbies.  Also, with the captain's chairs and rear entertainment system, there are no cupholders for the second row seats.  The second row captain's chairs, although comfortable, are locked in place with no fore and aft adjustment.  Also, why no head rests on the third seat?  I would be willing to trade a bit of rear visibility for whiplash protection for my third seat passengers.  Finally, washing this truck is a bit of work.  I'm 6'5" and need a stepstool.

        Overall, great vehicle that fits all my needs.
