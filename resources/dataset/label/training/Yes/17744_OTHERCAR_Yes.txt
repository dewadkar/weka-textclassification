            I just bought a 2000 Saturn used from a little private dealership and would do it again and again. I was lucky it was listed for 8K and was on sale for 7K and talked him down to 5600 for a 2000 with only 36K miles on it!!!! It has all the basic features, no compact disk player, no auto locks, and crank windows. The main importance though for me was reliable car and gas mileage. I drive 28.4 miles to work one way so having a car that averages 40 miles on the hwy was a real money saver for me. Also it has a lot of zip with a manual. Nice smooth ride, comfortable seats, great car if you are only 5'5" like me. Good sound system, you can program an equalized sound to each radio station. Huge trunk great for shopping. Safety is a plus with this car as well. has 3 tether locks for 3 child seats. I only have one so it works great. The seat belts are adjustable in the front for people who are taller so the neck does get bothered. If you are looking for a car that is affordable and low maintenance and safe. Get this car the added bonus is you only pump gas every 2 weeks!
