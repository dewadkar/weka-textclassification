            The Powershot S30 from Canon is a very stylish camera, however it still has the wealth of photographic controls you would come to expect from Canon. The S30 offers a decent 3.2 megapixel resolution, as opposed to it's 4-megapixel sister S-40 model. However both cameras are virtually identical. The S-30 offers a great array of different shooting modes along with superior photo output which is high in detail.
 
The S30 is has a nice modern spiffy built to it. It weighs  just 11.1 ounces ( including battery and media card). It's body has a nice all brushed metal look to it. The camera's controls are accessed easily  via buttons and dials. The controls on the 1.8 LCD are also very multifunctional and make it easy access different features of the camera. The only negative part to this camera was that if you have it mounted on a tripod it's almost impossible to access the battery compartment or compact flash area. The battery life is a little weak also, I burnt  through the rechargeable battery more rapidly than I would have liked. A compact charger does come with the camera and it takes a good solid hour or more to recharge an empty battery. It also doesn't come a with carrying case, which might be annoying if you don't want your camera to get damaged.

The performance of the S30 is also great. It has a 3X retractable zoom lense. The autofocusing on this camera is quick, and has very little shutter lag. The only negative quality of the Canon S30 is that you can't add accessory lenses to it. What I also liked was that the S30 supports a RAW file format which is more flexible than very large uncompressed TIFF files that you see on other cameras.

 The images on  Canon S30 images are also great. Automatic white balance settings were exceptional and extremely reliable. Colors from this camera are well saturated and have very low amounts of noise (even in low levels of light). Image detail and dynamic ranges were excellent, even in pictures with strong contrasts.

Overall, the Powershot S30 is solid performance camera  with a reasonable 500-599$ price range. It's design will appeal to advanced photo enthusiasts and novices, that are looking for  a small compact camera. However, if you are looking to print  images larger than 8X 10 frequently, consider getting the Canon S-40 which is the next model
