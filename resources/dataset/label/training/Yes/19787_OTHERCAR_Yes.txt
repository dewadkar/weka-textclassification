            My previous vehicle was a '91 Golf, and that one gave me grief (brakes, clutch and cooling sys.). So why did I stick with Golf? The dealer gave me too good a deal. It's a '96, and I LOVE it. A solid, solid feel and the cornering and handling reminds me of a '63 Porsche I once owned. Not only that, but there have been no mechanical problems � unlike the '91. It gives me decent mileage (29-30 mpg), combined city and freeway driving, and 34 mpg on a trip to Oregon up I-5 (650 miles). That trip, incidentally, proved the cooling system was a good one, and on chilly mornings at home, the heating was equally effective. The only glitch with this car was a failed battery after 30,000 miles. To sum up: God! I love this car � and I've had quite a few.<br><br>
