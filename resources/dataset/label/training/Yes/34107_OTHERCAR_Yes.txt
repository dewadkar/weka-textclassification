            Good car, nice quality. We've now got 100K on it and still no major problems.  The brake calipers tend to hang if you let the brakes go low, so watch out ($$$, but my wife is heavy on the brakes).  This is my wife's car so if I don't watch it maitenance is not done on a regular basis - despite this no problems.  It has decent power and has taken us into the mountains many times without a loss of power or overheating.  The interior (cloth) is still holding strong as the day it was bought.  The stereo has had some problems but it is a standard DIN deck and is easily replaced or worked on.  This is the EASIEST oil change I have ever encountered - you only go under the car to remove and refit the drain plug, everything else can be done up top.  It handles nicely for a passenger vehicle and is comfy even on long trips.  The back seat isn't even too bad for a coupe, but I don't recommend it for adults.  I guess the only major problems are changing the rear tail-lights (real pain when they burn out) and the parking brake lever (easily slips, light sometimes stays on). It gets average fuel economy (avg 28 mpg) which is not outstanding, but not terrible either.  These are not major problems though and the car stands up well - if I can recommend something after 100,000 miles, it says something.<br><br>
