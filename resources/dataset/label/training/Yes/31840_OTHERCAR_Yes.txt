            This is my second honda...after getting married I wanted something with 2 doors.I first looked at the Mazda Protoge but found it to be less than  a great buy.The protoge felt very weak and noisy...its appearence on the road had the rental car look...(small). After a visit to my local VA dealer I looked at the civic EX 4 dr. This car looks much better than the older version of the civic.After a spin around the block I fell in love. This car is very sporty and feels sturdy. After having the car for nine months now I have a few pet peeves. The car is sometimes slow to accelerate ...and you do get a few squeeks here and there.The CD player also skips once in a while. I love the keyless entry but a trunk release would have been nice. All the insturments are close at hand and easy to read. The trunk has more space than what I have seen on any compact sedan.
The A/C in this vehicle is not very good (I have not had it checked yet).The seats are also a little hard. as far as gas ..I have sometimes got 29 miles per gallon...I do not know if this is good or bad. On the highway this car is pretty quite and the smooth. If you are buying this car make sure to get the EX ..the Ex has the V-Tech engine and gets you a sunroof ,keyless entry and much much more.Also on the Ex you get color key mirrors and door trim.I also looked at the corola but it looked dull and boring. This card looks a lot more sporty and fun. For 2001 honda is getting a new look for the civic (about time). The new body looks great and more wider. If you are looking for a fun car under $20,000..this is it. <br><br>
