            I was pleased to own a 1998 Bravada for nearly a year before trading down to a Dakota Pick-up.  This was the �best� automobile I have owned.  Previous vehicles had always been automobiles Grand Am and the like.  Yes, I am a General Motors brat, my father worked and retired from GM after 30 years.  I had one SUV in the past before this and old 88 GMC Jimmy.  Well from my first test drive until returning it to the dealer two years later to trade it, I was more than satisfied.  The all wheel drive was key in handling and being from St. Louis, where I was located during the majority of my ownership, handling is key.  Unlike four-wheel drive that seems to grab and lock all wheel drive does provide excellent maneuvering in snow and on ice.  I purchased the vehicle from a dealership that leases them, so was able to get a top of the line with great value and low miles.  My recommendation is to always look for good used or previously leased vehicles.  I was able to purchase the vehicle well under NADA Blue book value. 

The only low point was gas mileage, but well worth the extra few gallons a week. I drove it in the city to and from work. The four doors were a plus when you had a group going out or to lunch.  Five people seat with comfort in the Bravada.  Top of the line SUV for the money. 


The new as well as this model had full instrument panels that provide excellent control and management of the automobile.  Full leather with added features of rear windshield wiper, built in holders for garage door opener, sunglasses and CD case holders only added to the luxury of this automobile. The tinted windows helped control heat that would of occurred due to the black interior.
