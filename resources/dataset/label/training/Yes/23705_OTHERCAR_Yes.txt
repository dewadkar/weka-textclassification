            I was looking for a used car to replace my beloved '86 Toyota Supra. I was interested in something quick and customizable, and so looked at several Mitsubishi Eclipses, BMW 3-series, and numerous other sport coupes and sedans. I saw a '93 ES, though, and loved it. 

The ride is very much Camry - that is to say, dependable, smooth, and satisfying. But, when you combine it with the luxury of the Lexus line and get the Coach leather seats and ultra-refined sound system (not to mention dozens of other goodies), it becomes a very classy package. Even eight years old, this car can still get stares.

I would suggest this car to anyone who can use the space that a four-door sedan provides and is looking to spend a little more on a used car. However, if you need utility above luxury, consider a similar Camry or Accord. <br><br>
