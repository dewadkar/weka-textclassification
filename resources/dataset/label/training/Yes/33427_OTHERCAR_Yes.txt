            In my opinion the 1999 Volkswagon Jetta was a very good buy.  For the amount of vehicle you get for what you pay it just seems to make economical sence.  I love the european feel to the car.  The styling and quality of the car makes it fun to drive and makes it a car to be proud of owning.  The handling is superb.  Dealing with Volkswagon corporation has been a pleasant experience also.  After having several problems with the local dealer the Volkswagon corporation resolved those problems effectively and made follow up calls.  
We have a a few minor problems with the car though.  There seems to have been a manufacturing problem with the moon roof which took about 2 months to finally get correctly fixed and we are currently having a problem with the locking fuel door.  
The Jetta gives you the feel of a sports car performance while still having the convienence of a four door sedan.  There is plenty of storage room in the trunk and the ride is comfortable for four adults.  I would recommend the Jetta to anyone currently shopping for a new car.<br><br>
