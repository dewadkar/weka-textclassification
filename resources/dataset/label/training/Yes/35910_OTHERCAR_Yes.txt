            Ok first off I bought this remarkable piece of equipment because I have the need... the need for speed. And handling, and comfort, and beauty. I seriously don't understand why people say its a car built for small people, because I'm 6'0 200lbs and she fits me like a glove. Not to mention how comfortable it is -- the armrests are actually useful! Imagine that, ergonomics, performance, and looks. What else do you need? Theres something about the cloth bucket seats in my model too... they keep my butt planted firmly in the center of the seat and they're soooo comfortable (and very, very adjustable).

I can't honestly say I hate anything about it except maybe the cost of labor if there's ever a serious case of something breaking down. My clutch went out at about 96,000 miles which isn't bad considering how much this car tempts you to spin the wheels... (I was going to upgrade to an ACT street clutch anyway).

Driving the Duece is like nothing else I've ever experienced in my life, except maybe my bike. I'm used to being able to get to any speed quickly because of the years I've spent on motorcycles, and when I got into the '2, it was no different. 90mph almost feels like 'cruising speed' in this thing (on a closed course with a professional driver -- yeah ;). Also the car is very sound, and its quiet as far as rattles/squeaks go, but if you get the turbo (you _must_ get the turbo) you'll get an almost sexual engine growl (Well as growly as a 4 cylinder can get).

This car is ideal for the young punk like myself that wants to live fast (carefully too, thanks to the airbag), the old dude going through his midlife crisis, or the commuter (Since it's a two seater you can hit the carpool lanes with only two people --[some areas around here carpool = 3 people, not 2]).

This car is definitely not for the family man (that's who my car used to belong to, before he had kids and had to sell it), and its not for someone who wants to be sloppy at high speeds. Mid-engine cars require a little bit of know-how to handle correctly in the high-speed twisties because of the risk of upsetting the balance. And when I say high speed I mean high speed, if you stay in a relatively legal speed you don't have to worry. The typical highschooler or college student might want to look elsewhere because insurance will almost always get you ($1800/yr - full coverage - AAA [I'm 20 yrs. old]).

On a side note, though I selected 'Very roomy, even in back' in the 'Roominess' topic, take out the 'even in back' part because its only a 2-seater (I refuse to say it was built for tiny people, because that's just not true. The epinion folks might want to consider adding another selection there).

In closing, get the turbo and you should be happy. Also if you want a bit more of a sporty model, get the pre-1993 models as the '91's and '92's have a few slightly different suspension parts than the '93 and up. Some call the 91-92's tailhappy, but if you know how to drive, you'll love it. And some of you out there might even want the tailhappyness (I know you're out there because I can't be the only one :).<br><br>
