            I have owned the fd-81 for over 1 year now and it still is an amazing camera..The optics are top notch, the floppy is a great but old idea.
This camera is bulky but durable, the rechargeable battery is great. Always get close to your subjects, portraits are nice, group shots of more than 3 people are more than this camera can handle. the low light and closeup mode are fantastic, the flash tends to overexpose the photos a lot...Wish they would make the high resolution model with a zip drive...

best tips, get close to subject, don't use the flash, save everything at the highest resolution and bring lots of floppies...

Update: Jan. 2002

Ok, I have upgraded to the Olympus E-10, but the Sony still gets used for web work..Everything works, and the pics taken have a nice softness and warmth to them. If you just want to take pics. for the web, or your pet, this is a wonderful starter camera system..At only 1.3 megapixels, it will print nice 5x7's, but nothing larger...
