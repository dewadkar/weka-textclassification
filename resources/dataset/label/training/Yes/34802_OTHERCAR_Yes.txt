            	The CarMax entry as a Mitsu' dealer is a significantly positive feature for owning any of the line up.  My experience with other dealers had been severely wanting.  Buying any vehicle is only the beginning.  What's essential is that the car is serviced by a shop that sets aggressive standards of being up to date on tech bulletins, and demanding of their finished work.

	What I found at CarMax was a solid match of attention and follow through.  While the Montero Sport is well worth the money, it is the dealer support exhibited by CarMax shop that makes it a valuable investment.
