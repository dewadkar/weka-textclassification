            In 1999 Volkswagen changed the whole design of their most popular vehicle, the Jetta.  They eliminated the sharp angles and replaced them with smooth, gentle curves.  These cosmetic changes have catapulted the Jetta into a real superstar.  

With it's sleek new looks, an amazing advertisement campaign and affordable price tag the Jetta has become the number one German car in America.  Sometimes called the poor mans Mercedes, the Jetta is probably better compared to the new Audi.  It is obvious that the Jetta (as well as the new Passat), share many of the same style designs as their cousin the Audi A4.

The Jetta handles amazingly well, taking corners like a real pro.  By no means a sports car, I have been impressed with its power, especially when needed.  It maintains speed while climbing hills and passing others is a breeze.  One thing to be aware of are the Jetta's super sensitive brakes.  Just a tap and you notice a significant slow down.  

Comfortable seats with plenty of back support make the Jetta perfect for long road trips or long commutes to work.  Both front seats have plenty of leg and head room, although very tall people may find it a bit tight.  The back seats leave something to be desired.  While not as small as other cars, the Jettas back seats are far from roomy.  Perfect for children, but full sized adults will feel packed in.  What it lacks in backseat space it more then makes up for it in trunk space.  The Jetta has one of the roomiest trunks I've seen in a long time.

The Jetta is simple, affordable elegance that's perfect for small families as well as those who are looking for fun.  Amazing gas mileage makes it even more of a winner.<br><br>
