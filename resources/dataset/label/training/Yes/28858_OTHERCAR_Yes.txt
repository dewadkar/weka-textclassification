            I started out in the digital field with a low end Casio camera. I have since moved upto a Kodak 210. What I have found out is that the key to good photos is the printer. Even with my Casio and now my Kodak, with my old HP 855 the quality wasn't there. Now I have invested in a HP 812 and even my old low res photo's look great. The Kodak have been a great choice because of quality and service. With my new printer combination camera I now don't even use my conventional camera system. Why wait for development when I can download a photo with great results in two minuets. Digital camera's are especially great for sending E-Mails to family members and friends. I have found that you can depend on Kodak's quality and dependablity.<br><br>
