            This is our second CR-V.  We had a 1998 EX with 46,000km (28,750miles) on when we traded it for a 2002 EX-L.  Yes, it's called an EX-L(leather)up here in Canada and I cannot figure out why there is no leather in US models.  Ours came with a power moon roof, heated leather(repeated for the creature feature bonus points)seats, and painted body color bumpers, door handles and mirrors.
It reminds me of a Volvo wagon from the rear.  From the front, a bit like an Acura 1.7 sedan.
My wife loved her '98 but I found the lack of power and noise levels almost unbearable.  My '98 Z71 Chevy pickup is twice as quiet as the 98CR-V. I can no longer say the CR-V is gutless, noisy or plain jane.  The transmission shifts so seamlessly, I have a difficult time believing it's a Honda.  Coupled with the new 2.4l i-vtec engine, I have no qualms about driving one of these now.  The new leather interior no longer looks like someone took it to the neighborhood upholsterer for a quick recovering of the cloth seats.
I think Honda did a great job of targeting potential buyers. Many Honda owners are repeat owners and we tend to come back because of reputation.  We also tend to try out new products even if they are unproven, because we TRUST Honda build and engineering quality.  Just use the first generation Odessey and CR-V as examples.  Honda, "Gets It".  They are often a "fast second".  They start with a good idea, usually after someone else is first off the line, and then they improve a few things, add a few things and voila... they have a good unit they can be proud of building and people are proud to own them.
My question still is... "Why doesn't the US have an EX-L (leather version) available?
