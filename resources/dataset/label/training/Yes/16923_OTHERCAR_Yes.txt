            Subaru Outback Limited
I have been searching for a new sedan or wagon to replace my aging 10 year old Acura Integra. The Integra has given me years of trouble free miles, performing solidly without complaint. This has predisposed me to get another fine Acura product, but I would not rule out a Subaru since their reputation for trouble free cars is also very good. 

Outback impressions:
My mind kept screaming, �It�s a station wagon! A station wagon!� After getting over the initial reluctance I was able to rationalize that maybe  it�s a cool looking station wagon. Maybe its like one of those cool wood panel station wagons you see in the surfer movies like �Endless Summer�, or one could think of it like an off road Mad Max sort of vehicle. OK, who am I kidding? It�s a station wagon and this is one of the quintessential yuppie cars for those who are aging and are desperate for any alternative to a mini-van. 

Performance:
The ride is actually very nice. The pickup is good for a vehicle of this size. The four wheel drive grips the road well, although tight cornering will lean the body in an unsettling manner and strong breaking will cause significant nose dive. The four wheel drive is a great system and I am sure very reassuring in icy conditions. 

One automobile enthusiast warned me that four wheel drive does not mean four wheel stop, meaning that a four wheel drive car with ABS will stop in just as much room on ice as a front wheel drive car with ABS. You are less likely to get bogged down and stuck in the snow, but not less likely not to crash. People tend to forget this in the winter and don�t slow down as much as they should because they think that 4 wheel drive means invulnerability. For those that drive a lot in the snow, you should look at the Volvo S80 or other cars with the Dynamic stability control system. This system uses the ABS brakes to modulate braking and power to each wheel to control the yaw of the car and prevent skids and spin outs. Many cars also have a traction control system that allows them to avoid slipping the wheels on startup. I think these systems will become more and more popular as time goes on and the technology improves. 

Interior: Considering the price of the car, the interior is certainly on the cheap side. You can get it outfitted with leather and a CD, but most of the instruments are very cheap looking. It sort of reminds me of an older Honda Accord interior. It�s well thought out and efficient, but by no means luxurious. The big deal is that there is a ton of room in the car. There is easily as much room as in most SUV interiors. Some of the larger monster SUVs, the Expedition, Durango, Excursion have more room, but their ride quality is no where near the nice ride of the Subaru. I think that the Subaru really hits the sweet spot of optimization of interior room for kids and cargo and nice ride. It adds to that the security of 4 wheel drive. Fuel economy is more like a car than a gas guzzling truck. 
Summary:
Is this a car for Off road excursion/camping?: Not really. Despite what you see in the Crocodile Dundee commercials, this car is not an off road vehicle. It is four wheel drive, so can go on some rough roads and should do well in snow and on ice. I would not expect it to climb up and down ravines, it doesn�t have the suspension or the ground clearance. This vehicle would be good for car camping. 
Is this a good wagon for Carpools, kidmobile?: Lets face it, this is the ideal use for this auto. It is made for people to tow around kids and all their paraphernalia, diapers, toys, luggage, etc. This car is good for people not ready for a mini van but too used to normal cars to get a big SUV.
