            My wife had been wanting a Dodge Dakota 4x4 for a few years so I finally broke down and bought her one.  After a few weeks of searching, we found a nice Red 1997 Club Cab 4x4 V6 SLT with 60,000 miles on it.  Body and interior were in excellent shape, the motor was sound and everything worked.  Didn't even look like it had been off-roaded at all.  She's put 20,000 miles on it so far with only 2 major problems.  After 2 months, she was making a turn when she heard a loud &quot;pop&quot; and the steering got VERY sloppy.  Found out that the steering box mounting bolts had sheared off and the steering box was just flopping around.  Would have been very bad news on the highway, luckily she was in a parking lot.  That repair job only cost me $80.00.  3 months later problem #2 popped up.  She noticed the truck was sounding a little rough. I popped the hood and found the passenger side exhaust manifold was leaking.  When I took the manifold off, I discovered that 2 of the 4 manifold studs had sheared flush with the head.  NUTS!!! Why Dodge uses cheezy little 5/16&quot; manifold studs I'll never know.  After I pulled the head, a local machine shop drilled the broken studs out and installed new inserts at a cost of $100.00.  Add another $80.00 for gasket sets.  My 20 hours of labor and busted knuckles saved me about a grand.  Note:  Dodge V6's have a problem with oil leaking around the back of the intake manifold pan.  I hadn't noticed it because mine wasn't leaking too bad yet, but I replaced all the gaskets with high quality FEL-PRO and that fixed it right up.  Also, Dodge doesn't use exhaust manifold gaskets, so I installed some aftermarket ones.
Conclusion:  Except for these 2 gripes, the truck has been a very good performer.  She drives it every day, plus it's great on long trips.  Good power and the mileage isn't TOO bad at 18/21 mpg town/hwy.  I don't know if the broken bolts show that the truck was beaten by the previous owner or if was just crappy hardware.  I'd like to hear if any other Dodge owners have experienced similar problems.<br><br>
