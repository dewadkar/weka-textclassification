                My trusty and indestructible 1987 Toyota pickup had taken me across the country more times than I could remember, but I had a baby on they way.  Babies need back seats, baby, so I suddenly found myself in the market for a reliable car with room for a family. Sport Utes were out of the question - I regularly fire mock bazooka's at the eco-disaster Armored Personel Carriers that populate local parking lots - so I started to cruise local dealers to see what they had to offer.  I had never heard of Daewoo.

   I drove the Hyundai wagon, which ran about 14,000.  The Elantra seemed serviceable and had a killer warranty, but it didn't really feel like a CAR.  Acceleration was sluggish, the interior minimalist, and I never really felt like it was anything more than an oversized go cart.  I drove some used Volvo wagons, but anything with under 100,000 miles on it was out of my price range. Besides, they didn't seem that reliable to me.  The Toyota had given me 190,000 miles with no hassles, and I was about to start acquiring car problems with a kid on the way.
       Toyota and Honda both stopped making wagons, and those Subarus are pricey and, let us say, stylistically challenged. I saw an ad in the local paper for Daewoo and the rest is history.

   This car offers incredible quality for the price. It drives like an upscale wagon, almost on par with an Audi or a Saab and certainly equal to the new Volvos.  It doesn't have the heft of the latter, but is solid, corners well, and has decent acceleration.  The &quot;power&quot; feature seems like a gimmick, so I never use it, but performance is fine anyway  The stereo cranks, and fuel economy is consistently in the low 20's in around town driving. Best of all, I was able to get leather and a sunroof for less than a grand, and drove away from the lot with an excellent car for 16,000. I am retiring the truck to yard work, and now count on my stylish new ride for at least the next 10 years. And Jackson, my new boy, loves it....

   I have honestly not found any negatives in the first 800 miles of driving.  I suppose the limited dealership problem and unproven record of Daewoo in the US is a bit of a worry, but my local dealer has been exemplary and I have great faith that Daewoo's worldwide production will consistently grow.  If they keep making cars like this, they will be the next Honda.
