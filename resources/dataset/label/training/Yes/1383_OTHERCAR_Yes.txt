            I have owned several economy hatchbacks over the past several years, and I believe this is my favorite.  I usually buy my cars towards the end of the depreciation curve, and this one was no different.  It had 100,000 miles on it when purchased.  The dealer ( a good friend of mine) informed me of all of the problems with the car when I bought it, mainly of the lock cylinder that comes out when you unlock it.  Everything else was minor trim and cosmetic issues common to 7 year old cars.

It is now 9 months and 20000 miles later and this car has far exceeded my expectations.  I have not made a single repair on this car.  I did install a remote entry system ($190) instead of fixing the lock cylinder ($220 estimate).  The mechanic told me that this was the most common problem he encountered with this car.  Apart from that I've only paid for a tune up and oil changes.  I'm well aware that it is pretty much luck of the draw when you are buying cars of this age, but this car has been better for me than any of the other cars in it's class I've owned (Nissan Stanza wagon, 1994 Honda Civic, 2000 Ford Focus, 1997 Saab 900).

This car does have it's shortfalls.  It's noisey at most speeds.  Most hatchbacks are, but this one is a little more than most.  The fuel economy is good, but not stellar.  I average 30 MPG on mostly highway driving.  Everything but the Saab did better in that category.  It has it's share of squeaks and rattles, but the Ford Focus had more at 60000 miles than this does at 120000 miles.  The front grill is a little loose, along with the driver side rub strip.  The cushion on the driver seat is disformed (the previous owner must have been obese).

That's about it, though.  This car handles better than any of the previously mentioned cars, it's fun to drive, the premium sound option on this particular model is great, and it offers great utility with the fold flat rear seats.  I've talked to a couple of mechanics, and they have told me that this engine will run for 200000 miles easily with minimal care, and at this point I certainly believe them.
