            I bought the `99 VW Passat GLX in September (`99) after my Dad convinced me to get this one instead of the Jetta.  I have to tell you -- this is definitely a bigger car, but it doesn't feel clunky like other mid-size cars.  &quot;My Baby&quot; has got the zip I want to get in and out of traffic, the awesome feel of driving (not just steering), and reacts quickly in situations where I need it to.  I just drove it in snow this winter, and it's great on snow/slush.  

The handling is smooth though you may need to get used to the shocks in the beginning because you feel the road.  The VW engineers and designers did a magnificent job on the car -- everything's within perfect reach and the car is very roomy (even the trunk is huge).  The only thing missing is a place for highway tokens and quarters for tolls, but that's easily fixed with the ashtray I use for loose change.  

Everyone and anyone looking for an excellent and value-added mid-size car should look into the VW Passat GLX (I chose it over the Audi A4).  If you like to drive, are looking for a near-luxury car, run over to your nearest VW dealer and take one for a test drive -- you won't be sorry!<br><br>
