            I was looking to replace the compact car I had been driving for five years. While an SUV fan, I had to come to my senses recognizing my daily commute includes 100 miles of highway driving, the likes of which would have put a considerable hole in my pocket in gas expenses. Here is my list of must haves in a car:  safety, quality, gas efficiency, and looks.

 SAFETY: Jetta by far beat all cars in its category, with four wheel anti-lock brakes, four wheel disc brakes, front and side impact airbags, anti-theft system with panic button, and a full-size spare tire.  Comparing these standard features to other vehicles in its class like the Civic, and Saturn I realized that they either didn't have them all, or that to get them in the other vehicles it would cost several thousand dollars more. Quality was of concern, it is hard to beat Toyota's or Honda's well-earned reputation even Saturn's, and to tell you the truth VW's reputation was not the best for a few years. If you remember it was the VW bug and more comprehensive warranties that brought VW back from an almost unavoidable bankruptcy. I decided to take a chance after reading many positive reviews some of which included a recommendation from Consumer Reports.  The 10Year-100k power train warranty boosted my confidence on the vehicle. The downfall is a short 24 months 24k bumper-to-bumper warranty (most other manufacturers offer a 3yr/36 warranty).
GAS EFFICIENCY: I bought the Jetta GL 2.0 with manual transmission.  I chose the manual transmission, because after driving the automatic I felt it lacked enough pick up to offer the kind of ride I like.  The automatic transmission wasn't as responsive as my driving style needs it to be.  I have driven almost 3,000 miles on my car and so far the average gas mileage is between 33-34 miles to the gallon.  This is great mileage for a vehicle of its weight and power (even on a four cylinder).

LOOKS:  My personal opinion is this car is sharp.  It has a beefy stance, the headlights are modern and stylized.  The design is clean and modernï¿½ no frills beauty. The rear is wide and bulky it makes its presence on the road.  The car is also classic in lines and simple and flush around adjoining panels.  The 16&quot; wheels give this sedan a noticeable sporty feel. The instrument illumination is fun to look at, all instruments are backlighted with a modern blue tone and the indicators stand out with a sharp electric red. The cup holders are not very well placed for a stick shift design; every time you shift and lift your hand off the stick your hand bumps the cup holder.  Interior room is great for front passengers, but rear passengers always seem to be begging for space from the people in the front.  Three point seatbelts for ALL passengers in the car is a plus.  The trunk is spacious and the lid design makes it easy to get things in and out of it.  

Don't plan on helping stranded motorists as the battery and almost everything else in the Jetta's engine is covered with plastic covers.  And once you remove them I don't think you will recognize what is what.  As a matter of fact my VW service department warned me against jump-starting anybody with my vehicle (not that I do this every day). In other words, don't plan on doing any maintenance on this car on your own except for checking fluid levels.  

I recommend this car for singles, or DINCS (dual income no children couples), definitively not for families with children.
