            Last year I decided to go back to school and finish my Ph.D.  Knowing that this would require at least three years of &quot;living like a student&quot; on a very fixed income, I knew it was time to trade in my last car for one that was more reliable.  After a fair amount of reading in various publications, I narrowed the list of potential vehicles based upon price, maintenance records, driving costs, repair costs, etc...  The final candidates were early to mid 90's Maximas, several makes of Acura and Mazda, and the Mitsubishi Diamante.  As far as established reputations, published or otherwise, all were very competitive, that is, until price comparisons were made.  In a number of instances, I found Diamantes at half the price of competitors in similar condition.  For me, the choice was obvious.  I bought a 1992 Mitsubishi Diamante (V6 single cam)in very clean condition with 112k miles for $5800.  It now has 128k miles.

In the year that I've owned the car, I have replaced an exhaust component (cost: $100), replaced the timing belt (routine maintenance at 120k miles, cost: $375), four oil changes and a tune-up.  I have also replaced a headlamp bulb (cost: $3), the same tail light bulb twice (cost: $2 each time), and both reverse lights have gone out, perhaps indicative of a small electrical problem.

Despite proper maintenance, the car is sluggish on hills, feeling as though the timing is always off a bit, hesitating until rpm's are above 3000.  On the freeway, this usually means the car down-shifts hard, from about 2700 rpm's to 4000 rpm's, a bit worrisome for a transmission with nearly 130k.  The front brakes shimmy slightly.

Other than this, the car is a dream.  Very comfortable, although a few more inches of head room would be nice, very quiet, and very stylish inside and out.  The car is very stable on the road, having a heavy car feel, yet can be incredibly nimble with its sensitive steering and low stance.  I love the instrument layout and the interior styling.  Many friends have guessed the price at more than twice what I paid for it.  If I could have given one piece of advice to Mitsubishi when building this car, &quot;Give it more low end power&quot;.  The car easily exceeds 100mph on the freeway, but getting their can take a little run-up, unless you don't mind redlining.  The car has plenty of power, once I'm above about 3100 rpm's.  Below that is where the lack of low end torque is noticeable.      <br><br>
