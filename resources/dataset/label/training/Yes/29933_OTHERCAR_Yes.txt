            On the road the Montero is surprisingly pleasant, gone is the body roll on curves and barely adequate ride. The 2001 Montero rides firm but comfortable. The steering has a precise feel and the handling always gives the driver a feeling of control. The 200 horsepower V-6 engine pulls strongly at low speeds but feel flat at 45-55 miles per hour. At highway speeds the ride is quiet. Driving around town the Montero is surprisingly nimble; the turning radius is over one foot shorter than last yearï¿½s model. Fuel economy is rated at 13 miles per gallon in the city and 18 miles per gallon on the highway; I averaged just over 16 miles per gallon in a mix of city and highway travel. Premium fuel is required. 

The cabin of the Montero is comfortable and offers a great view of the road ahead. The firm seats are fully adjustable and remain comfortable after a long drive. The controls are easy to use with controls falling readily to hand. The large rear view mirrors offer a good view with only the outside mounted spare tire making parallel parking a potential hazard.
The rear seats accommodate adults but will become uncomfortable for those with long legs. Available in the Montero is a handy third row forward facing seat that disappears completely into the floor when not needed. Although designed to carry seven passengers the Montero requires rear seat occupants be limber and not mind climbing to their seats. A huge sunroof opens up the interior of the Montero, and even fully open causes very little turbulence. 

If you are in the market for a four-wheel drive sport utility vehicle that has the ability to handle off road excursions and want to stand apart from the SUV crowd, take a look at the Mitsubishi Montero.
