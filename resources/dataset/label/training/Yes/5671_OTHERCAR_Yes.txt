            I am completely new to the digital photography arena and was very skeptical about the quality of the photographs versus using a traditional 35mm film camera (had a Nikon and Minolta). I am 100% sold on the 330 having researched the Nikon Coolpix and Minolta Dimage X extentsively. I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THE 330 AND IT DOES EVERYTHING AND MORE THAN I EXPECTED. 

I just returned from 3 weeks in Bali and Thailand and took over 600 pictures with the 330. ALL of the outdoor pictures were extra sharp with superb color. I had two dinner parties with my fiances family and took about 50 of the family in tungsten light conditions at ISO 50. If I stayed within the 3.5 meter or 11 foot range, the pictures came out clear. At farther distances using the zoom, the pictures were dark and the color not sharp. This was my fault for not using a higher ISO, possibly 100 or 200, and being to far away from the subjects. Just forgot in the excitement of the moment. The battery lasted for about 175 shots and we looked at almost all the pictures in the LCD after taking them. I blew up about 10 shots to 8 x 10 using Photoshop Elements, Microsoft Picture It and from my card reader directly from My Computer using Microsoft ME. The best pictures came from printing directly from My Computer. 

I purchased the HP Photosmart 100 portable printer and took it with me. The pictures were as clear as using a photo lab, at least to my untrained eye. I compared the 100 with the small Canon and Sony printers using my compact flash card and pictures of stained glass lampshades with a variety of colors. The 100 clearly was the best of the lot. With my printer cartridge I was able to print about 225 prints. 

I hope this information will be helpful for anyone considering the 330.
