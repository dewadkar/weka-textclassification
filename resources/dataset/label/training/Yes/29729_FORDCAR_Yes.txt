            I can't say enough to praise this vehicle!  We own a 1997 Ford Explorer, V8, Eddie Bauer edition.  We just love it!

I got it after the birth of my baby in Nov. of 98.  I wanted a &quot;safe&quot; vehicle, especially for the winter months in New England.  This car feels safe, drives wonderfully, and is a pleasure to be in!  It is very comfortable!

This is a &quot;smart&quot; vehicle!  It has a feature that tells you how many driving miles are left in the tank, when the oil needs to be changed, whether the other components are working properly.  It keeps you from wondering.  Also tells you the temperature outside and tells you when the surface you are driving on is &quot;ice&quot;.  This car feel very stable as well.  I can't imagine having any problems with this SUV.  I feel totally protected, pampered (soft leather seats, CD player, power everything), and secure.

This is a great car for anyone, men or women!  It's a car you will love, and you can trust.
