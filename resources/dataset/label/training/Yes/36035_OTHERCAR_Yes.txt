            My husband and I leased a Saab 900S in 96 as a shared car for mostly city driving. The key decision point for us was that the hatchback allowed for lots of storage, but wasn't so big that parking in the city was a hassle.

We've now bought the lease out and it's still a great car for our needs -- even though they've changed. I now commute 40 miles round trip a day and the gas mileage is great. It's a comfortable ride and feels safe on the highway.

There are a few drawbacks in the Saab 900 - mostly user amenities. There is not adequate space for 2 beverages (and the main beverage holder is awkward to get to); the interior light button is hidden and tough to get to quickly; there is not enough storage space for little &quot;stuff&quot; for the driver (like the garage door opener); and I really wish there was an interior light/indicator for when the latch is unhooked on the trunk/hatch.<br><br>
