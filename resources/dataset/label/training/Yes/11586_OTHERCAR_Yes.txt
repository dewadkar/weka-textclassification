            The Izuzu Rodeo is the perfect SUV for anyone who wants the size and safety of an SUV without the high price tag of an SUV.Here's way I recommend this truck.
-  Maintenance is extremely low.  My former and current Rodeo's run like a champ and have only been in the shop for routine replacements, i.e. tires, airfilters.
-  Size.  The Rodeo rides a bit higher than the other SUV's such as the Ford Explorer.  This added height gives the driver the feeling that he or she is sitting up above the traffic.
-  Safety.  Check out the impressive safety records of Rodeo in Consumer Reports.
-  Styling.  The Rodeo's long frame and stylish curves really stand out.
-  PRICE.  You can't beat this car in price. For what you get, this truck is a true value.
I highly recommend the sports utility vehicle.<br><br>
