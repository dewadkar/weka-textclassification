                  This new car that's selling like hot cakes SHOULD be selling like hot cakes.  The gas milage is good and the car has some zoom to it.  The car's looks will catch everyones eyes and they aren't that expensive.  I love this car because of the looks and the great fuel economy.  Looks are deceiving though.  It may look small but its got just as much leg room as any sedan.  I wouldn't compare this to a Neon because its in a class of its own.  Even with all the leg room its still got all the room in the trunk for groceries.  It comes with many gadgets such as a mini picnic table like device for all you tale-gatters and a mesh basket for first aid and whatever you'd put in there.  The seats fold over so you can haul furniture and such.  This is a great vehicle for everyone so I suggest you to go out and buy one for yourself.



Thanx
