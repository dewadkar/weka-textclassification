                Legend........The name says it all.  The 1991 Acura Legend is definitely a &quot;Legend&quot;.  This sleek, beautiful, V6, 3.2 Liter, 200 horsepower machine is the envy of any car buff.  I don't actually own an Acura myself.....yet, but I am in a relationship with someone who owns one and let me say this car is his baby.  This car is extremely special to my boyfriend.  He washes this car at least once a week and if it rains he gets mad.  He could tell you every statistic of this car right down to the tread.  He bought his Legend in January of 2000 and has since put 18&quot; chrome 5 star rims and HID headlights in.  The reason why he loves this car soo much was because nobody has them where we live.  The style of the car makes it look like a 2000 body style.  The have discontinued the Legend in 1995 so now they have the Acura RL in replacement.  My boyfriends Legend has 160,000 miles on it and to this day had never had a problem with it.  We drive to Los Angeles (about 300 miles) about twice a month and everything runs sooo smooth.  When you are in this car the comfort and quietness is enough to put you to sleep.  You couldn't imagine how many times he is asked &quot;Is that new&quot; or &quot;Is that lowered&quot; (The cars are really wide and long, and the stance is low.

     This car is pure luxury and I definitely recommend that if you ever get the chance to drive one you take the offer.
