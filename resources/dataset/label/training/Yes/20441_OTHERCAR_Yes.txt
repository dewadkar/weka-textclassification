            After I grudgingly sold a 1975 VW bus, I decided to go for something a little more economical. In the VW family, I test-drove the 2000 Jetta and the 2000 Golf. The two cars handled similarly, but the Golf was just a tad too compact for someone with two dogs and the occasional passenger(s). 

Beware before test-driving a Jetta: They are immensely fun to drive, and have a pick-up that's surprisingly peppy for your typical sedan. I did not test-drive an automatic, so I can speak only for the five-speed Jetta. Three words: fast and fun!

A nice thing about my car, too, is that the standard features are all useful and somewhat fancy. The doors lock automatically when my speed reaches 10 mph, preventing a dreaded "car-jacking." The stereo and speaker systems are of good quality. I didn't opt for a CD player, but many of the available cars on the lot had them pre-installed. The crank-windows open and close quickly and smoothly. 

A word about the dashboard lights: Though this is a minor detail, they are VERY cool-looking. They're iridescent blue with red accents, and can be brightened or dimmed with the flip of a switch.

Onto the mechanics of driving this car: I adore the transmission--shifting is more enjoyable than ever (smooth, quick and not at all awkward). As I mentioned before, the 2000 Jetta is an immensely peppy car. It takes corners well, and I feel safe driving it. (The driver, passenger and side airbags--standard features once again--help, too.)

The electronic "key" system, with fully functioning alarm, is not only nice as a safety feature, but makes it virtually impossible to lock oneself out of the car.

But a few caveats: Some of the "extraneous" outer features, like the two front grills on the bumper, are not too secure. I went over a bump too quickly once, and one of the said grills popped right out. Have to get that fixed. The front of the car in general is a bit of a mess. Something is constantly rattling (I live on a very bumpy dirt road, it's true, but the suspension should be better than this!)

Also, the Jetta doesn't run as quietly as I thought it might. When you're in the throes of a fun, quick drive, it's almost pleasant to hear the engine like that, but in general it's not as quiet as comparable sedans.

Back seat isn't very roomy, either. Usually not a problem for a childless person like myself, however.

I will hold onto this car for the next 10 years or so, probably. I commute 35 minutes to work every day, and the Jetta suits my needs just fine.
