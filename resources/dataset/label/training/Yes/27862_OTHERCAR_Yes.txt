            My Dodge Grand Caravan ES was, in my opinion, the best van on the market. She has 4 Captain Chairs, 1 bench and fully loaded w/cd player, power everything, the WORKS! I have not had the honor of purchasing a newer Grand caravan yet, but why should I when mine drives beautifully and I have had very few problems?  My van was bought new, 6 years ago, and still drives like a dream.

We have had very minimal mechanical problems with ours.  We recently had to replace some type of converter and thermostat, but only after 123,000 miles.  We have not had one electrical problem, knock on wood, and it took us 6 years before we had to put money into her, besides the regular tune-ups.

We bought our van when our first child was born, because with children, if you go anywhere, you pack the entire house.  Since purchasing our van, we have had two more children, both who are still in car seats.  I do not know what I would have done without my van.  With it being the Grand, I have about 1 foot extra space, and all the extras to make the trips, short and long, comfortable for all.  

I have 0 complaints about this vehicle.  I am even debating on trading it in, but with it driving so good and being paid off, I hate to get another payment just to have the newer body style.  So, for now, I am sticking with my 1994.  Maybe it was luck that I found such a reliable, comfortable van or maybe Dodge just knows what they are doing!  Either way, I am happy and in the future I will only buy Dodge! <br><br>
