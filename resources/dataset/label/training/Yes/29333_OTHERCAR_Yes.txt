            I actually got my Tracker by misfortune. I got a bad deal on a previous truck, and needed to get a vehicle quick. I needed a truck that was high enough so that it did not feel that I was sitting on the ground, yet &quot;cheap&quot; enough for me to afford. The Tracker fit the bill perfectly. It has great ground clearance, a stylish look, and it's convertible!! Although I did not get the 4x4 (which I wanted), but I did get the 2.0 liter engine. I had this size engine in a car before and found it to be a decent power plant. The 2.0 makes the Tracker a nimble vehicle. 
It has plenty of room inside the cabin. I had four adults in the Tracker at once, comfortably. The only draw back I think is the small, all most rail like tires Chevy decided to put on the Tracker.     
I think dollar for dollar the Tracker is a better buy than it's competitors in the small suv class. <br><br>
