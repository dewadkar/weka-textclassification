            My first three cars were Toyota Corollas.  Then I decided to try something different -- a Subaru XT.  Although I enjoyed it and had it for about 9 years, it didn't come without problems.  I decided to go back with a Toyota -- but which one?  I had occasionally seen an MR2 on the road but was certain that it would be out of my price range -- even a '91 had to be at least $12,000 (I'm talking 1997 here).  I happened to take a look at an MR2 ad in the paper and, to my surprise, the price was REASONABLE!  They were between $6500 and $10,000.  Well, I decided that I had to think no further -- my next car would be an MR2.  Looked at many and finally (and, again, to my surprise) found the best one at a car dealer (non-Toyota).

Well, the MR2 has been car I've ever owned.  I absolutely love it.

It drives like a dream.  It is VERY comfortable.  I have had NO mechanical problems with it.  The only problems I've had are minor -- the headlights seem to need to be replaced like once every 1-2 years (or is this normal? -- I thought headlight life was more like 3-4 years).  Also, I believe the previous owner did something to the panel above the passenger-side floorboard and now when I go really fast air rushing in makes the panel flutter.  A not-very-good mechanic tried fixing it -- I'm in the process of finding someone who can.

This is a car that, for a Toyota, gets AMAZING comments.  The model is 1991, but people think it is a fairly new car -- I guess I keep it in good shape, although need to wash more often!  I live in Vegas and the hotel valets frequently say "cool wheels!"  Co-workers that see my car for the first time are like, "wow -- you can afford THAT?"  With the fact that the car is just a GOOD CAR, getting these extra comments are like icing on the cake.

(Update 2/24/01):  In reading some of the other opinions on MR2, I wanted to specify that my model is non-turbo, non-T-top, automatic.  I investigated all model variations when I was in the market to buy and was told upon more than one occasion that the turbo model could be problematic, and that the T-Tops could have leakage and safety problems.  That is not to say that ALL turbos or ALL T-tops will have problems.  I have, too, read opinions from people who have those features and have no problems.  However, I would recommend that buyers carefully research the reliability and maintenance history of the turbo systems and/or T-tops when considering a purchase.  I was originally going to buy a 5-speed, but of all the models I found the one with the best overall record, functionability and appearance happened to be an automatic, so I bought it.  The car just turned 85,000 miles, and I've had it since 50k.  Up to this point, haven't had one problem (excepting the very minor ones above).
