            Pictures

This camera is great for beginners and advanced ones.  It has a wheel that takes care of just about every situation. For the novice, you can set it on automatic, people, scenery, night, fast object, slow object, panorama, and movie mode. These modes are specifically designed to get you the best picture for a particular situation.

For the professional, there are four modes in which you can adjust everything from brightness and shutter speed to flash power.  Itï¿½s great for those who want to fine-tune their pictures. 

Organization

Pictures stored on the compact flash card are automatically numbered. Besides scrolling through pictures one by one, you can also bring up a thumbnail mode to view nine pictures at once, and even bring up a scroll bar.  These latter features are really helpful for people who take lots of pictures.

There is even a slideshow option with adjustable intervals so you can view all of your masterpieces right on your camera.

Options

What the Powershot S30 does not have is a lack of options.  You can configure everything from picture quality, compression mode, review time, to startup picture, startup sound, and the sound heard when you take a picture.  When viewing photos, the menu allows you to protect photos from accidental erasure, rotate them, and more.

Battery Life

For an average user like me, the battery life is sufficient.  On my trip to New York City, I took about 70 pictures in a day, and the battery did not run out until the very end of the day, in the hotel room.

However, a very long battery life is only possible if the built-in LCD screen is not used, a feature that drains energy quickly.
