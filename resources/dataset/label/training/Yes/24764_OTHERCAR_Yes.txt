            A long time ago, Mickey told Rocky "Speed, speed, speed is what we need!"

He wasn't kidding. And when it comes to capturing your sports memories with a digital camera, shutter speed has definitely got to be at the top of the priority list.

I took the C-720 Ultra Zoom to my nephew's little league game for a test run. The camera definitely outperformed little Joey's team, but I did get a very nice, five shot, max-resolution sequence of Joey diving for a ball and coming up empty-handed.

The 8X optical lens is great for zooming at sporting events like this ... and for great close-ups of the kids on the bench.

The flash was more powerful than I expected, providing enough light for objects nearly 20 feet away at twilight.

The small LCD display provides a clear enough preview of your photos without being a huge drain on the batteries. 

Manual controls for white balance, exposure and flash control provide versatility for more experienced photographers without complicating the controls for newbies. 

Image quality from the C-720 was excellent, although the resolution suffered when I used the digital zoom. Battery life was also very good, more likely due to the high quality lithium batteries that came with the camera than the camera itself.

The C-720 was among the larger point & shoot digital cameras we've tested at slightly under one pound, but a comparable 35-mm camera with an equivalent lens probably weighs more than five pounds and likely costs $2,000 or more.
