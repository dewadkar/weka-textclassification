            I was seriously considering purchasing a new Mazda Miata last year but did not for a few reasons, mostly because the car was not practical enough to suit my lifestyle. This review is based on my experiences during my test drive, but I have always been somewhat fond of Miatas so I have driven them on several other occasions. It's a great little car.

When I first saw the second generation Miata (the first generation ones look similar from afar, but have pop up headlights and a slightly different body curves), I noticed it was really small. I'm not a big guy at 5'10, but when I sat in the car, I noticed I fit in very nicely. However, if I had 2-3 inches more of height I would have been very uncomfortable.

The egronomics of the car are very simple. As all Japanese cars are driver oriented, the Miata is no different with most of the controls being within easy reach of the driver. I particularily liked the dash. The seats were also very nice and snug, but they were leather buckets and for a sports car I would have preferred cloth seats. 

When you are sitting in the Miata and driving it, you feel like you are VERY low to the ground. A quick shift up with your foot holding down the gas and this car zips through traffic. Although the new 2001 models have VVT-I (valve timing) and a bit more HP, the older models in the same generation are just as good in my opinion (and as proven performance wise by almost identical 0-60 times), but perhaps lack torque. The clutch is very silky smooth and not as hard as European cars. The RWD (rear wheel drive) layout is classic sports car.

Body-wise, this car looks better without the ground effects kits and spoiler. I believe the kit and spoiler just gets in the way of the smooth styling Mazda engineers designed, however, if you do find one with a kit, it still does look pretty good, but not that conservative.

Unfortunately a car with this much zip in it is not that practical for a family and long trips. Driving with the top down on long trips is fairly annoying (thankfully Mazda added a wind deflector), but if you cruise at a certain speed (I think it's around 100 km/h) a little rain will not hit the car and you because of the air going over the car. 

I would recommend this car to people who do not expect to carry a lot of luggage or passengers. This would also make a great 3rd car/weekend car. It may not have the most power, but if you buy a Porsche Boxster S, you won't be using 100% of the car's power on regular roads whereas with the Miata you will be hitting redline and flying into curves at the car's limits. That's VERY fun.
