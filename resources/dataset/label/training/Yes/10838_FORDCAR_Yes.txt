            I purchased a 98 Ford windstar in May 1999. I have to say it has been the most satisfying automobile purchase I have made in years.
I almost always buy used, or program vehicles. There are several reasons why but that's really not relevant here.
I have however been very happy with my 1999 Windstar which had 34k miles when I purchased it, and about 50k now. It has been a very solid vehicle with no problems at all! It has a spunky v-6 engine, which gets 19 mpg city and 27 mpg hwy. Not bad for relatively heavy vehicle. It must be due to the aerodynamic styling.
It is also very stylish with a touch of class, yet modest.
I was able to purchase an extended bumper to bumper warranty which which pretty much everything up to 5yr 75k miles.
As with any used vehicle I recommend doing your homework by having it checked out by a qualified service technician prior to purchase.
You can also see the vehicles service and repair history by simply asking your local Ford dealer. They're usually more than happy to assist. You need to provide the VIN number when contacting the dealer.
Hope this will help on your next trip to the car lot.  <br><br>
