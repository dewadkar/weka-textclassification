            Taking pictures in our home  is  nothing new. We used to go  through the rolls  one  after another.  The only  bad part was I still have  some I  never  got  developed yet.  We borrowed a  friend's digital camera just to see how they worked if  the  quality was better.  We  shot  a few  But the  nice part was we  could  download them to our  computer.   So  we   went out  and  bought one of our  own.  It is  the best  camera . The   best   feature is  after  you take a  picture  you  can see the picture  you  just took on the  display in back.  So if the picture is not  what  you  wanted you  can delete it and  take it again.  This  way  you do not  lose the moment waiting for your film to get developed.  And  Yes  we  take a  lap top  with us  so  we  can download the  pictures and  go on the  next trail and  take more. 
   It is  small and   very  easy to  use.  We  have  three kids and  they love to  use it .  They like to  take the picture and then see what they did .  Sometimes  they  take better ones than   grown ups.  
  It  has  different  setting  so the more in depth  you want the less pictures.  But  all  settings  are  fine. I  use  the  28 exp. and  my  pictures are  great!<br><br>
