            I love our Jeep. Eventhough we bought it slightly used, it still felt like a new car to us. In 1997, we decided to buy a used late model 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The dealer made us an offer we couldn't refuse, plus he through in an extra year on the warrantee.  I beleive we ended up paying 18,000 for a 27,000 dollar car that only had 12,000 miles on it. 

No the dealing didn't give us the little old lady story.


Our Jeep came with a 5.2L 185HP engine. Standard equipment includes dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, illuminated entry system and power windows and door locks. Other standard items include CFC-free air conditioning, removable folding rear seat and keyless remote entry system. I have the Larado model, but the Limited adds automatic climate control, fog lights, power leather seats and HomeLink remote transmitter.

My husband wanted to get a car that I wouldn't be afraid to drive. The is the main reason for picking the Jeep.  The suspension handles just like a car. The other SUVs that we test drove including the Explorer and Blazer felt like you were driving a truck and not a car.  Very stiff when driving.  My sister just got a 1999 Explorer and the ride was much smoother than I remembered from the 1995 model that we tested back before we bought our Jeep.

Cargo space is one concern that I have with the vehicle.  Now that I have two kids, the extra space in the car has disappeared.  On the 1996 Jeep, the tire is mounted in the storage area, which takes up valuable storage space. Since then, solved this problem by putting the tire underneath. I believe this started with the 1999 model. 

I do love the way the back seats fold forward to allow use to transport almost anything, like our whole deck furniture.  Something we wouldn't have been able to do with just a car. 

The Grand Cherokee's gas mileage is not the greatest. With the high gas prices this summer, it takes about 40.00 dollars to fill the tank. The gas take will hold 20 gallons, so fill up are still at regular 1 to 2 week intervals The Jeep averages about 18 miles per gallon on the highway and 15 miles per gallon in the city.  If gas continues to go up, we may have to rethink the Jeep.

Over the past 2 years when have only performed routine maintenance on the Jeep. We have experienced no major problems for a car with over 50,000 miles.

While we don't expect to have anymore kids, because of the limited cargo space and the gas mileage, I might have to consider a MiniVan (GASP) for our next purchase. Still, I love driving the Jeep.
