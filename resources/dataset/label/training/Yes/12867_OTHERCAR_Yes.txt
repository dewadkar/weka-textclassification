            1995 Infinity J30t

SUMMARY **************************

A good freeway car, lots of power and a good value.

I LIKE ***************************

For the price it�s a very luxurious car but also a lot of fun to drive. The 3.0 liter V6 gives lots of kick on the freeway and the rear-wheel drive improves handling. The car feels smaller than it is to drive. The interior is plush &amp; the controls are well laid out. The look of the car is fairly different than most of what you see on the street these days which is nice. It looks like there was a significant Jaguar influence on the design but it�s a Nissan product and brings their reputation for stellar quality . On the mechanical side I�m really happy with it. The engine is very reliable and I have had no significant problems with this car in a year of driving it. I have the Infinity Extended Warrantee, having purchased it through an Infinity dealer. The service staff have been excellent and have always really taken care of me and the car.

I HATE ****************************

This is nit picking time. The trunk is smaller than you�d think it would be give the overall size of the car this is due to a combination of the rear wheel drive and the shape of the rear end. The back seat is a tad small for three but fits two OK. The cup holders suck. 

WOULD I BUY ANOTHER ONE? **********

Maybe. I�d probably buy something else for variety�s sake but I really do like it. I would not buy one new as they seem to depreciate very quickly. The new sticker price for mine was 40k, I see them in the paper for less than 18k quite frequently. Of course this makes them a steal for a used car.
