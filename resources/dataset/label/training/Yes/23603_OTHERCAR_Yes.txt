            When I bought my Stealth and decided that the Talon was somewhat superfluous, I thought, hey, how about a big car for a change?  Well, you can't get much bigger than this.  I looked around for a long time before finding my 1993 Intrepid ES, waiting until I found one for a reasonable price.  It had a lot of miles, but my parents' Intrepid has 150k and hasn't fallen apart yet.  With the 3.5L V6, it's plenty fast (probably faster than the Talon), but at the cost of some lousy city mileage.  20 mpg is less than I would have hoped - the Stealth gets better than that.  On the other hand, I could probably fit the Stealth inside the Intrepid.  This car has easily the biggest back seat I've seen in any car.  You climb in and you feel like you're in a front seat of any other car, be it a Taurus or a Cadillac.  If you drive people around who have trouble folding into a car's back seat, or can't climb up into an SUV, this is a good car for you.  The trunk is enormous as well, although it would have been nice if the rear seats folded down.  The mileage gets better on the highway - cruising at 75 mph typically produced 27-28 mpg.  Also, the newest models have newer, better engines that get better mileage with more horsepower.  Then again, those newest models are quite a bit uglier, so it's a tradeoff.  As for reliability, within a month it was leaking gas from the injectors, but that was actually covered by a recall, so it was free.  It's got a small leak somewhere in the cooling system, but that's more of a nuisance than a problem, and not worth paying someone $80 to do a pressure check (now that I've said that, it'll blow a hose and melt down, I'm sure).  Other than that, it seems to be holding up well for the mileage.  It even has minimal wind noise, despite its age.  All in all, this is a fine vehicle, well worth looking into.<br><br>
