            My love affair with my saturn began in January of 1998. I really wanted a new Mustang Cobra, but this car was for my wife (now x-wife). We looked all over at all types of cars. My wife said &quot;Lets look at Saturn.&quot; As we pulled into the dealership my almost new Saturn was parked next to the front door. The first thing I saw was the purple metalflake paint, alloy rims, and rear deck spoiler. It was love at first sight for me ,but not for my wife. This car had leather seats. She wanted cloth. We looked at other cars on the lot but none of them had all the bells and whistles. We test drove the SL1 but it was a dog. no guts . After much convincing, my wife and I took out the purple SL2. As I pulled out of the lot, I hit the gas to pull into traffic and spun the tires! As I drove around I knew this was the car we were looking for. Back at the dealer, we were told that the car was priced wrong , the price on the car was 12,999, but it was really 13,999. I was then told if I wanted the car I could have it for 12,999. Six months later my wife became my x-wife and she took the saturn with her. After several calls from the bank I took my saturn back home. This meant selling my selling my 1983 Z/28. I did not need two cars and I needed the money. To my surprise the saturn was faster than my Z/28 and gave me twice the gas mileage! The only problems I have had with the car were the a/c went out at 49,000 miles and the drivers seat is broken. The leather did not stand up very well and makes the car look cheap.<br><br>
