            DEALERSHIP EXPERIENCE AND PRICE:
I purchased my black 2002 Dodge Neon in August 2002 from the New Roc City Dodge Dealership in New Rochelle, NY.  I first checked prices at other Dodge dealerships including Yonkers Avenue Dodge (awful sales staff) and White Plains Dodge (awful, rude manager).  I ended up getting the cheapest price - with the friendliest service - at New Roc City Dodge.

I bought a black 2002 Dodge Neon (automatic, A/C included) with the Sound and Sun package (power sunroof, six speakers, AM/FM/CD player with 4-CD disc-changer, and several other extras).  I paid a total of $14,900.  This was the "after rebate" price, but included tax, title, registration, and all other fees and charges.  

WARRANTY:
Came with a 3-year, 36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty with a 7-year warranty on the powertrain.  This is the standard warranty on all 2002 Dodge Neons.  Last month, Dodge sent me an offer to upgrade to a 7-year/70,000, bumper-to-bumper warranty ($100 deductible for each service call), for $1274, payable over a 12-month period.

DRIVING EXPERIENCE:
I have absolutely no complaints.  My Neon handles well, is roomy and comfortable in the front (a bit cramped in the back unless rear seat passenger is a child), and is small enough to maneuver and park in NYC.  It's sporty, which I love.  The spoiler (which comes standard with all Neon SXTs) and sun roof make it fun to drive.  Brakes well and turns are tight.  It's fun to sit in and the seat is positioned so that it doesn't feel like you are sitting low to the ground.  

Has rear window defroster and remote keyless entry.  One really cool feature is that when you get in, if you forget to lock the doors, they automatically lock once you hit about 15 mph.  (You can simply hit the electronic "unlock" switch if you would rather drive around with the doors unlocked.)  

Plenty of room in the trunk.  Rear seats fold down so that you can expand trunk space.  

There are three cup holders in the front between the driver's seat and front-passenger seat, as well as a center console that has a lid that can fold out and hold a cup for rear passengers.  

Another nice feature is that the engine parts are clearly marked - I mean CLEARLY marked! - so that mechanically-challenged people like me can easily see where to add oil, water, antifreeze, etc.

Only weird thing is that the front windows are power but the rear windows are manual.  And pick-up is a tad slow.  Nothing that detracts from the vehicle overall...I can definitely pass trucks on the highway with no problem!

DODGE SERVICE:
Dodge service has been good so far.  They've called me twice to offer me complimentary oil changes and winterization.  I've received questionaires from the Dodge corporate office to find out how my buying experience rated and to gauge my satisfaction with the car.

Overall, the 2002 Dodge Neon SXT is a great, sporty little car, and I'm very happy with my purchase.
