this car is awesome. Unlike its old versions this one is not small. It is almost the size of a full size car at the price of most compacts. It is roomy and comfortable. Lots of leg room in this one for all the tall people. It handles perfectly and has a nice sporty look. It also has quiet mechanicals. Since its a nissan it is very reliable. This thing will last you at last 10 years. IF your in the market for a &quot;small&quot; car than get this one. This beats the corrolla, civic, ecco, neon, focus and all the other compact cars. Don't believe me look for your self.
Car and driver did a recent review on compact cars and out of 10 cars this one was second place. Only the Mazda protege beat it and only by a little. I personally thing the Sentra looks alot better.
