            I purchased my 1990 five years ago and it has been a real trooper. I have the EX Model (top of the line for that year) and that made a difference. The EX model comes with power doors, windows, great sound, and a factory moon roof and the more powerful engine (especially the 5 speed version). My Accord now has 215,000 miles and while getting on the old side (14 years) is still dependable and trusty. 

The 1990 model is the longer model and is quite roomy as most Honda's are. The features of this car will spoil you! For one, you have the comfort of wish-bone suspension, which has been part of Honda suspension engineering for years, even on the lesser Civics models. Cruise control is easy to use. The four-bulb headlight arrangement is good for night driving. The dash board arrangement is sensible. The outside mirrors smartly fold back, which is great for car washing -- no bent or broken mirrors. You get a nice cup holder, lighted door bottoms, locked gas tank, and the "excellent" factory speakers set this model apart from many other sedans built in the early 90's. And or course these cars are very, very durable. I have only recently replace the front wheel bearings and I think my clutch pressure plate may be original, I've not had to change it yet. Incredible!

Sure, you have to replace things on an older model, but the things I am now replacing have been on the car well over 100,000 miles. I am not redundantly replacing things every year as you find with some domestic models of that same year, if they are STILL running at all! My drivers-side power window motor has gone out as of late. But this occurred "after" the 200,000 mile mark. The seat belts are a bit snug and I have had to have them replaced (Takata supplied seat belt recall), and the turning radius could be tighter for size of car. But, overall this is a great car to purchase used, as it was built to last, without the nuisance of repetitive car repairs and replacement parts over and over.
