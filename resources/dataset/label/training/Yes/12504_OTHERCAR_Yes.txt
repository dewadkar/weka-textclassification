            The Continental is an attitude car. This vehicle is a beauty to behold. The lines are aerodynamic in styling, the car begs to be driven. Once inside, the driver feels enveloped in a sense of comfort, settling into the leather chairs as the drivers seat, mirrors, and steering wheel adjust automatically to the preselected settings. The vehicle is a going machine but has a slight tendency for oversteering on curves. Acceleration is good, and once at cruising speed a person could turn up the 10 pack CD player and nestle into a long and comfortable journey.
The voice activated, handsfree phone built into the drivers side windshield is also an added feature. Be aware that it will cause stares you way because you are obviously talking but do not have the ubiquitous cellular glued to the side of your head.
