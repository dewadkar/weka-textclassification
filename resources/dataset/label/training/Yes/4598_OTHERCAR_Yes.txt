            The kids aren't getting any smaller so we decided to move up in size and get a minivan.  We ordered the Sienna XLE Limited because of the extras it offered above the other trim levels.  The Sienna has plenty of room for our family and enough gadgets to keep it from getting boring...at least for a while.  The only bland aspect of this vehicle is the exterior styling.  It gets lost on the road and in parking lots.  Not much sets it apart from other minivans.  For only $39,000+, this vehicle has features we didn't have on the more expensive Mercedes (that 3-pointed star on the hood adds a lot to the cost).  The DVD player keeps the kids occupied and the GPS nav system is fun to play with.  The nav system has been very accurate.  Throw away the road atlas!  The rear backup camera has been very useful and turns on automatically when shifting into reverse.  The Dynamic Laser Cruise Control is amazing.  You set one of several distance choices and the cruise control ensures that distance is maintained.  If the vehicle in front slows, the Sienna slows.  If the system calculates the gap closing too quickly it applies the brakes.  Only once did I feel it applied the brakes too aggressively.  I don't know if it also illuminates the brake lights.  It would be nice if it did.  Very happy with the vehicle so far.
