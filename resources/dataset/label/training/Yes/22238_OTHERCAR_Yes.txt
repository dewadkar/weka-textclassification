            I bought one of the first Z3's available in the US in April 1996.  I had to order it 6 months in advance.  It is the only car I have owned since then and I have driven it almost every day.  I've driven up and down the east coast from Florida to Maine, and I've been through 3 Virginia winters.

So, is it a primary car?  Well I've managed, but you probably wouldn't.  It won't take a hard suitcase, it won't take more than a weekend's soft luggage for two, and if you're more than 6 foot tall you won't want to be stuck in the rain in traffic every day.  Also, my car has a couple of storage cubbies which don't even exist on the 2000 models, so I hope you like the extra speaker you got instead.  But even if you have another car you'll probably find yourself in the Z3 whenever you have the choice.

The good things about this car are easy to list.  It looks incredible, it drives great (even the 1.9), and it's pure convertible joy.

But I should also tell you all the bad things.  You already know it's small.  My Z3 is just coming up to 50,000 miles.  It isn't showing much wear other than a few paint chips on the nose, but there is usually a squeak lurking somewhere.  You'll feel every pothole, although BMW has softened the rear suspension on the newer models.  And the cabin is outfitted in some pretty cheap plastic, including the ridiculous fog-light switch.

Would I buy another one?  Maybe as a second car, but the Z8 is out soon.  Hopefully it will be everything the Z3 is and more: more space, more luxury, and more quality inside.<br><br>
