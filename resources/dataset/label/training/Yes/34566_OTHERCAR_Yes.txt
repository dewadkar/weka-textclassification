                When this vehicle was put in front of my face I was very amazed as in how good it looks.  I wanted a Nissan 300ZX but when I saw this I said to myself this has to be mine.  To me it looked like a Viper j.r.  If I can not have the real thing now I wouldn't mind having a car that looks like it.  It was a nice black 95 Dodge Stealth sohc.  When I took it out for the first time out of the dealer I felt like gagging because of the power the car had.  I did not know it had that much power.  For it to be one of the weakest stealth it had power.  I love the smoothness it gave.The seats in front are comfortable, but the back is only for kids.  That is probably what I hate about the car.  I took it up to the mountain and it went up on pure 5th gear without any problems.  It felt like a ride going up and down.  I just remember a lot of Mercedes, Corvettes, Lexus's, and other sports cars trying to pass me up because my car looked good on that road.  Actually this car should be bought by people who like to just roll with there ladies and love to speed up quickly.  The people that shouldn't buy it are the people that do not know what they are buying. <br><br>
