            It still amazes me that this thing drives like new after 91k miles of New England weather, and being the car my sister and i borrowed from mom after getting our licenses.

Paint and body have held up wonderfully considering never seeing a coat of wax.  Following salt trucks in the winter has left the bumper and hood with hardly a chip or scratch- much much better than i can say for many other cars around here with that kind of mileage.  The panels and molding are all intact and as if it had come from the factory this morning.  Being a coupe makes for some large, heavy doors, but they still close with the same solid thud as always.  The spoiler is still in perfect shape also.  Despite salty and wet roads, no exhaust component has ever needed replacing.  The mag wheels show a little corrosion (and a couple spots where they've been curbed- must be my sis:) but i have some mag cleaner that should brighten them up significantly.  Even though the suspension is a little soft for my liking, there is minimal body roll and it has the ability to eat potholes and frost heaves without fussing.  Steering feel is good but not as much road feedback as one might expect out of a coupe (it is still a Camry afterall..)

The only time it's been to the doctor other than scheduled maintenance was for a faulty ABS sensor (not a cheap fix, however).

A bulletproof 3L V6 is under the hood which easily turns the front tires into a pool of rubber on command.  It could undoubtedly leave so called "larger more powerful" cars like, say, an 84 thunderbird wimpering away from the quarter mile.  My friend has a late 80's V6 Camry that just hit 250k and the car still goes like there's no tomorrow (you probably wouldnt even think there's a yesterday if you see him drive it).  Mileage in the low 20s isn't anything spectacular for combined city/highway.

The interior is well thought out and simple.  Absolutely everything works.  Important stuff like AC is still cold, moonroof never leaks (although there has always been a piece that pops out of place, rattling, until its pushed back in), and leather is barely even worn in.  It has been garaged most of it's life but there's no way you'd think any part of it's 8 yrs old.
