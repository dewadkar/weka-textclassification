            I have a 1999 ML320.  It is the base model (V6, electric windows), plus a sun roof and leather seats. It does not have electric seats.  It now has over 20,000 miles on it. When I purchased the vehicle, I compared it to all the other competition, to include the lexus, ford explorer, jeep, and toyota 4runner, and felt it was the best vehicle.  I still do. 

The handling is superb.  Even at over 80 MPH, the handling is still solid and car like.  There is no rattling or squeaking, even on bumpy roads.  The V6 is powerful enough that I still do not regret getting it over the bigger, thirstier V8.  I have towed a small camper without any difficulties, even on hilly terrain.  I haven't gone out on true 4x4 terrain, so I can't comment on that.  Hopefully, I'll get to do that one of these days.

The heater works very well...heats up quickly...often so hot you'd think you would get burned!  The AC works pretty well, considering the ridiculous summers we get here in Texas.  It's comfortable with the AC cranking (but we do have tinted windows, which help, I'm sure).

The space is good, but not perfect. An inch more of space (for the legs) in the back seat would be perfect, although it's quite good overall, and much more comfortable than most SUV's on the market.  With the back seats down, I was able to put a large treadmill inside without much difficulty.  However, with two child seats in the back, an adult in the middle will be a little cramped.  However, the seats in the back offer significantly more room than many other SUV's out there. With the seats up, there is plenty of room in the back cargo area for a double stroller and several midsize suitcases.  Folding the seats down takes some getting used to the first time or two, but after that it's not too hard.
All around seat comfort is excellent.


The controls are fairly good overall, although the radio controls are poorly designed.  One cannot operate the ratio by feel alone, but must take their eyes off the road first.  There are only 6 memory sets for AM and 6 for FM (most radios offer 12 for FM).  There is a weather band setting and tape deck.  For a 30,000+ car, the sound of the radio is not very good.  My Galant has a better sounding system than that.

Quality wise: no problems.  As stated earlier, no squeak or rattle after 20,000+ miles.  No mechanical trouble either.

A big negative is the Mercedes dealership.  They are very nice, but they'll sock you on costs.  While I got a good price on the car, I was stupid and got a hitch placed by them several months after I bought it.  They socked me over $400 and didn't even include the ball.  Dealers are bad, but I think Mercedes is the worst of all when it comes to sticking you in your wallet.   The nice thing is that maintenance checks are every 10,000 to 15,000 miles so that you don't have to go visit them too often.

Maintenance is free for the new Mercedes now, so this may not be a big problem anymore.



Addendum 8/30/01

The car is almost 2 years old now.  Still running like new.  No mechanical problems to report.  No rattling.

The dealer wanted to charge me $350 bucks for routine maintenance.  That is for tire rotation, oil change, and "inspection of all components"  GoodYear did the same exact thing for 30 bucks...

The back seat is wide!  Three infant/toddler seats will fit in the back seat (next to each other) without too much trouble...



April 2002:

The vehicle has about 35,000+ miles on it now...about 2 1/2 years since we bought it.  My wife and I still think it's a great car (SUV). With the back seats down, I have been hauling all types of stuff--from large treadmill to outdoor furniture, with ease.  That alone has saved us a huge amount of money compared to having the stores charge for the delivery.  

The car still drives like a charm.  The engine/transmission is smooth as silk.  Good power to get going.  Absolutely no rattles or squeaks.  We have not had any mechanical problems since purchasing it.  Paint/body is like new, except for a few chips from stones.  No rust.
