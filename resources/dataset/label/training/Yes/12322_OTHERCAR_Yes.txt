            When we bought this car I really didn't think it was a good idea.  I was pregnant with our second child, and I really didn't think that a three year old and a newborn were going to fit in this car.

However, we needed a second car...and I didn't see the point in two &quot;family&quot; cars, so I let my husband choose what he wanted.  We took advantage of a great finance deal that was being offered and purchased this car.

We wanted this car because it was sporty and different.  We love it because it is a nice &quot;extra&quot; car to have when we go out just the two of us!  Believe it or not...it's not so bad when we take the kids either.  Both carseats fit in the back seat.  There isn't a lot of room to spare once we get the carseats back there. But let's face it, two kids in carseats really don't need room, since they're not going anywhere anyway!

We love this car.  The gas mileage isn't bad, and it runs great!  We plan to drive this car for a long time!<br><br>
