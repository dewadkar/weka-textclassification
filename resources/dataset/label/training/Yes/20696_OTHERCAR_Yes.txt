            Nissan Pathfinder XE, 2003

More Power to the Pathfinder.


PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

If you are trying to tell the difference between a year 2000 model or a 2003 pathfinder just by looking at the exterior you will be pressed to find any difference between the models. To see anything different you have to look under the hood and in the interior of the Pathfinder.

Under the hood Nissan replaced the sluggish 3.3 liter, 170 horsepower engine of last year with a new more powerful DOHC V-6, 3.5 liter that will develop up to 240 horsepower and if combined with the 5-speed manual transmission you will add 10 horsepower to this already powerful engine.

In the interior of the cabin Nissan has also made some improvements. They have redesign the control panel and the center console, giving a more elegant look than the Pathfinder had in previous years.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

As soon as I opened the driver&#146s side door of the Pathfinder XE, I immediately noticed some changes. For one the interior had received a charcoal gray color scheme, this gave it a classier appearance than the lighter color of previous years.

As I climb behind the steering wheel and tried to find a comfortable seat position, I was please to notice that the model I was going to take out had an optional power seat system with memory. It did not take too long to find a very comfortable position.

From the driver&#146s seat in the Nissan Pathfinder, the all around vision is excellent. The exterior side view mirrors are adequate unless you intend to pull a trailer. If you do I recommend that you install over sized mirrors. If your Nissan does not sell them you can easily find a set in the secondary market.

Again from the driver&#146s position all the gauges are easy to see, more so with the new arrangement in the 2003 model and all the controls and buttons are within easy reach also.

The interior space in the front is adequate, while in the back the legroom at only 32 inches is a little thigh.

The Pathfinder XE comes with an excellent list of standard equipment: Including air conditioning, power steering, power windows and mirrors, tilt steering, cruise control, heated seats, AM/FM cassette stereo radio plus a CD player, luggage rack and alloyed wheels.

I was a little disappointed to read that a sunroof can not be added as an option.

The exterior:
The Pathfinder with its heavy-duty bumpers looks massive. The vehicle also gives the impression of power and strength.

The selection of alloyed wheel models to chose from is excellent.

The rear cargo volume is at 38 cubic feet and the towing capacity is at 3500 pounds is low for a Suv's.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Taking the Nissan Pathfinder out for a spin was a fun experience. I had the opportunity to drive mostly on the highway, even if it is mounted on a truck base the ride is still pleasant.

The changes Nissan did were needed and the new engine runs great.
