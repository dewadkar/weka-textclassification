            My husband has always had a jeep, so when we purchased a 1996 Cherokee Sport I was extremely happy.  We opted for the 4 door because of the kids and it being easier to get in and out of.  I love to drive stick, so I had to have the 5 speed.  It shifts very easily, and I didn't experience any of that &quot;bucking&quot; you sometimes get with a stick shift.

 Excellent pickup, no problem pulling out in traffic!  The 4 wheel drive on the fly was a very nice option, no more pulling over to put it in 4 wheel. WE live in an area that can get some pretty good snow falls, so I never have to worry about getting around in bad weather. 

 The interior was very comfortable.  We drive 5 hours to see my sister, and I was always very comfortable the whole ride.  I loved the cargo area, it is very roomy.  

The only things I could complain about are 1. the cup holder-they changed the design, it is now a little plastic thing that hangs on the side of the console on the passengers side and has a tendency to fall of if your drink is too heavy.  2. If you are using a child seat in the back-if you place the child seat in the center  your passengers have limited seating room on either side. 
 Overall I love my jeep and will certainly buy another one!<br><br>
