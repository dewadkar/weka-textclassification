            I bought this car from a College student with only 14,000 miles on a 5 year old car. As a recent graduate myself with a family I needed a reliable and economical car. I have since put on 110,000 miles on it and have had very minimal problems...If I would remember to turn my lights out I probably wouldn't have to replace the battery or if I would use the parking brake the mechanics wouldn't keep reminding me that I will one day have a major repair. As You can see I am very abusive of my vehicles, I have been known to take them 4-wheeling, (I am a past Jeep driver). I have had no problems that were not self induced although just recently the seatbelt censor for the passenger seat is going off whether someone is seated in it or not, most annoying.

The car gets great gas mileage any were from 32-36 miles a gallon. It has been very reliable in the winters both in northern Michigan &amp; Ohio. The doors freeze up in over night ice storms but I have always been able to get in through the hatch back. I have moved several times and have found lots of room to move coaches in it, I just wish a sheet of plywood would fit in the back. I now have sons over 6' tall and it is small in the back seat for them.  Road noise on the highway is a little loud but we just crank up the radio. It has tight turning radius. Seems to be a magnet for people back into it.

I have had several owners(strangers)of the same model car have similar positive experiences. I would highly recommend it for those that want reliability and inexpensive upkeep.<br><br>
