            I recently purchased this car a few months ago except for it's a GST.  This car has it all a sliding moon roof, power windows, power locks, leather interior.  The thing I like most about this car is its fast and looks sweet.  A few drawbacks to this car is how low the car is actually to the ground.  Going over dips and bumps in the road can get annoying especially with a stick shift.  Another drawback is the backseat room is you like hauling people but if you usually are just by yourself or with a friend is works out good.  The retail value on my car was 12,000 and I got it under 10 with 68,000 miles on it.  So if you look around you could get a nice car for under 10 grand.<br><br>
