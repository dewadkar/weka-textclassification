            The Nissan Xterra was everything I wanted, and didn't. I take exception to the "Everything you need, nothing you don't" ad campaign. The dealer was unable to locate a truck without the power package, A/C, and dopey things like micro filters, $179 body moldings and others which drove the price over $24,000. The truck itself is the best I've owned. Rugged, mannerly and sharp. The solar yellow paint turns as many heads as my classic Porsche. Great standard stereo/cd player. Unfortunately, Nissan has chosen an all-weather tire instead of an A/T, giving it poor snow and low-traction capabilities. I will need better tires here in Buffalo to find out the Xterra's true capabilities. A compass and weather radio would be nice for adventuring. I also plan to install a portable map GPS.
