Kodak DC5000  Zoom

Two of my favorite things are the outdoor and photography and combining the two is always a great pleasure for me. I have several 35-MM cameras for different kind of weather and situation, I even have one I can take under water. 

But when I started getting involved in with digital photography, I could not find a camera that I would risk taking out in the rough and tough place where I like to capture on pictures sometimes. 

After several months of research and shopping around for one, I did finally find one that I could take out with me to explore the outdoors, it is the Kodak DC5000 Zoom. 

THE PRODUCT

The Kodak DC5000 camera has a casing that is made of a rubberized protective material that will protect the camera against most hits that it will get when trekking in the various forest and rocky hills of Southern California. 

It is also sealed to protect it against the fine sandy particles and dust from  the desert landscaping which is definitely my favorite place to find subject for picture taking. 

I do find Kodak DC5000 the camera a little too big, it measures 5.5 inches by 3.75 inches but so far it is the only one I found that I would risk taking out there in nature. 

Kodak claims that the DC5000 shock proofing feature will withstand a fall of about three feet but they do not mention if it is on concrete or on a soft surface. The DC5000 is also supposed to be weatherproof and sealed preventing humidity and dust to penetrate inside. 

THE FEATURES

The maximum resolution is 1760 by 1168 pixels with a color depth of 24 bits. There is a selection of quality pictures. If you are looking for the highest quality you can set it at 12 frames if you are not too particular about the quality of the frame, you can set it at 36 and still get very decent quality pictures. 

The aperture range of the DC5000 Zoom is f/3.0-9.6, the resolution is 2.1 mega-pixels and the digital zoom is 3x and the optical zoom is 2x.

Port capability is USB and the camera is Windows and Mac compatible.

I have been using the Kodak DC5000 for several months and to date I am very satisfies with my investment  Aside from the fact that I find it a little to big, it does take some excellent pictures of the outdoors.

At this point and time it will not replace any of my 35 mm cameras, but every time I go out exploring I do take it with me and experiment with it.

It is a recommendable camera for anyone who like me enjoys outdoors photography.
