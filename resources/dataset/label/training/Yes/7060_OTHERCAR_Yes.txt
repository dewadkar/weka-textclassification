            The Fuji FinePix 4700, despite its awkward name, is a good high-end digital consumer digital camera. It uses Fuji's new SuperCCD technology to capture images up to 2,400-by-1,800 in size. This can generate up to a 4.3 million pixel file, certainly suitable up to 8-by-10.

The Fuji FinePix has several nice features, including a completely manual mode, for those snapshooters who want to do it all.

The camera is very lightweight, probably due to the fact it is powered only by two AA batteries, not the customary four batteries. I haven't experienced that much inconvenience with the batteries running out of juice, but I'm sure it will happen soon.(Fuji doesn't recommend using AA alkalines, because of the high power drain.)

The camera is on the verge of being a little too small. Most of the controls cannot be operated while the camera is held up to your eye, like a conventional camera. This can be a little awkward, until you get used to it.

The camera also comes bundled with some nice little features that make the camera even more useful. In addition to the usual array of image-editing software -- Adobe PhotoDeluxe - the camera comes with a utility to turn it into a USB card reader. That's right, the camera itself can work as a card reader for other SmartMedia enabled devices. (I have a separate SmartMedia card reader, but I could see where this could attractive to some users.

I like the little circular LCD read out, which cheerfully greets you with &quot;Hello!&quot; on power up, and &quot;Bye&quot; when you turn it off. All major functions can be accessed through the LCD and the few buttons. There are no cascading menus and such. This makes for very streamlined operation.

Another nice feature is the sliding lens cover, which drops into place automatically. After losing lens caps for my other digital cameras -- the cap for the Kodak DC 280 is impossible to keep on -- it's nice not having to worry about it.

Overall, the camera is a joy to use. I am accustomed to digital cameras that are designed similar to 35mm cameras but, with a little adjustment, the controls and actions of the Fuji FinePix makes it easy it easy to use. The sharp metal styling also makes it quite an attention-getter.

There are a couple of drawbacks to this camera. The zoom buttons are awkwardly placed on the back of the camera, so I am constantly smudging my glasses. (You can work around this by using the LCD display to compose your shots, but this decreases battery life.)

Also, as far as I can find, there's no auto-display of images right after you take them, like with other digital cameras. (If this function does exist, I haven't found it in the 100-plus page manual).<br><br>
