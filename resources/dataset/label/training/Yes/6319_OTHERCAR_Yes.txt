            The 1996 Dodge Avenger ES.  Its a relatively good car.  It has superb handling, but a bad turning radius.  Its got a smooth ride, but be careful, its low and the front air dam will hit a curb or something really easily.  Its kinda slow, but has a great passing gear, it goes from 60-105mph pretty quick.  Its response is a little slow.  The seats are very comfortable, but when i go to hit the brakes, the steering wheel would hit my knees, which made that kind of uncomfortable.  I have never ridden in the back, so I don't know about the rear seats, but my friends tell me its pretty decent, even w/ 3 of them back there.  Its got plenty of leg room and head room.  The trunk is nice, it's extremely large.  A lot of people seem to think it looks really sharp, and I agree.  I guess if you want a decent car that's relatively fast and decently quick, you could get this. <br><br>
