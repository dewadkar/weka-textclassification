            I wouldn't know about long-term pros and cons of this car, but let me say that I had very few complaints when we decided to take a little cross-country adventure last summer in the '99 Mustang convertible we rented from a local dealer.  Up until the new design came out I had zero interest in Mustangs simply because I hated the earlier look.  But I think we made the right choice.  We traveled a consecutive 28 hours - from Tennessee to Colorado - without one problem from this car.  Despite frequent back-and-forths between going covered or topless (the car, that is) it was always an easy transition.  I have driven out west before and in previous times experienced a drastic change in the feel of the drive due to the change in weather and especially in altitude; thats a pretty hard climb in a just a day and a half...still no problems from the car.  I would say the gas mileage was fair enough, though bearing in mind we were on the interstate 98% of the time (as that state trooper in Booneville MO would gladly attest to as he gave me a ticket).  And it will go fast as I had the pleasure of finding out on a deserted Colorado road as our 'Stang effortly cruised me up to 112 MPH and counting before I chickened out.  
The only thing I can really remember to complain about is the lack of room.  There were only two of us yet we had a hard time packing in our stuff.  Since the trunk was so miniscule we had to cram alot in the back seat which became a problem as we flew down the roads constantly annoyed by &quot;that sound&quot; in the back seat and wondering if we lost something back there in Kansas.  
All in all we had a great time during our 10 days with this car and I came out of it with a new and unexpected penchant for the new Mustangs.  It especially gets a thumbs-up for taking 1300 miles in ten days with such grace.  We can't say the dealer was quite as gracious, but hey...thats what UNLIMITED mileage is for right?<br><br>
