            We have been using the Mavica FD88 in our office for a while now, and we've been very satisfied with it. It has numerous advantages that make it one of the most flexible multi-purpose cameras around:

<b><i>ADVANTAGES</i></b>
<b>1. Saves on floppy disk</b> - I cannot emphasize how easy life is with a floppy. Many people don't find it as efficient: it is bulkier (thus the camera is bulkier), saving the image takes some time, and disk space is somewhat limited on a single disk. However, the positives easily outweigh the negatives: floppies are cheap, you can buy them even at the drugstore (when you realize suddenly that you are running out of space in the middle of your trip!), and most importantly every computer has a floppy drive!! It is much easier to use then any other storage device; even the most computer illiterate can use it. 

<b>2. Multiple sizes/qualities</b> - depending on your purpose for the picture, the camera allows you to take from mega-pixel pictures, to cut-down version to be sent through e-mail. Therefore, you don't need to meddle with photo-editor software to manipulate images.

<b>3. The 8x optical / 16x digital zoom</b> - We've mostly used the optical zoom; the quality deteriorates as you go into the digital zone.. However, even 8x is god-sent for simple tasks like taking a picture of a speaker without having to run around inside the room, or for leisurely scenery shots, or to catch that bird on the tree. This is probably one of the features that we've used the most. The zoom is extremely easy to manipulate and the on-screen indicator helps out greatly.

<b>4. Movie mode</b> - The camera allows you to take 15-60 second (depends on quality) movies with sound. Many people, including me, thought that this feature would be useless; what could you capture in 15 seconds anyway, right? You wouldn't believe how much a toy this has become! From capturing the squirrels and birds that come to our windows, to small pranks we play, from party memories to greeting messages we've put on our websites, this has been one of the favorite features of the camera...

<b>5. Quality </b>- Mostly the quality of the pictures are pretty good. Granted, it still cannot compete with a SLR camera, but I would say they are good for most purposes. We've taken close-ups of products for brochures, and group pictures for newsletters without any problems... Unless you take your photography very seriously, you should not have any problems at all. 


<i><b>DISADVANTAGES:</b></i>
<b>1. SIZE</b> -  As I said, compared to most other cameras, this one is somewhat bulky. You can't simply throw it in your business case or your purse and move around. 

<b>2. LCD PANEL</b> - From one aspect this is an advantage. An LCD panel is much more easier to use and helpful than a viewfinder. The LCD panel is quite large and has a brightness control. Inside buildings and in the shade, the LCD panel has been very precise and sharp. However, I've had a lot of problems trying to take pictures outside. With a little sunshine, the LCD panel becomes very hard to see and you end up taking shots blindly. One thing I would've wished for would be to have both an LCD panel and a viewfinder.


Overall, if you are looking for a general use camera, find the idea of taking short movie snippets intriguing, and don't mind a little bulkiness, I'd say go with it! <br><br>
