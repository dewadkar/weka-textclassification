            I bought a 1994 Bonneville SSEi in 1998.  This car was low mileage and in almost perfect condition when I purchased it and has been almost totally problem free since.  The only problems I've had with this car since I bought it was that it required a new alternator and it came equipped with a remote starter, that didn't work.  I had a new remote starter installed immediately after the purchase and it has been problem free since, and is a real asset since I live in interior Alaska and it's wonderful to be able to go out to an already warm vehicle.  I own two 4-wheel drive vehicles, a Dodge pickup and a Jeep Cherokee, but the Bonneville is about all that I drive in the wintertime.  This car not only is roomier than the others, and has much better head room, but it gets much better mileage (20+ in the summer and 15 - 20 in the winter), and the front wheel drive provides as good of traction in the snow as the 4x4s, except for right after a deep, heavy snowfall since it has such a low ground clearance.  The ride provided by this car is incredible.  Travelling on Alaska's rough roads is a pleasure in my Bonneville, whereas it is a chore in my 4x4s.  Other big plus's with this car are the wonderful stereo system, extremely comfortable seats, the quiet ride and it came with an air compressor installed in the trunk, which comes in handy here where flat tires are common and service stations aren't.<br><br>
