            I remember, last year, seeing the Scion xB featured in an import car magazine. The vehicle looked strange, boxy, silly, and, well, UGLY. Why, I thought, would anyone buy this, or even build it? Fast forward to 2 months ago, when I noticed a new Scion "area" in the local Toyota dealership. I walked in, curious. I saw the xB. And I fell in love.

Pictures do not do this vehicle justice.

One thing that took me by surprise is how small this vehicle is from the outside. pictures make the xB look like a bus, when it's actually about the length of the Toyota Echo or Corolla. Step inside, however ,and it's space, space, everywhere. The interior is massive, I can't even figure out how they did it. I'm 6'3", and am not only comfortable in the front seat (with the seat all the way back), but could not get my knees to touch the front seat when sitting in the back. This is the first car I have ever sat in where I could (in theory) comfortably sit behind myself. The speedometer, tach, and fuel gauge reside in a circular pod in the top center of the dashboard. This only takes about 5 minutes to get used to, and frees up the view directly in front of you, while making room for a few clever storage compartments.

Another deceiving feature of the xB is the way it feels on the road. While most tall vans and SUVs feel like a car on stilts, the xB feels just as firm and stable as a Honda Civic, with excellent ride quality in town or on the highway. Standard Stability Control and Traction Control mean it'll feel that way when the going gets rough, too. Both Scions (the xA and xB) share the Toyota Echo's 1.5L 4cyl. powerplant, which produces 108 horsepower. While the xB is by no means a "hot rod", regular driving is easy, although the engine gets loud at higher RPMs when driven hard. Wind noise is much quieter than expected.

"Scion" means "Decendant", but I think consumers will associate it with something else: Value. The xB's standard features list is impressive to say the least, boasting Antilock brakes, power everything, a kickin' Pioneer AM/FM/CD/MP3 stereo (XM satellite radio available), Air Conditioning, First Aid kit, and many many more. If you avoid some of the high-priced options ($299 for illuminated cupholders?), and you can walk away with one bargain of a vehicle: $14,165 with manual transmission, delivery and all. We're talking Hyundai Elantra prices here, folks, with Toyota quality in and out.

If you can find a better new car value, please tell me. But until somebody does, I'll be one of the first in line when Scion dealerships start taking orders for the southeast in Jan. '04. Make mine a black box. Good looks: standard.
