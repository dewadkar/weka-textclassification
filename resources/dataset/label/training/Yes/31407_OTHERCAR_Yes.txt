            I have had a 2 door Alero for going on two years.  The car has been very reliable and steady handling car in all weather.  I was attracted to the car by it's clean, yet subtle luxurious interior and the proven V-6 engine powerplant.  Overall I am happy with the car and use it everyday.

Cons: are that I have had it recalled twice due to GM problems with the glove box and the gas tank.  Also, I have had issues with paint peeling on the door frame, a problem with the passenger mirror falling off and the CD-player skipping on CD's at random due to vibrations from normal driving.

All are under warrenty and the service at the local dealer has been satisfactory.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a good value to get some form of luxury.  I average around 15k a year of highway driving and this car is comfortable and the trunk is a good size for my golf clubs, gym bag and room for more.
