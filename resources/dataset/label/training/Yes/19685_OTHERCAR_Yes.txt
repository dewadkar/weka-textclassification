            I've owned my Saturn 1999 SL for about a year and a half now... everything is great... it runs great; has great gas mileage... it looks great and I keep it in wonderful condition.

The only problem with the car is that when I am running the fan, without the AC on, this odor fills the vehicle.  I've had it checked out by the Saturn people twice.  They say that it is bacteria in the the air system.  They've cleaned it twice but the odor persists.  They say that there is nothing else that can be done for it.

I have resorted to running the AC at all times.  We'll just have to see how that works.

The only other problems I've had were with the door seals on the front passenger door and the seat belt on the same seat... these were both defective, but replaced under my warranty.

I recommend Saturns because they are inexpensive and reliable vehicles.  However, realize that you are getting what you pay for -- it's not a perfect vehicle by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>
