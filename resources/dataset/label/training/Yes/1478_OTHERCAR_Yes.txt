            Escalade really is a mildly modified version of General Motors' GMC Denali sport/utility, which is a posh version of the rugged Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon. Confused by all that? If so, you're not alone. It's getting harder to tell the players without a scorecard in the booming light truck market, which includes sport/utes, minivans and pickup trucks. Don't throw rocks at Cadillac because it has modified an existing truck and is selling it as its own model. After all, the big, plush Lincoln Navigator is just a dressed-up Ford Expedition. Handling and braking are acceptable for a full-size sport/ute. The ride generally is smooth, although there is no mistaking you are in a truck on some roads. Cadillac brought the Escalade to market in 10 months, which is a very short time in the vehicle business. It generally did a good job.<br><br>
