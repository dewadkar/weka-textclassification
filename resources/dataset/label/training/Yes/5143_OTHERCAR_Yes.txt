            I purchased this truck 12/99 after my previous truck was totalled in a wreck (wasn't my fault!).  This is the first new vehicle I have ever purchased.  After looking at the price of used 4x4 trucks (i.e. '97-'99) I considered buying a new one so I would have the full warranty, etc.  What drew me to the Dodge Dakota was that Dodge was offering 0.9% financing for 5 years on 2000 models.  Being a bank loan officer, I know how much money that can save.

I have to say that I've enjoyed the truck and have only had one minor problem.  The upper cushion in the back seat had to be replaced which the dealership did at no cost.  I really like the size of the truck, since most of my driving is around town, its easy to park and maneuver in tight spots.  My previous truck was a full size Chevrolet 2500 with a long bed.  It was a nightmare in a tight parking lot.  

I think the Dodge is one of the best looking trucks on the road now, even though I didn't care for them when they first came out.  The only add-on I have on the exterior is side-step bars and they make the truck look good but they are basically useless.  The truck doesn't sit high enough that you need them.  I got the club cab so I would have somewhere to throw all the junk I carry around.  Someone could sit back there in a pinch, but it has no leg room.  I would not recommend it if you think someone will have to ride back there with any regularity.  Go for the Quad-Cab if you don't mind less bed room.

My main gripe is the gas mileage.  I'm averaging 14/15 mpg around town and maybe its wishful thinking but I was hoping for 17/18 with the V6.  I find the V6 to be adequate but had I known the gas mileage I probably would have gotten the small V8.  It can't get much less mpg.

Overall I'm very pleased with the truck and would recommend it but would seriously think about the V8 if you like power or would be using it to tow a large boat or Camper.
