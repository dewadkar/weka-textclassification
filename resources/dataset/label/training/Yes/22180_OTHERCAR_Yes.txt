            If you are about to upgrade yourself to a new digital camera, or you want to be inside this little world of digi-pics, this is a good tool to start with some Pro features in a cheap pack, USB standar cable connection to your PC and a great resolution of 3.3 megapixels (real, non-interpolated)wich is much to say.

Even knowing that there are no pro lens inside this camera, the resollution is great compared to a 35mm optical camera, with it's 1/1.8 CCD you can really capture some details with it's macro mode from 30 to 40 cms and then creating a really cool effect of deep of field with it, adjusting the sharpness with 3 levels of sharp and several light conditions variables is a great chance to take eye candy pics.

the pics are 3:4 proportions, wich fits perfectly on your monitor and you can crop the pictures later on the included software to make really impressive prints.

The camera material is a little too soft, so you better get a case for it if you want it to last for a good while, and remember to have at hand a couple of extra batteries at hand, and if they are rechargeable, better!

when you are using the cam at it's best resollution you can only count on 8 to 9 pics with the internal memory, so if you plan to go outside to take really lots of 3.3 res. pics, you will need a 128 Complactflash memory to take up to 70+ pics.

I'm still amazed about the color quality of this camera, I don't know how they got to have this kind of quality with this cheap pack, but is amazing how you can capture so many datails and colors.

The technical facts are lots and they are really cool (in price terms) when comparing to a Canon or Sony cam (i.e. ) and you won't be regret of buying this camera, the color LCD is really handy, but it eats a lot of power, but you can turn it off anytime, so, no problem. The lack of an optical zoom is one of it's cons, but shurely you wont need it that much with the macro mode.

End word BUY IT it worth it!
