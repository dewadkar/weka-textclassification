                 We got our 1993 Isuzu Rodeo this past July because my husband's car cratered on the side of the road. My husband wanted a pickup so he could haul things to the junk yard, but I wanted something we could take the family in as I didn't want to just have one family car. If something happened to our Mercury able, we would be stuck! 
     This SUV is perfect for us. My husband and I have two kids and a dog. There is plenty of room for luggage, the dog, our kids in their car seats and even some toys to keep them busy. The only things we still need for it is a cargo net and cup holders.
     When we go on the highway it is nice to have some room to move around, however we have noticed if the wind is high we don't want to be in this vehicle. We tend to get shook all over the road so we would rather be in our Sable if the wind is high.
     Since buying this vehicle used with 100,000 miles on it we have had a wonderful vehicle. We have not had any major troubles with it. We have only had to replace the air conditioner switches (as my husband broke them) and do normal maintenance (such as oil change, tires replaced, alignment). This truck is very dependable and reliable. 
     We plan on having this vehicle for a long time to come.
