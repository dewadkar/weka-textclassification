            Looking for a good quality digital camera without having to spend $500 and up! The Fujifilm FinePix 2800 Zoom lists for $399 and can be found for as low $329 if you shop the Internet.

The FinePix 2800 is a 2-megapixel digital camera with a 6x optical zoom lens that can take images as large as 1600 x 1200, this will give you an excellent 8 x 10 inch color print.

This is an excellent looking camera that looks more like a 35mm camera than a digital camera when the lens is extended out. Though it isn&#146t very large and hardly weighs much at all at 13.8 ounces with the batteries installed. It measures 3.7 inches wide by 3 inches in height by 2.8 inches deep. 

<b>The Lens</b>
This camera has a 6X optical zoom lens that is equivalent to a 35mm camera of 38mm to 228mm. Most cameras give you a 6X zoom but usually 3X is optical and 3X is digital, I believe the 6X optical is a better choice.

It is an auto focus F2.8 lens that has a range in Macro of 3.9 inches to 2.6 feet and in the normal mode a range of 2.6 feet to infinity.

The Aperture ranges are F2.8, F4.8 and F8.2. 

Shutter Speed is Automatic at 1/2 ï¿½/1500 sec.

Sensitivity is Equivalent to ISO 100. 

<b>The LCD</b>
The FinePix 2800 Zoom comes with a 1.8-inch color TFT (62,000 pixels) LCD.

The LCD is used for photo taking and making all your adjustments to the camera.

You can view your photos on the LCD and magnify them as much as 5 times and scroll around the photo.

There is also a viewfinder for photo taking if you do not wish to use the LCD. It is a 0.55-inch 110,000-pixel color electronic viewfinder. 

<b>The Flash</b>
The FinePix 2800 has a built-in flash that has the following setting: Auto, Forced Flash, Red-Eye, Suppressed and Slow Sync modes.

In the Macro Mode the flash has a range of 11.8 inches to 2.6 feet, in the normal mode it can reach out as far as 9.8 feet.

<b>Resolutions</b>
There are three resolutions to pick from, 1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960 and 640 x 480. 

<b>Movies</b>
You can record your own movies with sound as long as 60 seconds at a time at 10 frames per second in the AVI format. The resolution is 320 x 240, which is small on the screen but the quality is pretty good. On the 16MB SmartMedia card included you can get about 94 seconds of movie action.

<b>Sound</b>
Sound is available with your movies and you can add up to a 30 second WAV. File to your photos. 

<b>SmartMedia Card</b>
The Fujifilm FinePix 2800 Zoom uses a <a href="/content_44580114052">SmartMedia Memory Card</a> for storage and comes with a 16MB card. 

<b>Other Technical Specifications </b>
Sensor Type is 1/2.7-inch CCD, 2.1 million pixels

White Balance

Self-Timer of 10-seconds

<b>What you get!</b>

<b>Overall</b>
Fujifilm FinePix 2800 Zoom is an excellent buy for anyone looking for a nice digital camera that will print quality 8 x 10 inch prints and cost you under $400.

I love the look of the camera and the feel of it, it fits nice and comfortable in my big hands.

 On the back of the camera is a DISP button for turning on the LCD and a 4-way selector to navigate through the menus. There are MENU, BACK and OK buttons for making your choice. 

On top of the camera is a dial for the power, camera shooting, movie shooting and playback.

I found the quality of the photos in the 1600 x 1200 resolution to be very impressive, they are clear and very colorful. When printing them on my <a href="/content_44425383556">HP PhotoSmart 1215 Printer</a> with photo paper they turn out as good as any 35mm photo printed on Kodak paper.

The only thing I didn&#146t like is they claim it will take photos from 2 to 4 frames per second, well I could only get at best 1 frame per second which is still pretty fast.

I recommend with this camera a 64MB or 128 MB SmartMedia card and 8 AA Ni-MH batteries and charger.
