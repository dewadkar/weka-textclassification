            We recently broke down and bought a &quot;Program Car&quot; Dodge Grand Caravan SE, All Wheel Drive from a local dealer.  The reason for the purchase was the same as all other purchasers of mini-vans.  We needed more room to store cheerios and graham cracker crumbs!
Being new to this parenting game, I was crushed to give up our nifty little sports car, but as with so many males, the decision was not actually mine to make!
Always one with an open mind, I must admit I am DELIGHTED with the van.  The engineers have had years to perfect the functionality now, and that is just about what they have done.  Dual sliding doors are an absolute MUST!  Really, don't buy a van without them.  You will spend all of your time wishing you hadn't if you do.  AWD is nice piece of mind, but you actually never no it's there... unless it's snowing.  The only down side we have found to this vehicle is that the AWD is quite heavy and thus gets a less than frugal 15mpg/19mpg.  In all sincerity, having jumped over the line into the world of yuppiehood, I would keep the van even if we didn't have children.  The comfort, convenience, and over all utility are beyond any vehicle I have owned, and we have never had a minutes trouble.<br><br>
