            Ones I owned Corolla and I just loved it little gas almost no cost of repair, fast and computable. Highly recommenced. I lived in Iceland and am very good driving in snow. Never had to stop even though some of the jeeps did! So if you need a good car, and be practical buy yourself a Toyota Corolla, the most popular passenger car in Iceland.

The best of all is that Toyota has a relay nice service. You don't need to wait long time to get new nice equipments like in some other cars.

Hope to have you in the Toyota owner group, if you still not are, then consider buying one.
