            We own a 1994 Plymouth Grand Voyager LE.  It's our third!  (Two '88's prior to this one).  And can't wait for our finances to allow a 2000 model.
The 3.3 motor is gutsy and reliable. (112,000 on it now--and running strong!) We have had no major mechanical problems and routine maintenance costs have been affordable.  The worst &quot;tragedy&quot; we have encountered is replacing the lines to the rear heat and air conditioning.  The part was just under $100.00, a bit pricey but we've learned how much more comfortable the temperature for the rear seat occupants is when it works.

Our only regret is that Chrysler did not have the second sliding door out yet!  That has got to be the greatest thing that has happened to the mini van for young families.  A car seat for an infant or toddler is so much easier to get to from that door.  It is an option that I would pay great amounts for!  Based on resale figures I have seen it impacts the numbers very positively.

Being somewhat short, the drivers seat is easily adjusted to me, however it puts me dangerously close to the air bag.  My longer legged husband can not get the seat back far enough to be at arms length away from air bag.  <br><br>
