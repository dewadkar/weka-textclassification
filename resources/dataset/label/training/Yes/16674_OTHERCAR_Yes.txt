            My wonderful little Ford Aspire blew some more bearings.  Actually, it was more than that and my husband said enough.  It was time to look for a newer car.  I was crushed because I really liked my little car but with our youngest son, 15 years, we went off to look at used cars.

I think I got out voted the minute I said that I wanted something a little bit bigger.  My son wanted a little truck which my husband and I vetoed.  Then, they saw the mid-size station wagons.  My son was already planning how he could put all his race gear and still bring all his friends to the bike races.  My husband was helping him.  Without even opening the door, they were asking about prices and financing.  

Before they could buy, I reminded my husband that we had to go get our daughter from school.  She's 17 and drives too and should have a say in this.  

Her first thought was &quot;A Station Wagon??? No Way!!&quot;  Then she saw this Sable.  Okay, not bad.  This wasn't what she thought it was.  Much classier than the old fashion station wagons.  Then, her brother starts about all the stuff that they could fit in it and how they could save gas money by not taking the big truck.

Finally, we get in.  My daughter and I can't see the hood.  We're short and the hood has a bad slope.  You can't tell where the car ends.  Not good for a beginner driver like my daughter.  However, there are more gadgets and dodads.  My husband's in love.  I'm still not sure.  My daughter is with me and my son with my husband.

This really isn't a bad car.  It has power windows and door locks that the driver can control.  The side mirrors are adjusted by a switch by the driver.  No more rolling down the window and sticking your arm out.  The rear window not only has a wiper but has a cleaner dispenser.  The radio is nice and has a cassette player.  Lots of speakers throughout the car.  The very back, where my son was planning on throwing his race gear, actually can fold into another seat giving this car the capabilty of seating 8.  There is plenty of leg room between the passenger seat and the front seat.  The driver's seat has lots of adjustments: up, down, back, forward, straight, tilt and lumbar support.  There is plenty of power to get out into traffic.  

The dealer is letting me borrow  this car until I either get my poor little car fixed or the credit union tells me my loan has gone through.  We have the world's best car dealerships in St Mary's County, Md.
