            This car is a blast to drive!  From its' marvelous engine to its' finely-tuned suspension, the GS-R loves to be driven and driven hard.  It is a pleasure to drive this car on a daily basis.  The engine is truly amazing: it is a 1.8L normally-aspirated (non-turbo/-supercharged) 4 cylinder engine that produces 170 horsepower and redlines at 8100 RPM!  It's hard to describe the pleasure of taking an engine up over 8000 RPMs.  The transmission is also very nice, having short throws and a clean feeling, with ratios perfectly suited to keeping the engine in it's &quot;sweet spot&quot; between 5600-8100 RPMs (VTEC mode).  The great thing about this engine is that it's perfectly docile for around town driving.  Dr. Jeckyl only turns into Mr. Hyde when you rev it up high.  The handling is outstanding, especially if you do what I did and put some better tires on.  The stock tires are all-weather ones, which you can always keep around for the winter if needed where you live.  I recommend going up one size to 205-55-15's (V or Z rated), which fit fine on the stock rims and greatly improve the handling.  The car is great for everyday driving, but the real driving pleasure is found on a winding mountain road.

As far as driving comfort is concerned, the GS-R is great (unless you happen to be over 6 feet tall and sitting in the back seat).  There's plenty of room up front (my 6'4&quot; brother fits fine), the seats are comfortable (the driver's side adjustable lumbar support is really nice) and supportive during hard cornering, and all the controls are in the right place (except the horn, which you honk by pressing two small buttons on either side of the steering wheel.. really my only gripe with the car as they are hard to find sometimes, especially while you're turning).  The instrument panel is clean and easy to read (white on black).

Another big plus is the amount of cargo space, which is surprising for such a small car.  There's a large trunk and you can even remove the rear deck and fold down the rear seats for some serious hauling.

The GS-R is also surprisingly economical.  It gets 25 MPG city and 31 MPG highway.  I think the worst mileage I've ever gotten is 23, and that was a result of keeping the gas pedal near the floor through the entire tank.

Reliability has been great...  I've had the car for over 4 1/2 years now with no problems.

I drove lots of other cars (Eclipse GSX, Camaro Z-28, etc.) back when I was shopping, but I found the GS-R to be the most fun.  If you're looking for a sports coupe, you must drive this car!  (Be sure to get a young salesperson and find a winding road!)<br><br>
