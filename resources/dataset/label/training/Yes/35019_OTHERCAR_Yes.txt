            The Isuzu Hombre is a lot of fun, though I wouldn't use it for &quot;SUV&quot; type escapades. This is a reliable, inexpensive piece of equipment that looks good and has more hauling space than I'll ever use. 

The truck was pretty much purchased over the web through isuzu.com. It was the most pleasant vehicle buying experience I've ever had. We also looked at the GMC site and the Chevrolet site to comparison shop between the Chevy S-10, the GMC Sonoma and the Hombre. The Isuzu site was the most responsive - I heard back within 8 hours. It's a year later, and I'm still waiting to hear from Chevy. The Hombre had a lower price for comparable features, AND a 60,000 mile warranty as opposed to 36,000 for the S-10 and Sonoma.

Generally, the Hombre handles like a truck. The suspension is tight, and the turning radius is a little wider than I expected. Mileage is fine when you're not running the air conditioning (which by the way is extremely efficient). The four cylinder engine is moderately responsive, but I wouldn't try to race with it.

All in all a good buy that delivers everything I expected.* Transportation with hauling ability. All for about $12,500

*Since the big nor'easter went up the East Coast this past week, I think I should add that the two wheel drive version of this truck is good for nothing in the snow. Oh well, another lesson learned in life.<br><br>
