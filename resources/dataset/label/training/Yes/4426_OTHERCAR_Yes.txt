            This car is quite a step up from my previous tin can, a 'Toyota Tercel.  The Golf is quiet, fun to drive, and the stereo system  is great. Remote control locks seem like an annoying affectation when other people use them, but now I wonder how I lived without beeping the car locked from ten feet away (and beeping it again, just to make sure...and again...and...)

The two door has an ingenious little seat popping device that allows the seat to pop completely up, allowing you to extricate annoying back seat passengers in seconds. Even my parents managed to climb out of the back seat quickly, and it takes them years to do anything. 

This is a nice little car, probably the best nice little car. It's easy to park, despite being much wider than most compacts. The design is nice, despite the gimmicky cupholder, which is square and requires at least two hands to use (and which makes it impossible to put CDs in). The car is spacious, and you'll need a passenger to hold your soda!

Other small grumble: this car has a huge blind spot, and part of the seat back (the middle part) makes little squeaking noises and feels like it's stuffed with cheap newspaper . You'd think for all the money they spent doing market research to decide that the car needed to look more opulent, they could've designed a better seat. 

Also, we wanted cruise control, but it wasn't available in a two door.
