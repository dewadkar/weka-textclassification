            Ten years ago, when Saturn opened its doors, few would have expected that the new company would be able to compete with the import cars that dominated the compact and subcompact world. Well, by designing a reliable, value-priced car, and a friendly hassle-free atmosphere in their dealerships, they not only survived, they changed the automobile industry.
Thanks to the reliability and lower cost of their vehicles, Saturn has a fiercely loyal customer base. Their problem in recent years has been that many of those customers had outgrown the compact car, and were looking for a midsize car. As one Saturn owner put it:  Year after year, I visited the Saturn showroom and asked, &quot;So, do you have a bigger car yet!&quot; Year after year, the answer was, &quot;No, not yet.&quot;

Those customers had little choice but to buy a Honda, Ford, or Toyota. Now, at the beginning of a new century, Saturn has the daunting task of taking on some of the most popular vehicles in production today- the Toyota Camry, Ford�s Taurus, and the Honda Accord. 

Enter the new, bigger Saturn L-Series. Now car buyers have two more choices, the  LS Sedan and LW Wagon. 

How good is the new Saturn? Were they able to design and produce a car that can compete in this group? We think they did very well. The new Saturns deserve to be taken seriously by car buyers who are looking for a midsize car.

The L-Series may not turn heads with its understated styling, but it is sure to convince a lot of buyers with its features and price. Under the hood, you�ll find either the peppy new 2.2-liter balanced-shaft 137 horsepower 4-cylinder DOHC engine that will also be used soon in other GM cars, or the 3 liter 184 horsepower DOHC V-6 that is also used in the Opel Omega, Saab 9-5 and Cadillac Catera. 

Driving the car, whether it�s the standard 5 shift or the automatic 4 shift is fun! It may be made in America, but it kept much of its European pedigree. We were more than pleasantly surprised on country roads and highways. It smoothes bumps, takes corners and accelerates in an almost sports car fashion.

Your family will find the interior to be very roomy in comparison to the other cars in the group. Front leg room and head room are excellent. Rear leg room is a little cramped. The large bucket seats are more comfortable than the old Saturn seats, and four adults can easily take a trip in the L-Series. One of the comments we heard often from passengers was, &quot;Are you sure this is a Saturn?&quot;

The dash is clean and easy to understand. It only takes a few minutes before you are completely familiar with the buttons, information lights, and gauges. Placement of the controls makes it easy for the driver to make on-the-fly changes.

The 60/40 split folding seats allow you to expand the trunk's over 17 cubic-feet of cargo space.  The LW wagon, has over 29 cubic-feet of space which expands to over 70 cubic-feet with the seats down.

One area that Saturn has really improved on is the noise level of their L-Series cars. The S-Series cars were known to be very noisy, but that is not the case with the L-Series. The V-6 engine runs very quietly, and the 4 cylinder has only a slight &quot;buzz&quot; when you accelerate. The cabin is well sound-proofed - only some wind noises on the highway. Even the fan blows quieter that the fans on earlier Saturns.

There�s no question in our mind that the Saturn has earned its place among the Accords, Camry�s, and Taurus�s, but will it have any features that will allow it jump past the competitors? Our answer is definitely, &quot;Yes!&quot; After you�ve looked at all the features, test-drove the various cars, and checked-out the dealers, there is one very important difference: the Saturn L-Series costs a lot less! The base LS sedan starts at only $15,450, the LS1, at $17,190, the V6-powered LS2 model starts at $20,575, and the LW wagons start at a base price of $19,275. 

We think the Saturn L-Series will give the other mid-size family cars a real run-for-the-money. Your money that is! 

Now, what can we do with that couple of thousand bucks we saved? Kid�s college education? Trip to Orlando? Pay off some bills?  Wow! This is really fun!
