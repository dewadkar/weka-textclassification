            I have sold quite a few different makes and models of vehicles.  Anything from Ford, Lincoln, Mercury; to Honda, GM, Chrysler, and Toyota.  It has been my experience that out of all the different customers I've had, and the different makes they've bought, the customers that drove away with the new or used Camry were the happiest.  I have yet to receive a complaint from someone who owns one.

While I sold for Ford, I would constantly see my former customers in our Service shop, not for oil changes, but for major repairs.  This really isn't a problem if you still have a warrenty, but for those who don't it can get quite expensive. 

Camrys in general are extremely reliable, and efficient.  I no longer sell cars for a living, so this really isn't a biased opinion.  I run an internet business now, and even in talking in passing to my internet customers, they agree that Toyota products exceed all others.  

Camrys also hold their resale value better that any other vehicle on the market. This helps keep you from getting &quot;Up-side-down&quot; which is a position that noone likes to be in.

I myself own a camry, (older model)and it has been the best vehicle that I've owned.  I bought it right after the motor blew on my 96 Dodge Intrepid, that only had 60K miles on it!  My advice, by a camry, not a dodge.<br><br>
