            I have a 1995 Toyota Paseo with automatic transmission.  It is a beautiful color, sort of a periwinkle blue - or a light "purple/blue".  I bought my car used in 1998 for 10,500, and it only had 18,000 miles on it at the time.  Almost 3 years later it has 41,000 miles and still running great!  I have yet to be stranded by this car.  

The Toyota Paseo is good on gas and very reliable - always starting in sub-zero winter temperatures, even after being left outside (no garage) all night in 50 below windchills. 

And in my opinion, this is the "cutest" car ever made.  No matter the color, this car catches my eye whenever I see one.  Since they changed the body style in 1996, still cute but they "ruined" the back end of it, I was so lucky to accidentally "run into" this car one day while I was on a walk.  It was up on a pedestal at a used car lot.  

I would recommend this car, although they don't make even the revised model anymore, I bought mine used...and I'm very happy with it.
