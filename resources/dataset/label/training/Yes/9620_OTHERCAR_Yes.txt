            This car is great.  I am so glad I bought a Toyota.  This is the best car I have ever owned.  I recently graduated from college and was looking for something fun and sporty.  My sister is looking into buying one too when she get out of college. I looked at several different models before deciding on a car and I have absolutely no regrets.  I have mostly good things to say about this car.

I leased the 2001 Celica GTS wit a manual transmission from my local Toyota dealership.  I knew as soon as I took this car for a test drive that I wanted it.  Mine is black and has a spoiler, alloy wheels, and a power sunroof.

This car offers exciting, stylish looks with great performance.  It has a very peppy 180 horsepower 4 cyl. engine that really moves.  It feels like I am in a mini racecar.  With little added features like the racing pedals and the six speed transmission.  I didn't have to sacrifice fuel economy either.  The last thing I wanted to spend more money was high gas prices.  I do about half and half highway to city driving and I average about 31-34 miles per gallon.  On long trips I put it on cruise control and get more than that.  My friend bought a Ford Mustang and he claims to get about 22-25 miles per gallon on a good day.  Also, I can out accelerate him off the line and he supposedly has a more powerful engine.  I think my car handles turns better than his car too.

The stereo system sounds great too for a manufacturer's system and it comes with an in dash CD player as well.  It won't blow any doors off if that is what you are looking for but it does enough for me.

Also, I love knowing that my car will start every mourning and doesn't have to be in the shop all the time for recalls like some other cars.  I have heard nothing but good things about the quality of Toyota's.  It has one of the longest warranties of the cars I was looking at too.  The powertrain warranty is 5yrs/60,000 miles.  The Celica is also very easy to maintain.  Oil changes at 5,000 miles instead of at 3,000.

There are very few things that I don't like about this car except that it is hard sometimes to see out the rear window with the spoiler.  Also, when there is more than two people in the car it gets a little cramped, but that is expected in a sports car and the head room in the back seat is a little tight.  Other than that this car is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for an affordable ride that looks good.
