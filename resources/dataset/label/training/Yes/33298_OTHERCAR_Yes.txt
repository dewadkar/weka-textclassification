            I leased a Forester the first month they were out &amp; I still love it!!!!  I know we were taking a chance, but as you can see, our chance paid off.. It is one of the highest rated vehicles going!  It drives beautifully &amp; I haven't had to have anything done to it other than regular maintenance.  I'm a little bummed out that our lease is running out in September.  We got a great lease promotion, so our residual value will be too high to make it worth it to buy it.  I would love to keep it... there is only one downfall in my opinion;  it could be wider... as of now, with two toddlers, we can only fit 4 people... having two car seats in the back does not allow for anyone else to sit in back..  other than that, I love it!!!<br><br>
