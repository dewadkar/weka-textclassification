            My husband was involved in a pretty bad car accident, back in 1997.  He was crushed, and airlifted by helicopter to a trauma center.  His vehicle was totaled.

When it came time for me to renew the insurance on my 'trans am', I got canceled, because my husband was on my policy.

What should I do?  No choice, trade it in for another car.  We decided to go for a mid size car after losing his station wagon.

In the parking lot of the dealership was a <b>1994 jet black Pontiac Grand Prix</b>.  It looked brand spanking new.  A little high on mileage 35,000 miles, but just what I wanted.

Power steering, power windows and doors, air conditioning and cruise control, which are all a must for me.

The interior is light gray and in perfect condition.  It is called a 6 seater.  Three normal size people can sit okay in the back seats.  However, I would doubt if that were possible in the front.  I certainly have not tried it.

It is the four door model, which always makes life easier.  Whether it is for the comfort of passengers, or purely to lay items on the back seats.  I have plenty of leg room, when driving or being a passenger.  Even the back seats have sufficient room.

The air conditioning is almost immediate.  This is great living in Florida.  In my husbands vehicle it takes far longer to kick in.

The stereo system is excellent.  I only need it on a quarter to get a great sound, with more than enough volume to keep me happy.

It really accelerates well.  No, I do not have a heavy foot, but normally I do leave most vehicles standing at the lights.

<b>My disappointments.</b>

I do not have rear windshield wipers on this model.
Unfortunately no heated rear window for problem weather.
This model has so much, but both mirrors are manual.  I did not even realize this until after I had purchased the car.

Yes, I am happy with my car.  It rides well in most weather conditions.  Love the anti-lock brakes in our rainy season.

Who should buy it?  If you are in the market for a used car that looks good, rides well, this could be the one for you.
