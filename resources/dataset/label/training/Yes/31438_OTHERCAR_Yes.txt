            this is a full-featured 5MP compact camera that will work for a wide range of users. i compared this with the sony DSC-P10 and the minolta DiMAGE F100 and concluded that this had the best feature set in its class. 

the S50 is essentially a 'shrunk' PowerShot G5. there are some differences: the G5 has a flip-out LCD which is very cool and quite practical, a 4x zoom lens, and a flash attachment. otherwise, the S50 provides almost the same level of manual control as the G5 in a smaller package. if you want point and shoot capability but want the flexibility to be more creative when you want, this camera should be on your short list.

pros: 
- excellent resolution from a small lens - 5MP power!
- 3x optical zoom, 4x digital
- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail 
- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours 
- allows control over cameras internal processing algorithms - saturation, tone, sharpness
- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)
- compact and lightweight, considering this camera's capabilities (4.4 x 2.3 x 1.7 in, 11.1 oz)
- excellent build quality - solid 'brick like' feel - no creaks or rattles and a good positive feel to external controls
- nice metallic black finish - i definitely prefer this to the silver finish of other compact cameras
- the LCD monitor is also big (1.8") for this class of camera - gives good live preview and review even in well lit situations
- shooting priority play mode (a half-press of the shutter release always returns to shooting) 
- excellent range of manual controls 
- fast shot-to-shot times
- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera
- the manual focus has magnified loupe and ruler readout 
- flexible continuous shooting modes (buffer after processing) 
- RAW file format maintains 12-bits of data 
- ability to turn JPEG shot into RAW during record review 
- Compact Flash Type I/II and official Microdrive support 
- voice annotation feature 
- invervalometer (time lapse capability) 
- AF assist lamp works well 
- USB connectivity 

cons:
- average macro performance 
- vignetting at wide angle and maximum aperture 
- nine-point AiAF not available in P, TV, AV, M or C exposure modes 
- average flash performance 
- the four-way jog dial is not easy to use - pressing "SET" takes practice
- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery/CF compartment 
- lens slow at telephoto (F4.9) 
- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom 
- limited apertures at telephoto 
- zoom controller does not have enough steps / multiple zoom speed 
- some barrel distortion at wide angle
