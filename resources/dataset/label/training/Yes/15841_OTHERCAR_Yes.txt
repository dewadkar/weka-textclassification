            The Sony P31 is a very easy camera to use. As I stated in the title this is a snap and download camera. There are many options to play with and the menus are easy to use. 
This camera comes ready to go. It comes with a USB cord for downloading to a computer(plug and play), and a video cord for showing slide shows direct form the camera to the TV(this comes in really handy when you are on trips and want to share your pictures). If you have a Sony computer with the memory stick slot you can also take advantage of just putting the stick in the computer and quickly download them to your hard drive. 
I like the how the camera operates. It has many good features and the menu is easy to learn and utilize. There are also advanced options to select before taking the picture. The LCD screen makes viewing the pictures you have taken very easy. 
One feature I like is the power save option. It makes the LCD a little dimmer when the power save is on it saves on battery life. This camera is has a very good battery life. It also comes with rechargeable batteries and a charger for them. 
Besides the actual camera use the camera is very user friendly. changing batteries is very easy with the slide of a button. Then Memory stick also is very easy to change if you need to. I bought a 64MB card at 640 x 480 I can take over 350 pictures with out having to change the stick. The use of a DC cord and video and USB cables are easily accessable. 
One thing that this camera lacks is optical zoom. The digital zoom is good but optical is always more clear. Like any other camera it takes a little time for the flash to recharge after a picture is taken but this only takes about 3-5 seconds. 
I really like this camera and would recommend it to every one who is looking to take good quality pictures and easily put them on their computer. It may not be a camera for a professional photographer but in my opinion it is a great camera.
