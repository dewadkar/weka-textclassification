            Hey, what can I say negative at this point? I finally got a sports car. I fell in love with my cobalt blue Tiburon when I first saw it at the dealership. I test drove the other car I was interested in, a Ford Focus which drove ok, but the Focus got put out of my mind once I got behind the wheel of the Tiburon. It had guts, it felt solid, it was responsive. What wasn't there to love about the car?
I spent the additional $1700 or so more to get the top of the line model, which included the leather seats, sunroof, upgraded CD/cassette stereo with six speakers etc.
I ended up buying the car for $400 over the invoice price.
I've read some of the complaints about the mirrors being too small, and the spoiler affecting the view out the rear, but it all works ok for me. I will agree that the cup holders are in a bad place.
I don't have any complaints with either the buying experience, or the car. 
I feel good about the warranty offered with the car. I don't think there are any better. I hope I don't have to take advantage of it very often.
You owe it to yourself to at least take a test drive before making your final decision.
