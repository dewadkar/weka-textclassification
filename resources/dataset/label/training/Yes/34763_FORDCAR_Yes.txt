            So it was time for me to get a new car.  I would take ANYTHING to replace the wagon I was driving.  You know, the hand me down from your parents that's about 10 years old? Yeah...that's what I got to drive.
Anyways...my parents and I went down to the Ford dealer and started looking through the lots at the cars.  I went up to the showroom, and there it was.  My future baby car!
I've loved my ZX2 since I've bought it.  It was affordable, it gets me from place to place safely and it uses barely any gas in the whole process.
It's perfect for a college student like myself because the upkeep (gas) is relatively inexpensive.  It's never had any problems other than having issues getting into reverse.
If you're thinking about buying this car, get it with all the options inside, like a power package, etc.  Don't get a CD player, you can save hundreds getting one after market.  Oh...and get a manual transmission.  That's THE only way to go with this car.  I tried test driving the automatic, and it was way too sluggish for a car that really does not have that much weight to pull around.  
If you're a parent looking to get a car for your kid, this is a safe car.  I've been in one accident where a lady slammed into my side and cost about $4000 worth of body damage, but I was OK.  
As far as space goes, the trunk is actually rather ample.  The backseat is great for putting stuff in, but not your friends.  It's near impossible to get out of the thing from the back!
Overall, it's a cute, zippy, efficient car.
