            Nikon has it bagged. This is a great camera for the novice. I was helping my mother buy a digital camera for her business needs. She is a non-tech person, and my digital camera (canon g3) would intimidate her. So I showed her the Coolpix 3100 on the Nikon website. She thought it looked fine and we bought it (sight unseen). Her criteria were pretty simple: compact, easy to use, reliable, good enough quality.

When it arrived, she was amazed at how small it was. Folks, this is a small camera. It will easily fit into a shirt pocket or purse. We did pick up a Lowe Pro Z5 bag just to protect the camera from scratches.

I'm not going to give you all the details of what this camera has. You can see that in a number of other reviews. What I will tell you is my experience from using this camera versus my Canon G1/G3 (I have both) versus my traditional film camera (Canon Elan II with Tamron 28-200 zoom, vertical grip, etc.)

<b>WHAT I LIKED</b>

First, did I mention that this thing is small? Oh yeah, I already did. The main points that I'll cover are: ease of use, and quality of images.

How easy is the 3100? Quite easy. There are several "scene" modes that allow you to get quite decent photos in different situations (night mode, portrait, scenic, etc.) and they work quite well. The flash works well enough within the limited range it was designed for. Downloading is as easy as connecting the cable and clicking on a button or two. 

Playing back images is especially easy. You don't need to switch modes, as many other camera require. After taking some pictures, just press the playback button and the last image appears on the screen. You can view forwards and backwards and just by pressing the shutter button half-way down, it'll automatically switch back to the live image. It's really simpler than I can describe.

The menu system is ok. Most of the functions on the camera are hidden in the menus, which you access with a menu button. Once pressed, the main menu shows up on the LCD. You navigate through the menus with a 4-way arrow pad. Easy enough. It works, without putting many complex buttons on the camera.

<b>IMAGE QUALITY</b>
Pincushion, barrel distortion, chromatic abberation... Quite a few people actually like those disposable cameras with the plastic lenses. Let's say that this camera is better than those. 

Really now- I took a sample photo with the Coolpix 3100 and my Canon G3 just for comparison. They were taken about 15 seconds apart, standing at about the same distance from the subject, both using "full automatic".  My G3 had more detail due to the 4MP vs the 3.2MP of the 3100. So to ignore the detail differences, I resized the G3 pic to the same final size as the 3100. I also needed to change the levels slightly (the canon g3 took a "brighter" picture).

The G3 seemed to have more "life" in the picture. A little more adjustments made them even more similar. But, it still seemed like the G3 took a more even exposure across the entire range (light to dark). The G3 also had somewhat deeper reds, while the Nikon had deeper greens. 

The G3 had a higher resolving power than the nikon. That could possibly be due to the Canon's much Larger Lens. This translates directly into detail on the prints. On the print from the nikon, you could see that the tree bark had some lighter spots, but on the G3, you could see that it was moss. (keep in mind that I resized the G3's image smaller, to match the size of the nikon's image)



As far as <b>limitations</b> go, there are a few.

1. No manual modes. There is no way to select your own shutter speed or aperature. When one gets more familiar and advanced with cameras in general, one is likely to explore manual modes because of the uniqueness you can get by changing the exposure.

2. No battery charger. I guess Nikon assumes that everybody throws away batteries. We ended up buying 4 "AA" NiMH batteries and a wall charger.

3. Can't find a way to upload pictures back to the camera. This is more useful than it sounds. Once you've downloaded all the pictures from the camera to the computer, normally you delete all the photos so that you can take lots more. Let's say you've taken and downloaded 200 photos. But you want to keep your favorite 5 photos on the camera so that you can show your friends. Nope. Nada. Can't do. Forget it.

<b>OVERALL</b>, I liked the camera. It was easy to use, especially for a novice. The quality of the image isn't quite the same as the Canon G3, but it would suffice for the novice.
