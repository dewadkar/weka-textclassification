            Wow. Never have I encountered a car that is made with such quality.
My 1990 Celica GT, bought new, is  now 11 years old and has over 313,000 miles - and has never given me a major problem. Ever. Simply amazing.
It's always been fun to drive - very smooth ride and very quiet engine. Sometimes I'd sit at a red light and wonder if it had stalled - that's how quiet it was. In the past couple of years it has gotten a little more rumbly as far as sound goes, but I still haven't had any major engine or transmission trouble.

The only problems I have had since buying this car were the A/C (there was a recall for that, so I guess that explains it) and the antennae. The antennae was the kind that retracts when the car turns off, and it started to get stuck and a little bent out of shape. Don't go into a automatic carwash with the antennae up - I believe that is what started to mess it up. But the antennae was easily and inexpensively replaced.

As a 2 door coupe, obviously you can't expect much leg room in the backseats. I wouldn't recommend this as a family car. But the seats are very comfortable for driving (cloth bucket seats) and riding in the front passenger side.

I've read a lot about the 2000 model Celica having interior that is easily scratched. Mine has been lightly scuffed in the past 11 yrs. I guess maybe the quality was lowered since the 1990 model? I will find out for myself, because I plan to purchase a 2000 model soon. Toyota has got me for life - Long live the Celica!!
