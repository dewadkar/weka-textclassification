            I recently purchased a 1997 Honda Del sol.  I have been looking all over for this cutie, and ended up finding one .... 350 miles away.  My boyfriend and I took a plane to Anaheim, bought the car, and drove it back.  Let me tell you it was well worth the plane ticket, and boring drive.

This car only has about 120 horses, but it weighs less then a ton so it zips right along.  The top comes off, the back window rolls down (along with the driver and passenger windows, obviously).  The bucket seats make it feel like you're sitting on the street, but that gives it even more of a sportsy feeling.

There are so many things you can do with this car too.  You can lower it, put ground control on it, rims, exhaust, a comando spoiler and it won't look over done.  Accessories make this car look even better.  

This car only cost me $12,100, and it drives like a $45,000 BMW. This the best car!

Well, she's dead. Yes DEAD! I loved her, and cared for her and she ran strong until the end. How did she die you ask? Well, some di(kwad in an Eclipse slammed into my car while I was parked at school! No note! Just $9,000 in damages! 

I still hold strong to my opinion. I am a very careless person when it comes to cars. I was going on about 13,000 miles since my last oil change, and it still ran great.. I still got like 25-30 MPG! 

Love the car, just don't park on the street. People like to hit it. :(
