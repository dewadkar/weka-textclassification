            This is the second Subaru I have owned and I know why , Its great on gas and handling around curves. I put on over 500 miles per week and the gas mileage is good. 
I live in the mountains with lots of sharp curves and the car handles the curves with out a problem and it does not feel like you are slipping off the road. 
I brought this car after test driving several other models and for the money it is well worth it. I also like the ease of putting a child seat in the back without feeling like I just went thru a major workout.
 The seats are the most comfortable I have been able to sit in. I have a bad back and with all the driving I do I needed something that was comfortable. The car is slightly higher off the ground than a some other cars making it easier to get in and out of. 
There are numerous cup holders and little pockets to stash all the papers and whatnots that I tend to carry around. My daughter is now looking at buying one for herself, and several friends after trying mine have purchased one for themselves. <br><br>
