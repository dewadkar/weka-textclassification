            Should a Woman purchase this size vehicle?

My wife needed a new vehicle for work.  (In our family there is my wife and 2 dogs only).  At time of the purchase, she had a Ford Thunderbird (1994).  She spends approximately 30 minutes driving 35 miles on an interstate one way to work daily.  We live in Northeastern Ohio (the snow belt area) where weather can change quickly without warning.

I wanted to find a vehicle that I would feel comfortable with her driving in the good and bad weather.  My wife does not miss work.  We visited GM and Dodge and drove sport utilities from each.  We brought a Ford Explorer home for a night.  I did not feel safe in the vehicle when I corner hard as I drove the car in my normal manner on local roads.

After keeping the Explorer for a day, we returned it and I eyed the Expedition on the lot.  I told our salesman that I would like to drive it. I told him I was not interested in the Explorer.  Of course he said OK and we took it for a ride.  My wife liked the way it drove and said she felt she was in total control within 5 minutes of her test drive.  She liked the vehicle very much.  The vehicle has automatic 4 wheel drive.  Her comment was, &quot;look, I never have to worry about when to use it or not.&quot;

I told her the Explorer would not get the fuel mileage we got in the Thunderbird, and this would even get less.  I also told her that it did not become safer in the snow going down the freeway at 65 miles an hour, it would take a lot more distance to stop and on ice, it would slide just like a car, but with more weight and distance required to stop or get it under control.  (My wife has completed donuts on the freeway before, but she has never had an accident.  I wish I could say that.)  

No more did this leave my mouth and deer ran out of the woods in front of us.  She hit the brakes, changed the direction, moved around the deer and said,&quot;it handles like a car&quot;.

I was nervous about the size of the vehicle and her comment was it is no larger then my F150.  Experience at this point has taught me to shout up and I did.

There is a great deal of options that I would not order such as leather interior, heated seats, third seat but she liked how it handled from her test drive.  Again, I relied on my experience to say &quot;OK&quot;.

I suggest anyone that has a member of their family traveling any distance as my wife does, will feel comfortable with the vehicle from a safety point of view.  The vehicle provides a great deal of protection in the frame and structure of the vehicle.  You pay for this protection in the initial vehicle price and constantly in fuel cost.

This vehicle is not cheap to purchase or operate.  We have never had to take it for anything but normal service (oil changes).  The Eddie Bower has options which can break and put your vehicle out of service (it has not happened to us at this point, one year of ownership). 

The 4 wheel drive gives my wife a comfort that only 4 wheel drive can give.  She handles the vehicle as a normal size vehicle.  She has only owned or drove a Ford Thunderbird, Pontiac Firebird, Ferro, Monte Carlo and her first new car, a Ford Mustang.

I am allowed to drive when we go out with others, I fine the vehicle to be as safe, handles like it should (within the speed limit) and gets a solid 15.8 miles to a gallon of gas.

Expensive to purchase, Expensive to drive (compared to cars).<br><br>
