            Becoming a new dad brings lots of changes. Sleep habits and the sudden need to carry duffel bags worth of diapers, bottles, and toys for even the shortest cross-town jaunt are obvious changes. But the change that hit me hardest was the need to change my driving habits. 

In my pre-dad days, I could drive whatever I wanted, and I did. I loved little cars, and at the time my wife became pregnant, I was styling around town in a silver BMW Z3 that I absolutely loved. Not long after the rabbit died, so did my styling. 

My wife <i>insisted</i> that there was <i>no possible way</i> that I could keep a 2-door convertible with no back seat when I had to take care of a baby. Cogent arguments about my urgent need for peppy 5-speed transmissions moved her even less than my brilliant argument about James Bond driving one that had machine guns behind the headlights. I was doomed to go car shopping...

Gods being the perverse sort of creatures they are, we were fated to find ourselves in  a Chrysler dealership one Saturday afternoon about 6 months ago. What drew my wife's eye was that bane of highways, the mini-van!  Oh, God, no!! To make matters worse, the fates conspired against me so badly that the salesman and his manager offerred far more financial incentives than my poor misguided wife could ever hope to pass by. Low interest rates, rebates, even the option of no money down.  

Well, after 6 months of driving a 2000 Plymouth Voyager, I grudgingly admit that it's not too bad (but I still want my Z3 back!!)

The van has tons of room, it's comfortable -- even in the back seats, it's well equipped, and it feels good to drive. 

Sorry, I'm not a mo-head, so I can't tell you much about the specs on it. Horsepower? Yep, it's got some. At least it manages to cruise down the highway at 70, so it's good enough for me. Peppy? Not hardly, but for a family suburban mall cruiser, I don't really care. 

We bought this van for its suitability for a family, and in that regard, it's proven perfect for our needs! Even after strapping in a car seat and loading a stroller or two in the rear storage area, there's room for 6 adults. Leg room is a bit tight on that 3rd seat, and when the seat is in it's rear-most position, there's not a lot of cargo space. 

The van does feel good to drive though. Shifting feels firm and solid, acceleration is somewhat sluggish -- but adequate, and braking is quite good (I try not to test it, but I've had no problem stopping the vehicle quickly when I needed to). I also like the generally solid feeling of the van. Doors clunk shut firmly when closed and nothing has jiggled loose yet.

Workmanship and quality are always important elements to me, and so far, the Voyager has proven acceptable to me. <i>But please don't rely on my opinion on this -- I have only owned the vehicle for 6 months</i>. Consumer Reports does not generally rate these vans as being especially durable, and I doubt that it will hold up for me as well as some of my other cars (see my epinion about the Honda Civic DX 4-door for a car that I regard as having great quality). However, given it's affordable price and the financial incentives that Chrysler offerred us to take the vehicle, I will forgive minor (not major) mechanical faults. Ask me again in a few years time and I'll give you a more experienced opinion about this vehicle. Chrysler does back the vehicle with a 3-year warranty, including a roadside assistance program, so if you ever do break down, they will (theoretically) send someone out to help you. I have yet to test this program, but I like having it since I plan for my wife to use the vehicle when driving our daughter around town.

One of the things that sold me on this van was it's flexibility. It's <i>very</i> easy to pop the 3rd seat out. Just push a lever and then roll it out on its wheels. This is how we usually use it since we don't carry many people with us most of the time. The captains chairs in front are firm enough for me and offer plenty of leg room (I'm 6 feet tall).

Base models include a V-6 engine, automatic transmission, power steering and brakes, air conditioning, and an AM-FM cassette stereo. Not too shabby! If you move up to the Grand Voyager, you also get a back door on both sides of the van, a luggage rack, and a few inches longer body. (Given the relatively limited amount of cargo space, this might be a worth paying for.)

Overall, I'm satisfied with the performance of the Voyager minivan. I am slightly worried about its record for long-term durability, but I expect that it will serve us well for at least a few years. In terms of comfort and space for the money, I don't think you can beat this van!
