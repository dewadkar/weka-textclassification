            I love my 1995 Saturn SL1! I blew the engine on my old '82 Pontiac Grand Prix and was in a bind for a car. My father loaned me his 1978 blue Impala and that just wasn't cutting it... 

My husband and I found our Saturn at a local used car dealer with a spotless reputation. Having only 12,000 miles and being less than a year old, we figured the car was a good deal. 

As it turns out, this car has been one of the best purchases we've ever made. The car is nearing 100,000 miles and besides the normal maintenance we've had to replace the engine belt and one of the wheel bearings is going out. Both of those repairs total less than $500. To contrast, my sister bought a new Chevy Malibu less than two years ago and it's been in and out of the dealer's shop so many times for various problems...

Being a small car, you can hear enough road noise, but it's not distracting or annoying. We've taken several trips of more than 15 hours at a time, and the ride isn't too tiring if you stop to stretch every so often. My only complaint is that the seats are a little small for my frame (I'm a 5'9&quot; lady). 

Our local Saturn dealer is very nice to deal with. Now at least four other people I work with have bought Saturns of varying years, and we're all very happy with them. If I had to replace this car tomorrow, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Saturn either of this model year or a new one.
