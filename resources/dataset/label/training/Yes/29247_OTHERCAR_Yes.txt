            I have owned my Blazer since the first new introduction of the revamped Blazer in 1995.  It's a black 2-door 4WD hot looking car that I have driven all over the country, from the desserts to the highest mountains on the west coast.

I bought this car for it's versatility...it's extremely sporty looking while providing an EXTREMELY powerful V-6 engine with kick ass tires that bring me wherever I need to go.  Not to mention it's EXTREMELY comfortable and ERGONOMIC..something everyone compliments me on when driving in the BLAZER.

There are some issues here though.  The the car is not as top heavy as other SUVs, and living in the mountains, I have tested it on all kinds of terrain.  The only problem I find is it can be a little light, and tends to skid out from the front when encountering ice or very slippery weather.  That was tested to the fullest the other night.

Three nights ago on a cold night's drive home, I was ascending the hills of western massachusetts, only to hit a huge, un-salted, un-sanded patch of BLACK ICE.  It's happened before, and the Blazer has maintained as well as one would expect for an SUV of this size.  This time, though, I skidded out in both directions, went in 180 degree skid out and ended up flipping the car.

Much to my joy, and the joy of my loving family, the Blazer lived up to it's motto, LIKE A ROCK, and with the help of good sense, MY SEATBELT, and the sturdiness of the BLAZER, I actually climbed out of the window with BARELY A SCRATCH.

Some people think the Blazer has a lot of faults, and I can name a few.  Those would include low visibility because of the sporty, aerodynamic design on the side windows of the 2-door vehicles, which makes it very difficult to see when changing lanes for highway driving.  The second thing would be the fact that the overhead console, with sunglass holder, fell out about every 6 months (something I believe they took care of in the past re-release of the newer Blazers).  The third VERY ANNOYING thing would be the back door.  IT SQUEAKS UNCONTROLLABLY when it's wet out.  I brought this to two different dealers over 7 times when the car was still under warranty, but it was never fixed.  Just one of those annoying little noises that eventually one can forget about.

Aside from those things, I loved my car dearly.  Now it is waiting to be destroyed as it was totalled the other night.  But the point is, I am HERE to write about it.

I guess I just wouldn't recommend the BLAZER for HARDCORE drivers who tend to dominate CURVY, ICY mountain roads in the winter.  It would be a GREAT vehicle for easier, less scary driving in the suburbs, though.

Overall, I give the Blazer 3 1/2 stars.
