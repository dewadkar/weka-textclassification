            Mercury ended the production run of the Mystique late last year, and mine was one of the last to roll out of Kansas City (I think they retooled the line for a small SUV or light truck). However, that means, if you can find one, you can get a great deal for a lot of car.
Mine is an LS, with standard power locks, windows, mirrors, moonroof; sport suspension with wider tires, 24-valve V6, standard leather seats and steering wheel, ABS, fog lights, air filter. The only things it didn't come with (and you couldn't order, because they no longer make them) were a CD changer and premium sound.
It is a lot of fun to drive, with a tight suspension and quick handling; steering is responsive; it's comfortable to sit in; gets reasonable gas mileage; has nice bright turn signals; and is smart lookin' (better than the comparable Ford Contour).
On the con side: no side air bags; unimpressive sound system; rather noisy in the rain, had to paint the replacement side mirror to match the car when someone ripped mine off; smallish back seat; no radio controls on steering wheel; and now that it's winter, the power antenna has trouble retracting on occasion.
All said, it was a better value than the Corolla, Jetta, Accord, Cirrus, Malibu: just $15,990, dealer cost (not including holdback). The features and options the Mystique included were comparable to much more expensive cars. I consider it my poor man's A4.
Final note--the LS is a much nicer car than the 4 cylinder GS, more power, better handling.<br><br>
