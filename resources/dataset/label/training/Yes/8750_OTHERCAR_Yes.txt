            This camera was my wife's &quot;Birth-Mas&quot; present this year (combining the two, birthday and Christmas) so I got a little better camera than I originally intended.  As a matter of fact, I was only expecting to see 2 megapixel cameras at this price.  When I finally got the camera home (after extensive handling and questioning at the store) I was pleasantly surprised to see some of the additional features described in the manual.

The camera has outstanding picture quality at 3.37 megapixels and provides plenty of storage with Smart Media memory cards.  Download of images is quick and easy with the built-in USB port.

Burst mode gives you 8 frames in a little less than 7 seconds to capture action and an Auto Exposure Bracket mode shoots 3 images with a slight variation in exposure for each one in difficult lighting situations.  An added bonus is the ability to shoot short video segments at 160 x 120 to 320 x 240 and 15 fps.  You can get about 5 minutes at the lower resolution.  With sound!

Oh, did I mention that it records sound too!  A seperate mode position turns the camera into a voice recorder for memos and such.

Some of the drawbacks include some functions that do not default back to original settings when you turn the camera back on which can lead you to trying to shoot landscapes in close up mode.  The menu/mode/settings- buttons operation is not terribly convenient or intuitive but can be readily learned.  The wide range of features makes this a longer task than might be expected.  The last on my short list is the time it sometimes takes to acquire focus and click the shutter.  This is sometimes caused by mis-settings on the camera (see above) and there is no explanation as to why the long delay.  Interpretation of all the flashing icons and colored lights is going to take some getting used to.

The plus side is the FANTASTIC images that it takes under some highly adverse conditions.  Close-up is supposed to be to .3 meter but actually runs to about 8 inches.  A wide range of flash modes, exposure times and f-stops from 2.0 to 5.6 add flexibility.  You can reset the effective ISO from normal to 2x or 4x and change the exposure by 1.6 stops either side of nominal for special effects.  They even have a funky, cone-shaped filter adapter so you can use standard 52mm filters designed for 35mm photography.

Add this to the capacity for up to 170 or more images, fast download, video, sound, and expandable memory and you have a real bargain for the dollar.

This camera is suitable for the advanced amateur or anyone wanting more image quality and willing to take the effort to learn the camera.<br><br>
