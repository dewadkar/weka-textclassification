            After finally getting rid of her problematic 1999 Chevy Cavieler, my sister went shopping for another sporty compact. After looking at various models of the Pontiac Sunfire, Focus, and other sporty compacts, she decided on a brand new Cloud Nine White Focus ZTS Sedan. The ZTS Sedan is the top-of-the-line Focus sedan, with unique standard features such as the 2.0L Zetec I-4 engine (130HP and 135 ft/lbs torque instead of the base model's 110HP and 125 ft/lbs torque), rear spoiler, and 16-inch alloy wheels (15-inch alloys available on the SE sedan). After having the car for about a year and many thousands of miles, this is our review of the Focus ZTS Sedan.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>
The Focus, with its high slanted roof, somewhat resembles the new VW Beetle. However, the Focus looks much more aggressive with its styling than the "tame" looking Beetle. The aggressive styling is probably due to the sharp  triangular headlights and taillights. The hood of the car slants down as to keep from blocking the driver's view of what is right in front of his/her car. The deck lid (in other words, the trunk) is set high like many other compact cars, and is squarely cut off with sharp, straight lines. The 16-inch alloy wheels and the rear spoiler look great on the car, adding a bit of flare and sportiness. However, if I could describe the unique looks of this car in a few words, it wouldn't be sporty or sleek, but different and eye-catching.

<b>INTERIOR</b>
The interior looks pretty roomy due the high slanted roof, but it certainly misleads you. There is enough room in the front to make it comfortable, but the rear seat is pretty cramped (especially when you seat three people back there). The front bucket seats are supportive and firm, which adds to the sporty factor. The quality of the interior is also exceptional; there are no squeaks or rattles to be heard. The single-CD stereo work perfectly and the sound quality is great. I did not like where Ford placed the power window/lock buttons, which is right on the side of the doors. I found it awkward and uncomfortable to use these controls, and wish Ford placed them in a more convenient, comfortable location. As said by other reviewers, blindspots are a problem on this car. The single-CD stereo work perfectly and the sound quality is great. Road noise is pretty loud and annoying when travelling at freeway speeds, as it is in any small, compact car. 

<b>PERFORMANCE</b>
My sister did test an SE model with the base engine and automatic transmission (she decided on an auto this time because she has young kids). It did not have good acceleration, and could barely keep up with traffic on long inclines (if you are to get a Focus with the base engine, please get a standard transmission). This is why she decided on the more powerful Zetec engine, as it had better acceleration and could actually keep up and surpass traffic on long inclines. It also has acceptable gas mileage, but not surprising for this engine. The engine has held up well with my sister's daily 90 mile trip to her workplace and back.

<b>HANDLING</b>
The handling of this car is great. It is easily maneuverable, and it hugs curves in the road like sports cars, even during wet conditions. The steering is responsive and quick. In snow, it is recommended that you get chains for this front-wheel-drive car. The OEM tires are wider than the base models and SE models, which isn't too good for snow-covered streets. The car isn't hazardous when it snows, but it does handle better and is more predictable with chains on.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
The pricing of this vehicle is pretty expensive; just under $16k. But if you look at similar foreign cars, it is in the ballpark and even cheaper than some cars. For the price, it is a great car and it has treated my sister very well. The car is recommended for those who want a sporty handling car with a cheaper price. Kudos to Ford!
