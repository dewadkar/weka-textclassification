            Jeep is the original and has the body of a tank.  I had a Jeep that went through anything and everything.  It has a high clearance and has a huge powerful engine.  It's inline six cylnder high output has more power than the V-8 engines that Jeep came out with for their Grand Cherokees.  The only Jeep that can surpass the cherokee's off roading capabilities is the Jeep Wrangler but that sucks when it comes to road driving.  They also tip over too easily, I know, I already have.  The cherokee is a smooth ride when it comes to the street too.  It's tires and wide enough to give you traction in the snow or mud but thin enough as to where you don't hear the loud hum on the pavement.  It's smooth on the bumps; as soft as a SUV can get and yet, it's suspension is tight enough to keep you rocking on the side of a mountain.  It climbs some pretty steep grades too.  It says up to 30 degrees but I've gone up more.  I've accidently hit a jump and got more than 4 feet of air and the tank, er... the jeep kept right on trucking.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good SUV that can handle a lot of stuff off the pavement too.<br><br>
