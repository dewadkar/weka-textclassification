            I have a 1991 Mitsubishi Galant with 165,834 miles.  My parents bought it for me, they said it would be a great first car.  I immediately noticed a tear in the foam on the driver's side seat.  Evidentially, this is a common happening in this model, two of my friends with the same make have the same tear.   

I also noticed that the black paint around the windows and on the windshield wipers had worn off.

These are the only cosmetic problems with my car.

Now, when it comes to driving, that little thing just goes!  It has plenty of power and I average 32 miles per gallon.  I have spent very little money repairing my car mechanics-wise.  I have had to replace the transmission and the engine computers and it had leaked some oil. Other than that, it just drives and drives!  

I think this car is a perfect first car and a good idea for college students.  You can buy one at a good price and they are very reliable. <br><br>
