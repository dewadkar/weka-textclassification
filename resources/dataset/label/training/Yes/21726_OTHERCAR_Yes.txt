            I love my little Cavalier. When I tried to decide what I wanted to be my first new car, I had a lot of possibilities. As soon as I drove my little black Z24, the decision was made. The 2.4 liter quad four really surprised me. Don't get me wrong, It is not going to beat a Cobra Mustang in the quarter mile or anything. But, the little four cylinder really gets up and goes. But, the power was not the first thing that got my attention. The Cavalier Z24 really has a cute body. The ground effects and spoiler give it a sleek look that you usually cannot get from an economy car. It came in many different colors, and interior trim options. I have owned my '98 for 18 months, and have not had very many repairs done. It has been a really reliable car, and I know that when I have a problem the GM dealer will take care of it. It has a normal warranty 36months/36,000 miles. My car has been on many 2,000+ mile round trips (Indiana-Florida) with no incident. The seats are not extremely comfy for long distance driving, but the cruise and CD player are great. The car is supposed to last 100,000 miles before you have to tune it up. I still have quite a long way to go for 100,000 miles, but so far oil changes every 3,000 have all the maintenance required. I have a 4-year old son, and the passenger side seat leans and moves all the way forward to allow easy entrance for my little back seat passenger. My taller friends and relatives complain the back seat is not roomy enough for their legs.Another problem I have with the car is the missing trunk release in the glove box. The only way to open the trunk is with the key or the transmitter they give you for keyless entry. The problem with that is the ignition has to be off for the keypad to work. It can be bothersome when you go to the store with a friend and then drop them off at their house. You have to turn off the ignition to pop the trunk so they can get their packages. Also, the seatbelts are not friendly to us short people. The pop out of their guides every time you take them off, and the next time you get in, you have to contort yourself around to replace them or they cut off your air supply at your windpipe. Anyone in the market for a low price car, but who wants the sleek look, reliability and get up and go of a more expensive car should definitely look into the Cavalier Z24. I love driving mine.<br><br>
