            This car simpl put is a gem when it comes to front-wheel drive, sport compact performance.

It's quick (7 sec 0-60 stock), has great handling, fits alot of cargo, and is Honda Civic cheap at the pump.

THe masses should already know this is a excellent car. First off everyone seems to own a Integra, and second their are so many parts for this car it boggles the mind.

Positives:

Easy to modify and make faster- so many parts, and so easy to work on make this car a sport-compact hot-rodders dream.

Lots of cargo- the hatchback allows the car to swallow cargo loads that a coupe Civic could only dream of.

Lovely transmission- the GS-R only comes with a 5-speed manual. It is precise and shifts are firm not sloppy.

Quick - did i mention this car is fast? i topped my GS-r at 140 mph (headers and intake)

Gas-mileage- as gas creeps to the 3.00 mark you need a car that has good gas mileage. Why not one that is sporty too? this car averages 28 + MPG

Seats- Bolstering really holds you well in turns and isn't a pain to sit in for long trips.

Reliable- Its a Honda. 'nuff said.

Engine- Revs to 8000 RPM with lightning speed and drives around town like a Honda. Best of both worlds

Headlights- bright and good beam pattern. Upgrade to PIAA superwhite to get better results

Negatives

Noisy- THe GS-r motor revs high at highway speed. Add the lack of efficient sound proofing and you get a noisey little car. Long trips require you to crank the stereo to avoid the motor's drone. A solution would be to add some Dynamat. 

Doors sound cheap- ever notice how a Mercedes door or a LExus door closes? Like a fort Knox vault wrapped in silk. Well the Acura's sound like they forgot a ton of insulation because the doors sound cheap and tinny when you close them.
Like metal to metal.

Weak AC- the Ac in this car is weak. Plain and simple. It is nothing compare to my Checy Suburbans fridge like AC. YOu need to really crank this little AC up to cool down on hot days. Plus the power suckage from the little 1.8 liter moter is drastic. You will feel a power reduction

Does everyone have a Integra? This car model has been around since 1994. And hasn't changed since (2002 get a new model) It has aged well though. At first the car looked bugeyed.. but know it looks modern and simple. Only problem is every one on the road has a Integra.

High cargo load height- The cargo space is big when you lower the rear seat, but the entry for the cargo tis so high up and small you can't but help scratch the bumper or rear valance paint. The opening needs to be bigger and low to really get those heavy loads in.

stock tires are too skinney- 195/50 15 are stock and the look to skinny and tall. Upgrade to a 205-5015 will help improve looks and performance.

Windows are slow to roll up. Slow power windows..probably due to the size of glass. 

Hot Car- this little car is popular with thiefs..so lock it up and secure it.

In conclusion

Buy this car, and have fun. it is well worth it
