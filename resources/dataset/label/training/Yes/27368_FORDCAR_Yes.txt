            This truck is a blast to drive and aesthetically wonderful to look at, not to mention utilitarian.  It has its glitches as most things will have, but I think in general this is a really great car.

Driving this car is almost like playing a video game.  Turn on the radio, roll the windows down and enjoy how this thing drives.  I know I find myself hopping in this truck just to take a spin because it feels so good to be in.

Obviously, this car has a classy look which is important in its own right.  It is a truck with style.

That style combined with the no-hassle 4-doors and bed space, and passenger or non-weather resistant things area in which to transport, really makes this car useful in many ways.

It's great for camping.  Put all the water resistant camping gear in the bed of the truck and have plenty of room to take blankets and clothes etc. in the back seat so they can stay dry.  Another option of course is to load up the back seat with children or friends.  There is basically room enough for everything you could want for excursions.

However, as with anything, there are some problems though minor ones.  First I think the most obvious one is the bed size.  For the most part like I said earlier, you can fit what you want in there.  Occasionally though having the few extra feet in the bed would be helpful.  Although there is the option of the gate to lengthen the bed, it does narrow the space.

As well, I think some amenities were withheld such as heated seats and headlights that automatically turn off.  This last one is a biggie for me; I always forget to turn my lights off.  There is a sound the car makes when the lights are left on but often I don't hear it.

Lastly, the paint appears to be rather soft on this truck.  So if you're wanting a dainty-type truck that's not going to get dirty or go through rough stuff, then I think this could work for you.  

In my mind these are rather minor things but I figure why not make the car be the best it can be?  Still my general drift is that this is a good car.
