            I have enjoyed this car since I bought it new.  I purchased a K&amp;N high performance air filter as well as as Borla high performance cat-back exhaust.  

The car is fast but falls short of any LS1 derivative.  I think the power is lost in the all wheel drive viscus coupled system.  

The one major advantage of the 3000gt VR4 is the all wheel drive in bad conditions.  I have on many occasions floored the car in the rain.  The result was a sideways &quot;spin&quot; that is possible to steer out of while still giving almost full gas.

I have found it difficult to loose my car.  It takes a slippery road, too much speed and a serious lack of attention.  The car exhibits heavy understeer in Tour mode, and moderate understeer in sport mode.<br><br>
