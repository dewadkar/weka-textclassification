            What a great all around vehicle.  I'm on my 3rd one.  I first bought a mid size 4 door so my parents could join us on trips.  They liked it so well, we got them one of their own.  I traded up for a full size Yukon to pull the horse trailer (we no longer have), so have since bought back down to a mid size 2 door.  

These sport utility vehicles are the best combination of car, truck and station wagon, with an elite look and feel for dependability, versatility and a unique driving experience.  The interior is well designed with great ergonomic seats centrally located, complete with lumbar support for your neck and back.  They're spacious inside, with good head clearance and too many amenities to mention.

You can put the seat down and fill the back up with groceries, or tow the boat down for a day at the beach.  It can be used for primary transportation, or saved for a rainy day.  I love how they sit up, have large windows for better visibility, they're roomy inside, get good mileage and handle well in the rain and snow.  Excellent four wheel drive for the money.

The only pitfall I can see, as with most sport utility vehicles, is that they're a little tippy in corners.  They're not a sports car, you do need to slow down.  They're not for everyone, but are useful/desirable for people with diverse interests. They make excellent vehicles for people with kids, great for trips, people with small boats and/or trailers to tow, or just those who want a truck, but have more use for a car.  It's the best of both worlds.<br><br>
