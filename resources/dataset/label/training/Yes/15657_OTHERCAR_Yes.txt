            Talk about moving pictures ?! This is it, this baby allows you to make a short mpeg movie and record it right on your everyday average floppy disk, and use this disk to send it via email in no time.!Baby's first smile or just to &quot;moon&quot; someone over the internet. No special cables or software required, just point, shoot and ENJOY! I have even mailed the floppy disk to friends without internet access and they can open the movie or the digital pictures without any trouble or the need for software or cables on their end. Anybody that wants a easy way to take pictures should consider the Sony Mavica, I bought it myself and would not trade it for any other fancy digital camera with cables or memory cards.It looks good and feels well in your hands, the LCD screen on the back is clear and easy to look at, and just think, no more running to the picture developing store with those embarrassing pictures for everyone to look at. Just print the ones you like at home right on your printer and whoala ! pictures for everyone.
Get one today and make yourself a happy photobug!<br><br>
