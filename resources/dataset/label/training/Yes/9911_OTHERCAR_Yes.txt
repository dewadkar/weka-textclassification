            I bought this car used two years ago and it is still running great. I had a Mazda Protege that I had bought new in 1991 that I absolutely loved so I knew I wanted to get another Mazda. And I was not disappointed.
I love driving my little red sports car. It handles great and I have never had any problems driving in any road conditions.
This car has the best heater and air conditioner I have ever had in a car. Of course that may be because it is small and there isn't much to heat or cool.
The hatchback trunk works really great for me. Seems easier at times then a regular trunk. There is also a light in the trunk but you have to turn it off and on yourself. it is not automatic.
This is a nice little car for me since my kids are now grown but we do have a bit of trouble when the grandkids are getting in the backseat. It is just a bit difficult to get a carseat in due to only having to doors but the carseats do fit both the infant ones and toddler.<br><br>
