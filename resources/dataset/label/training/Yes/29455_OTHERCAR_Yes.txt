            My partner and I just bought a new '99 SE, it had been our dream car, and now its our reality.  We love it just as much as we thought we would.  Before buying it I had alot of people caution me against it.  Several people I know had had one and hated it-they swore I would too.  I don't, quite the opposite, but I see why they did, and I think its worth mentioning.  As someone said in another review-it does take a certain type of person to be a jeep lover.  They aren't like other cars, they're especially not like the larger SUV's that are so popular now.  They are a sport and recreation vehicle, and it feels like that when you're driving them, (I love this, but if you're expecting smooth and quiet like a luxury car you will be disappointed!).  Driving a Wrangler is an experience-its fun-you feel like you're a part of it-you DRIVE them, they don't drive themselves-its an active experience.
My friends who cautioned me against them #1 lived in the city, and #2 are honestly a bit high maintenance, this is NOT a car for the high maintenance type.  When you're driving fast, its noisy (I can't speak for the hard top, mine is soft), when you hit a bump, you feel it (though it handles them great!).  But if you're into that, into being a part of the experience of driving-it's the perfect car, I've never had more fun!
It handles great, being able to switch from 2 to 4 wheel drive on the fly is awesome when you run into bad weather, its powerful, safe, and the depreciation is great (I looked into it, they don't lose their value), we're planning to keep ours forever!  They are also very easy to take care of (I'm actually learning to work on it!)
I recommend it very highly, but only if your personality fits...
Have fun!
