            I've read quite a few articles about the Camaro Z28 in which critics seem to delight in finding shortcomings with this car.  All I can wonder is,
&quot;Are they driving the same car I did?&quot;  Being something of a sports car enthusiast I decided to see for myself just what kind of car the new Z28 is.  I was thoroughly impressed.  
I made my way to the local Chevrolet Dealer and opted for a test drive on a white 2000 Z28 that featured T-Tops, automatic 4 speed transmission (I understand the 6 speed manual is a real joy to drive), power everything and of course the Monsoon sound system.  About the only thing this test car didn't have was leather seats.  I didn't really mind and even opted for the cloth seats since it was 95 degrees outside.
With respect to the LS1 motor let me just say, job well done by the GM folks.  The 305 bhp V8 cranks out the torque so generously that I really had to watch myself as I drove around on city streets.  With the slightest depression of the pedal the Z28 surges to 40 then 50 then 60.  It's such a joy to hear the low rumble note of the V8 that before you realize it you're twenty miles an hour above the speed limit.  I knew right away, younger drivers behind the wheel of this car are a speeding ticket waiting to happen.
On the highway, the Z28 is truly at home.  Cruising at 70 mph the tachometer barely reached the 1500 mark and there was no doubt in my mind as I passed several large trucks, she had plenty left.  The power of this car is easily on par with many of the worlds top notch sports cars, and at only 25,560 for this particular test car.  Personally I'd offer 23,000 and tell them to take it or leave it.
The handling of this car, unlike the claims of a great many critics, is superb.  It was in this area that I could not possibly see why the critics see fit to berate the Z.  I was easily taking sharp corners at speeds approaching fifty and sixty miles an hour.  This car is glued to the road!  The 16 inch performance Goodyears grab the pavement and refuse to let go.  Ride quality, another area the critics often complain about in this car, I found to be perfectly acceptable.  Over a choppy and uneven road that I often have to take to get to work, the ride in the Z was surprisingly smooth.  Apparently the critics would like a Cadillac ride with Ferrari handling.  They are so out of touch.  This is a sports car and as such the ride is not going be on par with some luxury car.  I would in fact submit that such a ride would actually be dangerous in a sports car.  Sports car drivers need to be a little more in touch with the road then some little old lady from Pasadena tootling around in a Lincoln.
Interior ergonomics are far better then in previous generation Camaros.  I found the dash to be easy to read and providing more information then you will find in most other cars.  The steering wheel mounted radio controls come in quite handy while moving down the road at 80 mph and the sound of the Monsoon is without a doubt &quot;ear splitting&quot; if you want it to be.  The back seat, once again a favorite target of the critics, isn't exactly designed to comfortably seat a six foot tall man for long hours.  Hello! It's a sports car!  To quote a statement from The Department of the Obvious, sports cars are not people haulers.  If you want a roomy back seat, get a sedan.  The trunk features 12.9 cubic feet of storage space, another point to complain about for the critics.  Once again all I can say is &quot;Hello!&quot;  Sports cars are not designed to carry around refrigerators!  Every critic out there seems to want a sports car that rides like a Lincoln Towncar, handles like a Lamborghini, off-roads like an Abrams Battle Tank, gets mileage like a Corolla and can comfortably carry 4 full size adults and an entertainment center.  It's a notion so ridiculous that I cringe to think they actually pay these guys to put their opinions in a nationally distributed magazine.  A sports car is designed to do three things
1. Generate obscene amounts of speed
2. Grab the road and hang on 
3. Make you and your girlfriend look really good as you go out to dinner
The Z28 accomplishes all of these in proud fashion.  If you want your car to do something other than that, you're looking at the wrong car.
