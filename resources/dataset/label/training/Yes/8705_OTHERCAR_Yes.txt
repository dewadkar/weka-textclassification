                 Did you ever think that there would be such a thing as the perfect car?  Well neither did I until I bought my 2000 Honda Accord Coupe.  I bought an EX 4 Cylinder because I wanted the option of upgrading the engine with certain after market products. I also bought the car because of its all around reliability, safety features, and reasonable price.
   While there is a lot to love about this car there a few minor set backs.  One being that in order to get decent acceleration you either need to buy a five speed or upgrade to a V-6 which is a little pricey.  Another problem is the rear seat is a little cramped in the coupe versus the four door.  On the brighter side the coupe has class yet it is sporty at the same time.  The interior is great!  It is roomy for the most part and very plush.  There are many features inside the cock-pit to keep you busy and the car is equipped with a nice sound system as well.  Another feature that I personally love is that those who want to sink a little money into the car there are numerous options for add-ons in the after market world for the Accord.  The options range anywhere from plain simple appearance to raw hard performance upgrades as well.
     Driving the car is extremely fun.  The ride is quiet and extremely comfortable.  I would highly recommend this car for trips.  With the great fuel economy and the comfortable interior it will make trips a breeze.  The handling is very responsive and the acceleration is at least acceptable.  The car will meet the needs of everyone from the bachelor to the mom with three kids.
