            Poor Saturn. The original S-Series cars are too old, too crude and too small. A midsized car is really what Saturn needs. So they give us the new LS, a really good car with really bad styling. But I felt it deserved a look anyway, besides people are always asking me how good a car is. I figured it was worth it to see if I could put the new LS2 on the Mikeman075 recommended list.


Powertrain:

  The 3.0 liter 182 horsepower V6 is great. It feels as powerful as the 200 horsepower Accord and the 193 HP Camry. even on steep hills, the V6 still builds power. The automatic shifts firmly,which is a nice sporty touch if you ask me. However, this engine is not as smooth nor as quiet as GM's other V6 engines such as the 3800 pushrod engine in many of GM larger sedans or the new 3500 OHC engine in the Olds Intrigue and Aurora 3.5, but its not exactly harsh either.

Interior:

  Overall a good design. Well laid controls, easy to read displays and an attractive design hurt only by rather cheap plastic. The steering wheel is ugly to the eyes as well. The seats are very comfy and the rear seat has impressive amounts of room. The trunk is huge.

Steering/Handling:

  The LS2 is German designed and it's handling is proof of that. Very precise feeling car for the family class with good suspension damping and precise steering. The LS2 is a joy to take on a twisty road. The brakes are as good as the suspension, superb!

Exterior styling:

  The LS2 falls apart here. In my reviews, I don't usually include this category, but its what defines this car in the marketplace. The public has spoken and sales for this car have been quite poor. The problem is really just the front end styling. It looks cheap and ungainly. The competition has front ends with large headlamps and bold grilles. 

Overall:

   Its really too bad that the styling has really hurt this otherwise fine car. I've heard from some people on some of AOL's car boards that Saturn dealers are willing to deal on these. I wouldn't count on it but this is a really good car in need of some owners ( and a styling update FAST!!). Go to your local Saturn dealer and at least give it a chance. Who knows, maybe you'll get a deal.<br><br>
