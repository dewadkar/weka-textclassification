            There is one thing that has to be said about this car... ROOMY!  I owned a 1995 Altima and it was wonderful.  When I baby-sat my nephew there was plenty of room to put the car seat, and you didn't have to move the front seat any.  My best friend has this car and lets me borrow it every once in a while.  This car is so smooth, and comfortable to sit in.  When you are looking for a car to buy, all you have to do is test drive this car.  I am confident that you will fall in love with it right away.  

The interior is very chic looking, and cleans up very easily.  The seats are not hard to get under (because this is a very roomy car), so you can easily find missing tapes, or the mysterious pacifier!  

Also this car is very easy to drive.  Power steering, antilock brakes, and about a million horses under the hood!  One other good thing about this car is that it doesn't waste a lot of gas.  And with the gas prices the way they are, I'm sure that you can appreciate that.

I recommend this car to family's, especially ones with small children.  You can fit two car seat in there comfortably.<br><br>
