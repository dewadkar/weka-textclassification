            To start off we need to talk about the Avalon's appearance.  The Avalon's exterior has the plentiful chrome trim and the formal shape of a full-sized luxury car. There is not even a hint of Camry anywhere, but, rather, an interesting combination of vintage and contemporary, Japanese and American styling cues. The massive chrome &quot;waterfall&quot; grille and high, angular shoulder line are the most prominent exterior features. The chrome grille, and a complementary garnish piece above the rear license plate, give the Avalon its American luxury character with a nod to some Toyotas of the 1960s. Although larger than midsized cars like the Camry, and higher and longer than its predecessor, the new Avalon is considerably smaller than its domestic-nameplate competitors. 

If the 2000 Avalon is less than &quot;full-sized&quot; outside, it's at no disadvantage inside. The interior is completely new, and very different than anything seen before in a Toyota. An inch- greater body width translates to increased shoulder space, and the airy interior design makes it appear even more spacious. A higher seating position takes advantage of the raised roofline to increase comfort and visibility. The instrument panel was moved forward four inches, for both increased space and better visibility. Its full- width brow is a new styling motif for Toyota, but will be familiar to domestic-brand luxury car owners. A well-designed, normal instrument cluster is placed in front of the driver, with an interesting multifunction display placed in the center of the dash. It tells time, temperature, direction, and mileage in an easy-to-read manner. Both five- and six-passenger versions are available; my test car was a six-seater, with a 50/50 split contoured front bench and an especially roomy rear bench with a ski passthrough. A steering column-mounted shift lever and dash-mounted key add useful space in front. Interior storage includes a larger locking glove box, front and rear flip-down consoles, pockets in all doors, and very trick hidden front door storage compartments. The trunk is as large as expected. Only in badging and the use of plastic instead of real wood is the Toyota Avalon XLS not a Lexus.
