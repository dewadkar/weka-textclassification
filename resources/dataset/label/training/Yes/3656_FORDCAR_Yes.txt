            I bought a 1999 Crown Victoria LX this past summer, and the six month test drive is virtually all positive.  First the two negatives:
1} This full size sedan does not have much in the way of sex/status appeal.  
2) The only (minimal) fault with the interior ergonomics is the audio system controls are not as convenient to the driver as they might be.

The Ford Crown Victoria LX fully optioned is a genuine six passenger sedan, with admirable creature comforts: leather, automatic climate control, a good sound system, power seats, lumbar support, alloy wheels, a responsive 4.6 liter V8, rear wheel drive, body on frame construction, a huge trunk.  It is as soundly built as any car you will find, and significantly more sound than anything in it's price class.  Ford does not aggressively pursue retailing this vehicle: it has all the business it wants in taxi and police fleets, though it's sister-car, the Mercury Marquis does well in the retail market.  The Crown Victoria gets the highest safety marks, and the interior is reported to be quieter than a Lexus, which I believe (having ridden at highway speeds in both.)

The key words for the Crown Victoria are value and comfort.  Fully optioned, the car may be bought for around $25,000 (list $28-29,000.)  And it's interior size, and drive train are available in cars typically costing much, much more: S Class Mercedes, Lincoln Towncars, etc.  Due to Ford's focus on it's other lines, a typical dealer may have only 2-6 vehicles on the lot, but they are worth seeking out, particularly if you drive the interstates a lot.  The solidity of the vehicle cannot be compared to the frontwheel drive unibody construction offerings of other domestic car makers. It should be noted that rearwheel drive sedans are currently elsewhere available only through Mercedes, Jaguar and BMW
