              I have a 95 Cavalier with 126,000 miles on it ,and this has been the best car our family has ever owned. The most problems I have ever had is about 3 serpentine belt replacements which only cost $30.  That isn't much to pay; I could think of much worse things to happen.  
  You are probably wondering how in the world this little car, being only a 95, could possibly have that many miles.  My father had this car before me and had bought it brand new.  He is an insurance salesman and works in several states.  Therefore, he practically lives in any car he owns.  To make things more complicated he has a bad back and sometimes can barely walk.  However, this Cavalier was his comfort.  It's comfortably contoured seats helped him to find relief while traveling those endless country roads that seem to go nowhere.  
   Not only is this car still running as good as new, it still looks great. In contrast, I do have to agree with a comment I read about the paint chipping on the hood just above the front bumper. I thought it was just my car because while my father owned it, a runaway, passengerless truck came barreling down a hill on Friday the 13th and smashed the hood. To make a long story short, I now have a replacement hood so I thought the replacement was the culprit.  Apparently since others have the same problem that is not the case.  It is not very noticeable though, at least not on my car.  It looks like flecks of dirt that only can be noticed when standing over the vehicle. No one would ever notice it while I was driving down the road.  
   Besides the few minor things I have mentioned, this has been an outstanding vehicle over the past few years we have owned it.  I also liked that the Chevy company contacted us many times to ask us how the car was doing, even after we had it a few years.  That just shows how much faith they have in their products and that gives me piece of mind.  There is hardly anything worse than no service after the sale.<br><br>
