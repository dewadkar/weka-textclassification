            In February 1998 my husband and I found out we were expecting a baby.  Looking at our cars parked outside we realized my small 1990 two door coup would have to go.  So we started car shopping.  We couldn't afford a full sized SUV and didn't want a mini-van so we soon concentrated our search to a mini-suv. We tested the Subaru Forrester, the RAV 4 and the Honda CR-V. We decided on the Honda.

I have always trusted the Honda name for reliability and we haven't been disappointed.  In two years our CR-V has not given us one problem. Not one. We have replaced the oil and get it inspected.  It offers a great warranty and road side assistance which offers a piece of mind.  It is very roomy for a mini-SUV. It has retractable arm rests, nice size hatch,  electrical outlets in the back and even a removable card table.  Even the gas mileage is manageable.  About 22 miles per gallon highway driving.  The heating and cooling system are great and I like the way the seatbelts lock to hold in our child's carseat.  It came standard with a CD player stereo which is excellent. 

The only drawback is that is a V4 not a V6 so the pickup is not as great as some others.  I don't like this when I have to pull out quickly because it doesn't pick up speed as well, especially when the air conditioner is on.<br><br>
