      Lots of room interiorwise. Also plan to add the 3rd row of seats so we will still have room for several adult passengers.
      It's missing some features that you expect from high end GM products, such as fuel efficiency/range display along with other stats (oil temp, etc), temperature selectable climate control, seat memories from multiple drivers, etc. The Cadillac Escalade team could learn a few things by talking to owners and also by looking at the competition, for example the Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer.

      I don't like the fact that the product includes a GPS unit and a cell phone, but these are for On*Star only. Why not let the owner view his GPS information (and perhaps even have a computer connector for mapping software on a PDA or laptop). Why not include a general purpose cell phone as standard equipment? Finally, should have some controls on the steering wheel, such as volume/seek/etc. 

      I like this one but it could get better. Look at all the features and gizmos on other GM products and make sure this one has the best of the best. On*Star is fabulous and hopefully will improve with more features (e.g. &quot;Tell me 3 or 4 movies which are starting in the next 30 minutes, within a 10 minute drive from where I am right now; they know about movie theaters but don't know about movie schedules)
 
      I bought a used 1999 model with only 16,000 miles on it, with hail damage and broken windshield. Price $26,900. Hail damage is not that bad, and windshield is being replaced for $339 plus tax.<br><br>
