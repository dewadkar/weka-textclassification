            I really like my Envoy a lot.  Then again I like to buy U.S. so I really had little choice except to buy a GM vehicle.  Which I am not complaining, I like GM but it would be nice if there was more than one U.S. assembled, U.S. engine & trans (leaves out Explorer),  U.S. owned company (leaves out Dodge and all the Japanese & German companies of course) building a midsize SUV.  Heck, at the DC car show I think I learned that the Expedition/Navigator had French transmissions and the Excursion is nothing more than a reinvented full size VAN so GM maybe the only company to make a truly U.S. SUV.

Anyway, back to the Envoy.  The truck is nice, the best vehicle I have ever owned.  I usually always buy used because of the economic advantages.  But with the dealers willing to take over $2000 off sticker (at least 2 dealers without even asking, I just sat there thinking about what I wanted to do and they would just say, "I can go $800 over invoice".  Plus, $2002 off 2002's (overdrive) and I have a GM card with nearly $1000 that I used.  If I didn't buy this truck I should of had my head examined.

As I here people comment on the fit & finish I crack up.  IMO, these are things the car magazines made up because it would be hard to JUST say, "The Envoy is good and so is the Explorer." and still sell magazines.  My point is, if the parts stay on and don't rattle then who cares how they fit and if the paint looks good what more do you want?  I think that a 1/4 inch gap between certain panels will save you a few bucks in an accident.  Another words, the Germans put together a slightly tighter vehicle and you tap the bumper and it is so tightly connected to the quarter panel that that needs replaced, etc.

I'm not saying that my Envoy has any problems it's just that when I hear people talking about minor things that "made" them buy foreign it is just funny (funny strange not funny ha ha).  I'll let people who live the life of Reilly, like Bill Gates, worry about that sort of thing (although he should be more worried about the fit and finish of the blue screen Windows gives all the time instead).

I have only had mine for 750 miles and it is super.  Even if something happened and it broke down on me I would not fret because I know I am not perfect and neither are the assembly workers. I am lucky enough to have a job (Java developer) where I can make calls, schedule this or that and go here or there (flexible work schedule) and those people on the assembly lines don't get to do that.

As I watch the Olympics and see Americans cheer on Americans that get 16th place as if it were first place or something, I wonder where that enthusiasm goes when it comes to the hard work of American manufacturers.  There's more half pipe boarders in the Olympics than American car manufacturers (just GM & Ford left).  Car manufacturing is apparently harder than ANY Olympic sport so maybe some cheering is appropriate their way.

Now for the top 10 things GM could improve on the Envoy over the next iterations(just suggestions):
1) Add GPS (though one reviewer said the Envoy had it???)
2) DVD should cost about $800 - $1000 (like in the Bravada) and not have to be purchased in a $3000+ package (SLT).
3) Overdrive in tranny would be cool.
4) The rear view mirror could be in the memory feature.
5) Put the DVD in the front seat headrest to have DVD and moon roof.
6) Heated seat should do your buttocks only like it can do the back only because in winter I got a coat on and can't feel the back much anyway and I could use my tail warmed.
7)Chrome wheels as an option.  A reviewer mistakenly called the polished aluminum wheels chrome but they aren't.
8) The running board should be more integrated into the body.
9) If you are going to have headlight washers you gotta have headlight wipers.
10) Heated steering wheel.
11) The rear cargo hideaway area needs hinges (hidden euro style).
12) The memory needs to only store when the button is held because people give their keys to someone to drive and they change the settings and it is in memory automatically.
13) Headrest should be motorized up & down.

These are just minor things that are meant to be constructive.  I would never think that this vehicle is anything but world class as is (already). 

For those of you that buy Japanese and German because of tiny little things that car mags or Europeans jealous of America (Space Shuttle, first EVER to fly, computer chips, military machines, airplanes as it takes several countries to build a plane to compete with Boeing) take a lesson from Yoda, "You must unlearn what you have learned".
