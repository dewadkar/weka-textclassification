               I bought my four door, standard transmission Echo three months ago. The other car I looked at was a standard transmission Ford Focus with a Zetec engine.  There was no comparison.

The Focus was louder, had less space, and had a somewhat strange gear shift.  It also gets considerably less miles per gallon than the Echo. 

I currently get about 38 mpg city driving.  The car's acceleration is peppy-much more so than the Focus (even with the Zetec).  Also, unlike with many/most Fords, when one turns on the air conditioning they do not feel the power drain from the engine. The Echo is capable of running both the air conditioning and the engine at the same time.  While I think the handling of the Echo is good, strong winds are definitely noticeable, which is probably the biggest drawback of the car.  When the wind is not blowing, the ride is quiet.  I was impressed when I first turned it on-I could not even hear the engine noise.

It is quite spacious and tall people fit with ease (I've had a 6'3&quot; person in the car, and he was quite happy with it.)

Some had said that they find the placement of the speedometer odd and annoying.  I actually like the placement of it, though I did not realize it until recently.  With my old car I had to keep looking under the steering wheel to see how fast I was going. Now I don't-I just look to the center of the dash.  It does not take any more time to look to the center than behind the steering wheel-it actually takes less.

The AC works reasonably well, even for the hot Texas climate, although it could be a little bit better.  I've heard they are using a new refrigerant in new cars, and that might detract somewhat from the cooling power.  I'm also a little spoiled because my previous car had an AC system that was the best I've ever seen/felt. A couple of my friends were really impressed with the AC, so it probably is just me being too picky.

Lastly, some claim the Echo is less than aesthetically pleasing.  While I must admit to being a little taken aback the first time I saw the poofy blue bump car looking at me, he has really grown on me and I now think he is the cutest little guy on the road.  People certainly do look at him-he is not afraid to be different (in a very good sort of way.)

One note: I've noticed a pattern in the reviews.  It seems the people who own the car love it a lot, while those who like it least have had the least amount of contact with it...I'm guessing the more contact, the more happiness-I drive around with a smile on my face now (partly because I know he will never break down:).

My friends all want Echos now.

UPDATE 8/31/2000

My Echo is still running great.  The only real possible drawback I had noticed before-strong wind causing the car to sway, is not a problem anymore.  Yes, I still notice the wind, but I got used to it quickly and adjusting my driving to it is no problem.  I've never had him (my Echo) jump lanes or do anything crazy because of wind, so it was simply a matter of getting used to it.

The stereo is wonderful, as is everything else.

This is a little silly, but when I see other Echo drivers coming towards me when I'm in my Echo, I grin and wave.  It's amazing, but they always know why and they grin and wave back too and give me a thumbs up sign!  I should probably stop doing that, but the cars are new and distinct and it seems Echo owners are friendly...

Oh yeah.  It still seems most of the negative reviews aren't written by people who have had contact with the car.
